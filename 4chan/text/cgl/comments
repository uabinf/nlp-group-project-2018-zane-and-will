oh my goodness last years nikkis birthday suit was simply stunning but this was is by far my favorite in comparison it hits a lot of aesthetic points for me i believe were just getting it as one whole free gift right    also any word on the next stamina event ive been hoarding carefully but want to wait to craft the new stuff because i want to kill 2 birds with 1 stone
im dropping my association number here just in case anyone wants a consistently active group we dont all wear lolita but we do have a little discord chat started just for us   id11174  lv 10  sand skirmish 12301330 sat/sun
  what was the birthday suit last year
  psalm of time i wonder if this will come back along with the new one
for jfashions that dont have their own threads
  op photo reminded is is nile perch worth the price or should i just snap it up secondhand been eyeing their stuff forever and i only have 1 can badge im worried about the sizing too im not a fattychan but im bordering on too tall for jfash at 59
  i own a few pieces of nile perch and i gotta say it isnt really worth the price while its super cute just pick it up secondhand honestly
  if you love a brand its always good to support them by buying some stuff 1st hand
  imo its worth it ive bought a lot of stuff from them mostly first hand but also second hand its really good to support them since their style is really unique but for your first time buying them i would recommend second hand you dont know if you will like it and the resale value is really bad   i find their dresses are kind of meh though ive never bought shoes but the cardigans blouses cutsews tshirts are exceptional quality i think the socks are the only thing that isnt worth it the tights are their best quality items too
  seconding this 100 i love every piece ive purchased from them and im stunned the resale value is so low not gonna complain though because i dont mind buying secondhand if the condition is good and i generally keep my stuff until its destroyed
why do you keep making these threads when none of them are in autosage  just because a thread isnt popular doesnt mean you need to make a new one
  fuck i thought theyd been deleted sorry about that
  bought a sweater for around 180 usd  went on mercari found the same sweater i had bought secondhand for 5000 yen  never again
didnt nile perch use to remake clothes like spank does and sell vintage toys it was ages ago but i loved looking through their old website when i was new to jfashion
goodwill have twinkle mermaid up on ebay    
  fuck   sorry i thought this was lolita general
bump
gonna necro this thread because i want more spank kei and fairy kei inspo
samefag nice job  self accidentally posting with my profile pic at the bottom rip
lets try that again
  op here thanks for bringing this thread back anon     its hard to find good inspo on tumblr especially when a lot of the times what theyre tagging as fairy kei is actually menhera or otherwise just not fairy kei
now onto the good stuff
  i hate when people tag shit like this like how is this remotely fairy kei nitpicky but i notice too that a lot of western fk is definitely moreso decora
  you complain about people tagging things that obviously arent fairy kei but this isnt fairy kei eitheror really even good
out of curiosity since i saw an interesting conversation earlier what makes a coordinate jfash to you does it need to involve a japanese brand or does it just have to capture the feeling of whatever style youre going for
  definitely feeling to me but a brand helps define it pic related is uniqlo but they are emulating the paris girl style with this coordinate just because something is a japanese brand doesnt make an outfit jfashion  lines are definitely blurred now that china has become such a hub for high end designers couture is flocking over there and as a result of the fashion trickle were starting to see more stuff like  in normie fashion stores do most people coordinate these items together with the japanese influence no but are the resources for this style now widespread yes and that makes outfits like  now normie on cgl even though a few years ago it would still easily pass as jfash at least tumblr jfash
  its not really worth ordering online but if you can visit the physical store in laforet its really great visited a couple days ago the shopgirl was very sweet and they have a bunch of recycled ooak pieces and handmade accessories that you cant order online and without the shipping costs the price is quite reasonable
  because they are tagging for the views not accuracy which is why tags have no point anymore besides for sorting your own blog
  this is a really good explanation of it thank you anon
  eat ass suck a dick and sell drugs  looks like that  i threw up a little in my mouth
  yes to both
  ok this is super super cute
  god i love this and that sweater is perf
how do you all feel about the fancy brand creamy ice i think its really nice and cute personally
more creamy ice examples im really partial to the way the artist aisutan works with colors when she makes her bags i love spank a lot but sometimes i dont understand some of the harsher color choices when they mix them with pastels
heres a creamy ice backpack i would kill for if only
  can you link their site
  nvm found it thank you for introducing me to this
  link pls
     here is aisutans website its pretty sparce at the moment but she is working on new items to be released in october and this coming winter if i recall aisutan also distributes her goods through spank so if you use a ss like tenshi she can order for you over the phone i think spank may have one of the ballet bags in stock still but the best way to find out is to just have tenshi call spank and ask what creamy ice goods are in stock
released are announced through her twitter aiaisutan and her instagram creamy_ice_aisu
  ugh bless you anon these are adorable do you have a size reference for the bags
  i actually own one of the ballet bags myself i put together a coord with it last night here is the bag in reference to the rest of my outfit its pretty roomy and easily fits my wallet phone keys and what have you hope this helps
  sorry for selfposting lol but here is another example of the size of the bags this is a coord i put together using one of her heart bags the heart bag is huge and fits pretty much anything lol
creamy ice anon again the artist announced a new release of accessories on twitter 1/5
2/5
3/5
4/5 im really considering getting my hands on one of these once they drop
5/5
            im in love
may i request some shoes tea parties and the like are alright but id also to see sneakers or regular shoes like pic related      usually i have this weird beef with fairy kei for looking too cheap and low quality but this brand seems like its actually really nice i love this kind of embroidery look and everything looks thick and durable
  are they going on the website
  i havent seen aisutan say anything about where these will all go but typically she splits up how she distributes them half of the products are posted to her site and the other goods are delivered to spank to be sold there she hasnt done either yet but i think these are slated to release near halloween
  these pics are so cute whats your insta
  aw thank you anon i feel kind of bad selfpromoing in the general jfashion thread but to answer your question my insta is confettiribbon i post coords and cute photos of stuff i own every so often there nothing too serious 
forgot to post upclose images of these pouches included in the upcoming creamy ice release
  i agree with the quality level gripes like i said in an earlier post i love brands like spank but sometimes i agree that items can look a little cheap i really can attest to creamy ice items being durable and wellmade though
creamy ice posted the new items spank did as well on ig
  did a gull snag the strawberry bag
  ive always loved how converse look with fairy kei i had a pair of the limited edition pastel pink ones that i added rainbow laces from daiso to but im currently rocking these theyre completely pink and satin theyre my go to pair rn
  ooh how can i cop these
  
  thank you
  tempting
requesting some fairy kei/menhera type looks with pants  i love how skirts look but i always feel so insecure and uncomfortable wearing skirts compared to pants but its kinda hard to make pants look cute
  forgot to add the image i was gonna post
any good recs for where i could buy leggings that would suit a menhera style outfit its getting pretty chilly here where i am this time of year and its too cold to wear skirts and shorts even with thigh highs
  puvithel has some menheraspecific footed leggings/tights other than that id say try general yumekawaii tights/leggings or even just plain colors target has some
  ill check puvithel out then thanks anon
  
  thanks anon
remember larme
  remember when it was just a magazine then all these westernfags tried to make it a thing
    is it officially dead and over now  i never wore it im more into fairykei but i didnt mind it as a style
  no people still wear it
  the magazine is still popular and girls in japan are still wearing clothes that are following the trends in the magazine but the trends are just constantly changing larme isnt limited to just layering black and pink lingerie pieces its still prevalent but maybe not in the way youd expect
  when larme first started it felt pretty unique but the style has bled over into other fashion magazines and even abroad so it doesnt seem as special anymore
          yeah i can see your point all of those looks look like general street fashion nothing is really outlined as being larme
  i guess that depends how you define it to me its just whatever is in the magazine which is constantly changing and what this stuff is its not the larme that became popular in the west in 2016 but its still larme bc its intrinsically tied to the magazine
  yeah ive stopped buying the magazine it pretty much looks like any other japanese fashion magazine now
  larme isnt limited to just layering black and pink lingerie pieces  and that was just casual cult party to begin with
  like which ones
  strong disagree the lingerie/fetish dressing in larme circa 15/16 really didnt seem casual or related to cult party at all it was body conscious and sexy not loose and angelic and pink x black isnt really a cult party color combo anyways
  considering that amo was considered a big cult party follower and whatever the west considers larme is just a knockoff of her style it seems correct tho
  pic very related was considered iconic for cult party
its sad how many active jfashion communities their were even 5 years ago and now only a few are left lolita fairykei/yumekawaii and a couple gyaru substyles there hasnt been anything new to replace them either even western alt fashions have gotten boring and repetitive     im stuck trying to capture my old excitement about jfashion by looking at dead blogs and old youtube vids
why is nile perch called nile perch
  according to the owner because they originally were a fish themed brand
  theres always the fairy kei discord
  fish themed clothing brand   takes the name of an uglyass fish responsible for the extinction of lots of prettier species of fish  kek
  its not as bad as how wc was based on toilets
  this is not cult party at all amo wasnt involved with cult party kei she was a magazine model while cult party kei was a street style based out of the store the virgin mary
what do you think is the easiest jfashion to get into what is the hardest
  i think mori kei would be the easiest
  lolita is the hardest agreed mori is probably easiest
      why is lolita hard
  because of how many newbies end ita despite all the resources
  lolita is the easiest imo fairy kei is the hardest lolita has a billion resources and everything is laid out for you theres a huge western sales community and western stores specifically for lolita its also pretty easy to make a good coord as long as you follow the basic rules fairy kei is harder because theres not a huge western market so most western fairy kei wearers end up using offbrand crap and looking like garbage
  i think yumekawaii is this easiest since its really broad and describes several fashions just use some pastels and give a dreamy feel    i think decora is the hardest i cant make that many clips on my head look cute no matter what i do
  id say himekaji and fashions along the line of that its easy to wear and pair there many online stores based in us if thats where you live selling only that type of clothing too so its really easy to get and afford unlike lolita
    i disagree lolita is really easy the guidelines are all laid out the reason people are bad is simply because they are lazy they wouldnt look good in any fashion as well as that as the other anon said its easy to get your hands on good pieces because the community is so big and the western sales market is huge   other fashions are harder in my opinion i wear fairy kei otome and lolita otome is easy to coordinate if you have a basic understanding however i see people fuck up otome and look bad all the time theres no resources for it in the west people think everything that is too casual to be lolita is otome   as for fairy kei its hard to find pieces in the western market and the community is small theres more fairy kei itas in the west than there are good ones western fairy kei is a completely different style in my opinion and its trash   im just repeating what this anon said   but i think no matter what i say it would be the same i agree so much
  i feel like cult party kei is pretty tricky considering its pretty dead and no one seems to know what the fuck its supposed to look like i used to wear it a lot but my coords were pretty hit or miss both as to whether they looked good or not and if they actually fit the aesthetic i was going for lolita is dead easy there are a million dedicated brands all you have to do is buy from the right places and have some sense of color coordination
when do brands start bringing out their lucky packs i always seem to miss them or never have the money but im determined to get some this year
  id argue menhera is the easiest because its so simple worse come to worse you can just buy a matching set to pair with an accessory or two however its one of those which people overthink and then they end up in left field i think it might happen because they see examples where people are mixing and matching different styles with it ill also include yumekawaii in the easiest category because the outfits can be quite simple  accessible i think nanchette would count in easytier as well     id put lolita in midtier if you dont care about creativity you can just buy a matching set alongside petticoat and wig i still wont put it in easiest just because its a bit costly compared to other styles classic and gothic would especially go in midtier alongside some sweet im going to include gyaru in this category because its a bit more forgiving regarding brand but its still a lot of personal upkeep with the nails and hair     the hardest categories would go to stuff like fairy kei cult party kei  decora i include your ott sweet in this category as well stuff in this category has a myriad of factors that elevate it to hard whether that be inaccessibility of brand to expense on top of that these are fashions that run a high danger of looking like an absolute clusterfuck i might could include shironuri  visual kei as well since youve got complicated theatrical makeup paired with odd expensive outfits     i dont really know enough about mori or larme to categorize them all that said any style can be as hard as you want to make it
  mori is probably one of the more relaxed styles and incredibly subjective early on it was about layering skirts dresses and shirts together for the basic look but slowly it evolved to be more simplistic its often referred to as a style not having any real rules as long as you had the feel or vibe of fairy tail forest in either a fantasylike way or a more realistic way it was mori if you called it such it overlaps with other styles frequently because of the themes of natural forest and fairy tale in terms of price and accessability you can literally do what you want thrifting buying online making it yourself thats up to you potentially one of the cheapest styles    lolita has rules for people who seek more stability and guidelines but its slightly harder in terms of how the wrong petticoat or pair of shoes can trash a whole coord in some cases if you pay close attention and keep it simple to start waiting to go oot as get a better grasp of it things should go smoothly its also susceptible to being trashy or weeby if you fall into the wrong area of lolita shiny fabrics the wrong accessories etc also its one of the most expensive jfashions and if youre a seasoned seamstress making your own dresses is an option lolita stores do exist overseas but be prepared for a shitton of online shopping especially these days    i feel like the hardest could be gyaru imo the makeup alone takes so much effort and if youre doing hardcore looks with lots of flashy clothes and accessories you have to work it hard its definitely one if the most dedicated styles but there are more simple gyaru looks that dont call for such extremes shironuri is also some hard stuff but only like 10 people wear it lol    as for other styles  easy  nanchatte yumekawaii    medium  menhera    extra spicy  decora
  most do around new years eve listen flavor announced their for the end of the month tho
an artist just posted this 1/3
2/3
3/3
  ive not got much of a comment but i know midnight springs deco has been putting up with a lot over the past year i feel bad for the girl she snapped at but it also makes me worried whether or not midnight springs deco is doing alright you know
  god people who bitch endlessly about drama/negativity/toxicity/literally anything that isnt sharting rainbows are always the most annoying cunts ever
  ok so i wasnt there but i went and talked to some witnesses and this artist is blowing this out of proportion    theres some bad blood between this artist and m so its not fair of the artist to say theres no reason m would behave this way from what i can tell s also is friends with/supports kg and i keep seeing all of kgs friends going after m so i also wonder if that has something to do with it    the whole interaction was less one sided s approaches m while she was at bs table and attempted to give her a half hug which to me is a nono dont touch someone without permission m ignored s s said something along the lines of why do you gotta be like that with some level of snark and m told s something along the lines of piss off    imo m was probably more rude than she needed to be but s isnt blameless and m wasnt /that/ rude    regardless this post is silly my neighbor at my last con was rude to me too but im not going around trying to ruin her business
any thoughts on nah their items look lovely
  this is honestly pathetic who gives a shit if someone doesnt want to be your friend walk away she sounds like she knew she would be provoking the girl in some way and approached her anyways   someone telling you to buzz off is no reason to try and ruin their business
  and im afraid of bitterbat one of my art senpais associating me with drama and negativity    wew
  considering there was some dispute between symbiote and midnight before its more surprising she pulls the booh booh i only wanted to be friends card when she harassed her before
  reading what she wrote shes really trying to up the innocent card constantly reminding us she was crying and being bullied  its obvious shes not innocent so pathetic keep your petty drama offline
  i really like the materials they use anon i would recommend plus they tend to use real leather for shoes
  great quality and one of the few lolita brands who can actually pull off the steampunk look well
  all of that throughout the postso cringy
  theyre great but they dont seem to hold resale id look secondhand not new unless youve got idk a lot of goth instagram followers you can promote your sales to
  dont agree with the people listing fairy kei as much harder than lolita there are less good resources within the western community sure but fairy kei noobs mostly make it difficult for themselves because theyre unwilling to drop the  for japanese brands and determined to shoehorn offbrand which causes would fuck up any jfash except mori larme and jgoth    agree with decora being difficult to not look like shit in and gyaru being hard for most people because of the makeup and hair menhera basics are easy but there are less obvious brands to follow and itd be hard for someone not used to keeping up with jp artist merch to know about new releases      it also became pretty hard to get stuff like fancy peignoirs without shelling out a lot of money unless you had realllly good thrift stores locally
i would kill for a pair of these
where can i cop cute shoes for my big gajin feet im a 10/105
  seconding this im an 859 life is pain
    cheers gulls      real leather  all my yes thanks for letting me know
      most shoes go up to us 13
  itoowould kill for more pastel/kawaii sneakers in general cmon apyou can realease a pair of those again has anyone tried the yru ones
  ive got a pair of yru platforms that i adore theres an open box vendor on depop and if youre wanting to snag some on the cheap just to see how you like them try there mine were in perfect condition other than a small scuff on the left side of one of the soles
      bawws about how midnight springs deco doesnt want to be friends with her because artist is badmouthing her and sending people to bully her  artist claims she has no idea what shes talking about as if she would never do such a thing  posts long story on social media literally badmouthing midnight springs deco and sending people to bully her

  put on some weight you anorexic little shit    but i feel you i used to be 185 and 50
  ur my dream boy ill only have eyes for you
  how are those two thoughts even related
  thats the point  reread the first thought
  yeesh anon go take a walk
is it weird that i think everyone has a single character than they can cosplay perfectly kind of like a soulmate for cosplaying    ive been thinking about it a lot because i want to start on a new build and im not sure what i want to make im really attracted to gilgamesh armor version but i think i would work better as saber prototype both fate chars or maybe something completely different but i cant think of any show/thing that is motivating enough for me to power through it     i havent done a lot of foam work mostly sewn stuff before only making two props but i want to get more into it
  yes it is      100 youre a psycho buddy
    hmph
  lets keep /pol/ in /pol/ please
im selling all my dresses but one i love them to death but ive just become a hoarder buying new dresses doesnt give me that high anymore that i once felt im not excited to coord them i wear them maybe once every few months and i cant justify keeping them anymore aside from sentimental value they make me both happy and sad when i open my closet and look at and touch them but when i get all dressed up it flairs up my stomach issues due to the pressure on my waist and i cant wear them for more than an hour its also partially because i got laid off and need the money if i didnt need the money i absolutely would keep hoarding them    seeing my dream dresses slowly disappear from my closet almost physically hurts but i know its for the best theyll go to a new loving home where they will get worn     at least that is what i keep telling myself to not cry
  not wanting sissies to shit up lolita threads  pol  are you serious anon
  no because she want you to know shes white but also ethnic
  i meant the slurs and indiscriminate use of the word degenerate that kind of posting degrades threads too
man i just really love cute shit
  what slurs
i feel like a terrible human being and my best isnt good enough but people still love me and i still mean things to people why
  it was appropriate use of the word actually
lose a fuckton of weight  literally skinny eating healthy gym 4x a week  still cant fit into any of the brand i bought to motivate my weight loss because of wide fucking ribcage and shoulders  tfw my titties arent even that big
  because people like you and i are fundamentally broken no matter how we may succeed or how much positive reinforcement we receive we will always feel unworthy of praise  ive always wondered if this mentality existed at all before the invention of the participation trophy
  i feel this so hard it kills me that i have a small waist that can fit even smaller sized brand but jsk and ops cant zip past my waist
    probably because you both have undiagnosed anxiety or depreession go talk to a doctor and seek approporiate treatment whether its counselling meds or both
male  ugly  short  unfit  no job  not funny  not smart  not happy  probably some heavy autism or disorders but not gonna bother with diagnosing anything    boom cosplays
  26th birthday   still alive  this is bullshit
  turning 28 next week   planning on jumping in front of the train on my birthday because im a melodramatic piece of shit _ツ_/
  i kinda share a feel i have wider shoulders so while i can even fit mur melche in the waist and chest area im pretty much stuck with jsks unless the one piece has puff sleeves or something
    how do you cakegulls deal with things like ageing wanting to nab a husband money/career/finance stuff etc   i think the simplest retirement plan would be a bullet but if i had a husband that would complicate those plans employers want to know why i dont care about 401k hahaha
  big brown boobs  animal print bra  theres something truly magical about that combination
  28year old anon here  i dont really deal with it at all i take care of my skin but otherwise its kinda whatever imo but im also lucky to enough to age really well so far  but otherwise im with you on the bullet to the head retirement plan ive been saying for years that the best retirement plan is to join a suicide cult because youre going to be fucked by the time you hit that age unless youre a millionaire marrying rich would definitely make shit easier economywise but it still feels like a pretty useless idea
   on jumping in front of the train on my birthday because im a melodramatic piece of shit _ツ_/  you wont do it
  lets hope not
  lets hope so im in a similar situation living sucks but dying is scary theres no winning so the best move is not to play the game at all
  he thinks cosplaying will make him happy   implying cosplayers arent some of the most vain and shallow people who judges everything by its cover   implying getting into cosplaying as a miserable personalityless uggo is going to improve his life   hot opinions there bud
  weeb tranny talking down on others
  hurr ttranny   yikes dont reply to me uggo gross
  of course he wont at best hell take seven aspirins with a beer or lightly scratch his thighs with a butter knife
   thinks cosplaying will make him happy  stop projecting your thoughts onto my posts i dont want anything to do with you
i wonder what happened to brazilian star wars virgin
  he thinks cosplaying will make him happy     god i just wish i knew other people who sew for a hobby i just want a clique to coord with and talk about techniques/progress    shame the community is insanely instagram hungry with genuine talent or even desire to learn being rare as fuck

      jesus christ i turned 30 yesterday and cant understand you lot i have a decent job manage my money and am single do other people understand why i dont want to settle for some pudgy bastard and havent popped out some kids yet no but screw that i have a nice car that gets me to cons i can fit and look good in brand and afford it i have a roof over my head to protect my and brand and nerd shit and i do what makes me happy so who cares about some arbitrary number i plan on retiring and doing nothing but playing video games until i kick the bucket
  nayrt but    how do you cakegulls deal with things like ageing   as long as im alive ill keep aging so i might as well accept it and move forward not going to cover myself in makeup or spend money on bad surgical operations to fake being forever in my 20s     wanting to nab a husband  this doesnt really affect my lolita life but i hope i can marry my current bf soon that would actually make me super happy i think life doesnt have to be about romantic relationship but if you have a good one then youre blessed    money/career/finance stuff etc   i still have to figure this out to be honest im still in university so i have some time but uh id lie if i said this doesnt worry me
  go talk to a doctor and seek approporiate treatment whether its counselling meds or both  thanks to a certain law that was just passed i cant do that ill just be trading one source of anxiety for another
so i met a cosplayer when i was dressed in lolita so he had no idea im also a cosplayer and he flirted with me but i reacted badly and essentially ran away and never asked for his social media tt turns out we have a mutual friend and i found him on insta but im scared of interacting because i dont want to look like a creep what do i do tt
  tt  leave him alone for his own good

taking massive postthanksgiving shit  no bf to hold my hand and unclog the toilet
been to 40 cons this year  one more this weekend  burned out but just got to make it    cant wait to have weekends again
  learn some skill or art
tfw overpaid 120 by not waiting for african american friday
  oof what did you buy
  buying anything on national materialistic hog day  just say no to consumptiondependent economic models    tfw no manslut notbf to watch me take a dump while wearing nothing but a bowler hat i inherited from my grandfather and then fuck my pussy in until i scream loud enough that his cuckqueen bislut gf will hear it
  video games
  just say no to consumptiondependent economic models    yтвepдитeльный тoвapищ
  mosin nagant  ak47 bayonet    so this is ita for /k/ i guess
can we not watch threads anymore
got home from thanksgiving and had to take a huge dump unfortunately my waist tie got stuck between the toilet paper and my ass meaning i basically wiped my ass with it luckily that shit was one of those that leaves no marks on tp but still my waist tie smelled like ass good thing i was home and could just throw the dress in the wash still a shitty situation glad it wasnt worse
  taking a shit in burando  wearing burando to go feast on a bunch of food where you may drop food on your clothes or may bloat and get uncomfortably pinched  why  tfw no family to cook me tasty food  ended up eating microwave vegetables and an omelette
  why  nayrt but because its clothes what are you gonna do go naked
i love these larp troll threads
  gtfo lolita at heart
  why bother
  why not i wanted to dress nice like usual and wore my clothes i dont overeat so i dont have to worry about uncomfy pinching nor am i a messy eater even if accidents did happen i wash my clothing i wear lolita every day why not a holiday
  and as for why i took a dump in it i just got home from a 2hr drive and had to go then ive gone to the bathroom wearing lolita before
my partner and i have been fighting so much recently im trying really hard to make things better and i think he is too but every two days of bliss is followed by one hellish day where we cant get along and just hate each others existence is it worth staying with someone who frustrates you and drives you up the wall 1/3rd of the time i dont know i want to move back home with my parents but they would definitely be disappointed in the amount of lolita clothes i have
  no its not at all    if youre worried about your lolita stuff just get wardrobe boxes and rent a cheap storage unit    also you can always explain to your parents its a hobby and it makes you happy and youre not hurting anyone if they are disappointed then thats their problem not yours
hands are itching to start working on a new cloth cosplay or try my hand at more elaborate foamwork for cosplay or just sew some garments to get better at the basics next con would be anime boston so plenty of time to get something done  literally cant decide on what to do but i know i have to do something     why
  like what would make you cry
  what are you fighting over is it something that will be fixed with time eg are your work schedules currently causes issues with house upkeep or something or is this just fighting because you two no longer get along are small things blowing up into big arguments are you arguing about the same things every day
  your ugly face
  hi anon i recently split from ltr boyfriend we were miserable i had to haul a fuck ton of lolita clothes and move back in with my parents i can say now im a lot less stressed what are the fights about are they over petty things or serious topics
im frustrated with the crossboarders that make a whole fucking thread just for themselves and shit up the catalog    wont lurk then dont post
tfw my boyfriend left town to see parents i dont have any family so i dont do anything for the holidays have the entire weekend thurssun off alone bored at home no money due to buying lots of sets/mtos bills are paid off basically dont have burning money     god i am so bored i think im going to the beach tomorrow or maybe the park to play pokemon go all these awesome luckypacks mtos have got me drained
  this is me so hard anon i have nothing else to say its the worst feeling why couldnt i be born just slightly smaller
  if youre someone who does any christmas baking you could get a start on that now lots of cookie doughs freeze well and it would take a lot of stress around the holidays off your shoulders
  this is a great idea anon i could try that i dont really celebrate the holidays but i love to bake and ive been looking into recipes im also thinking maybe i should create a recipe book since i want to get married and have kids and cook a lot
  recipe books seem kind of obsolete with the advent of the internet
  not really having a copy of tried and true recipes is always helpful plus i find them handy for when im planning meals for the week i have a bunch of recipes written out on note cards and i can see what i need to pick up for groceries quite easily
be me  beginner cosplayer with no real sewing skill and only one solid cosplay under my belt  enjoy tinkering with electronics  make a bunch of cosplans with friend that combine my electronics skills and knowledge with his sewing/tailoring/cosplay experience  both working shitty wageslave jobs  decide ive saved up enough and bail on shitty wageslave job because that shit was killing too many brain cells  200_percent_motivatedjpg  lets fucking nail this costume  friend is now too busy with his own project  never actually get around to making costume on my own  miss con anyway  hahahahaha
  post like these make me sad for some reason its like a missed opportunity to see something wonderful
  it was actually a while ago im currently feeling bad for different reasons so i just kinda felt like venting
    start making props
convention friend posted a selfie of them with a pacifier in their mouth  fucking gross almost deleted  remember that ravers wear pacifiers to give them the benefit of the doubt  today they made a post coming out as a little admitted to having a dd/lg fetish   mfw i dont even have a reaction image to describe my disgust
  177cm here
  why do ravers wear pacifiers
  iirc it started as something to chew/suck on while rolling
  date me im literally abusive and wont leave you
  how are you abusive
  give me one week and ill nitpick you on literally everything you do until i shatter your selfesteem because i cant stand being around you but i also dont want you to be happy from anyone else so i wont take my eyes off you until you seppuku 3
  you sound just like my family
  let me be your family 3
  heres your reaction image    good luck
  no you sound unpleasant but dont fret im not the psycho boyfriend you were looking for
  i dont understand why they feel a need to come out and let everyone know about their fetish i havent noticed this behavior amongst people with other fetishes so why is it so prevalent with this one
  damn
  attention
  are you ok with a boyfriend if hes not qt at all
  doubtful ill degrade you in sex until you cry then degrade you more because crying is hot
  bring it on i doubt you can criticize me more than i already criticize myself
a couple of weekends ago  first date with girl  see eccentrically dressed person that prompts us to start discussing alternative fashions  mention lolita  she suddenly gets excited  reveals she wears lolita  says she normally keeps it a secret until later but its safe to tell me since im already familiar with it  eventually ask her what style she wears  sweet  alarm bells go off  pulls out her phone to show me some of her coords  ott sweet  fears realized  mentally check out but continue date while waiting for an appropriate time to end it  conversation turns to sex  already determined im not interested in her so try to signal that i dont want to discuss this  she misses the cue  starts telling me about how she likes to call her boyfriends daddy  gushes about how its alright to tell me this because im fine with lolita  actually asks can i called you daddy daddy  this is a first fucking date  almost at a loss for words  manage to blurt out that i would prefer if she stuck to my name for now  quickly divert conversation  rest of the date ends uneventfully  havent contacted her since    ive been sitting on this for two weeks monitoring this thread in case she posts here but i think its safe to share now
  even if she did lurk /cgl/ do you really think shes going to tell that story
  not the same way i told it but ive seen people complaining about being ghosted in here before
  i feel you desu    i add people if i talk and shoot with then briefly at cons and finding out that they have some sort of retardation later on just makes me feel weird youre normal irl why do you have to be so insufferably gay/sjw/fetishy online
tfw dreamed of taking a two foot long pointed metal cock and dying on it  woke up wet  body stop i have the most perverted dreams and i just dont understand ii like vanilla
  this is the kind of bf i want but all the guys i meet are vanilla
  i wish i had perverted dreams ive only had two sex dreams in my entire life and they were both over 10 years ago and involved women
  i have sex dreams maybe 24 times a week or more always men or male type monsters sometimes idk how much porn do you look at  wake up horny  nope have to go to work  spend all day horny and frustrated
  to be fair ive probably appeared vanilla to some of the women ive dated/been in relationships with i usually try to determine whether or not i can conceivably drop the fact that i have certain fetishes with them without freaking them out the last girl i fooled around with i went full throttle and she knew about pretty much every one of them because she was just as big a pervert as me but the last girl i was in a relationship had no clue about any of my fetishes because even the act of talking dirty during sex was something she was too embarrassed to do so i never bothered telling her
how do sex dreams even happen    all i dream about is things like cuddling and going on dates
  i wish i knew what i dream about
  its normal to feel sexually aroused during sleep sex dreams are probably the result of said arousal       think about trying hard to remember your dreams before going to sleep think about your dreams as soon as you wake up write your dreams in a diary it is thought this helps people remembering dreams not sure why you want to though many dreams have a component of fear because the amygdala is activated they can be very unpleasant
  i dont look at much porn these days maybe once or twice a week while i masturbate it used to be way more than that but even then i didnt have any sex dreams either
  i have terrible nightmares like 95 of the time good mornings are when i wake up not scared or angry so its better to just not remember the terrible dreams rarely do i have a sex dream but theyre nice when they happen
  you too the best dream i had was me being on a cosplay date with a cute guy thats when i felt happy in a long time
  the best dream i ever had was gliding through the air in a hilly area i would run super fast to the top of the hill jump and put my arms out then i could glide to the bottom of the hill my dreams are super realistic so it felt very real like i could feel the wind in my hair the downside is my nightmares are very real too so when im being eaten alive by zombies its pretty disturbing
  huh i only look at porn a few times a month guess theres no correlation  i regularly have sex orgies romantic dramas dates weird /d/ sex and other perverted fun in dreams     there was a period of like 8 months where i had a nightmare every single night one day they just stopped now im back to having awesome dreams if not sex then some sort of swordfighting or other fun stuff feels good man
  ever taken melatonin
  i tend to have a lot of dreams that revolve around me trying to accomplish some task finishing homework or writing exams is a big one even though ive been out of school for 6 years im not sure why my brain would rather do mildly stressful things in my dreams than get rawed by a tentacle monster but it seems unfair
my dreams are almost always about being chased by someone/something that is trying to kill me although last night i dreamt i was chasing someone and trying to kill them they got away
  i have those sometimes but rather than chasing/running its trying to punch something and my punch is so slow and weak it does nothing really sucks less frequent now maybe once a month or two only had the running dream a few times    idk i also fantasize for about 30 minsan hour while laying in bed usually accompanied by masturbating at the end then i go to sleep maybe im setting the stage for sex dreams by doing that never been able to manifest my husbando but ive seen other /cm/ guys in my dreams i was almost able to lucid dream a few times but never managed to get all the way lucid maybe i should keep trying being with my husbando in my dreams sounds like a dream come trueheh
  why dont we nonvanillas have a codeword of some sort    i dont use fetlife or go to local events because most of the guys are 40 their fetishes are hard limits or theyre generally shady i want a normal relationship with a kink element not a relationship based solely on kink i feel like i need a miracle like the stars need to align or some shit
  i masturbate before i sleep almost every night too usually for about 2030 minutes and i think about all kinds of depraved shit i guess my brain just doesnt want to keep that going when i sleep _ツ_/
  i want a normal relationship with a kink element not a relationship based solely on kink  i can relate to this i also want the nature of our sex life to be kept solely between us
    tfw no loyal kinky seagull gf to destroy be destroyed by cuddle with come home to and simultaneously shitpost on /cgl/ with during downtime
  tfw have this  its a good feel dont give up gulls      even the act of talking dirty during sex was something she was too embarrassed to do  im still too embarrassed to do this unless my so forces it out of me but were both very perverted i just get embarrassed easily its better to just ask her so there are no misunderstandings
  ha jokes on you im a masochist
  i had a dream i got raped by aliens once does that count
  i tried believe me she just flatout refused to even try it despite the fact that we were entirely comfortable with eachother think it was just a lack of sexual experience in general i was her first
  this is purely out of perverted self interest but what did the aliens look like
the person who keeps refreshing my item page up to 150 views  buy it you coward
  f5
i got sexually assaulted at a con and i became a basketcase because of it
  this is purely out of perverted self interest but what happened
  imagine learning sewing just to be able to fit into your cosplay
  im sorry anon i hope you can heal with time and i hope the person that did that to you suffers
  got a throwaway email
  throwawayfeelsgmailcom
  im actually impressed that address wasnt taken already
  making a throwaway email so that you and another dude can larp and jerk off to a fake rape story    i hate crossboarders
  ive been a seagull for years anon doesnt mean im not a pervert
i wish i had a healthy sex life and a loving relationship
  have been sexually assaulted several times  dont give a fuck about it  to be fair youre the sane one anon id love to understand why other women get upset over it go ahead and commence downboats my emotions are really screwy as it is more or less absent feels sort of like being colorblind idk i might be literally autistic i guess im supposed to be upset about it but im justnot     my sex life is one guy who pays me and random hookups to fill in the gaps and im still horny all of the time sick this week period next week gonna be 2 fucking weeks until i can get laid again and these tinder fuccbois are flaky as hell or damned liars   i just want a qt bf to screw my brains out on the daily
  im supposed to be upset about it but im justnot   my sex life is one guy who pays me and random hookups to fill in the gaps  okay i definitely need to know more  
  fuck your email shit more idk im a sociopathic slut who loves cock not much more to tell once youve had one dick youve had them all rape or not its all the same shit
tfw you make one post talking about how you like to degrade girls in sex and you wake up to find it derailed the entire thread
  cmon indulge me i want to hear fucking more of this    absolutely based anon
  it isnt about being a pervert plenty of us are perverts myself included its about not being pathetic and creepy about trying to get contact info from whats at best some dude lying so you two can erp together and at worst making a woman who went through a traumatizing experience relive that
  its about not being pathetic and creepy about trying to get contact info  except i never asked for any contact info someone requested it from me  at worst making a woman who went through a traumatizing experience relive that  im pretty sure theyre reliving it by themselves if theyre voluntarily coming into one of these threads and announcing to everyone they were sexually assaulted please stop dribbling all over your keyboard with stupid posts like these
  right im saying thats the worst case scenario because its 99 likely that its just a dude larping im saying that regardless of the outcome its shitting up the thread and being pathetic
  if youre so sure its a dude larping then why the fuck do you care  its shitting up the thread and being pathetic  oh god no somebodys shitting up the designated offtopic shitpost thread with offtopic posts yeah wed much rather listen to you cry for the thousandth time about how everyone you dont like here is an ebul crossboarder
im so glad that im an ugly girl that never goes outside
  same
  literally like ayylmaos sorry they werent hot
tfw no seagull gf to worship my cock
i hope everyone has a great thanksgiving
just ordered shapewear that was on sale for black friday its supposed to act as a corset and a butt enhancer im really hoping itll give me anime proportions
  uhhhhyoure a bit late on that about 4 days late
  in my head i thought they were going to be like the pillar men but that actually makes more sense
  same to you 3
  i did how was yours
tfw no cgl gf to make me worship her feet
  spotted the male rper
cmon gulls i know more of you are repressed turbosluts tell us your secrets
   tfw im in a loving sexual relationship with a wonderful partner and dont really get the urge to talk about it    all of you are just male roleplayers just admit it no sexually satisfied woman is gonna talk about it even the repressed turbosluts tend to keep it to themselves because duh theyre repressed
  i regret that i was too much of a shy awkward turbonerd to smash all the puss that was around me in hs i knew a bunch of bisluts who were dtf pretty much anyone one girl even pinched my ass and told me how horny she was and i was probably just like yyeah and walked away
ive never felt so misunderstood before im not even straight or vanilla
why so many thirsty anons  is it cuffing season or are there more shitty cross boarders as usual
  the weathers getting colder so people crave the warmth of another human more than usual and this is one way it manifests
  so cuffing season
  tfw no bicurious bff to fool around with and explore plush tiddies and girlbutts  actually ive been with girls before and its just kind of awkward and unfulfilling tfw straight and all the tumblr muh sexuality is a sliding scale everyone is bi was bullshit all along   ill say it i love cock you cant beat the cock  id still fuck around with a girl just for the novelty though girls are great to make out with because every part is soft and nice but for actual sexual gratification it needs to be a guy something about resting on guychest after a sweat inducing fuck with multiple orgasms is just so gratifying   filename everything about blonde is literally me
  this is the first time ive ever heard that phrase so yeah sure
  do you prefer a guy to finish inside you
  more like merry xmas
tfw no gull slut gf to dp
  ill say it i love cock you cant beat the cock    no woman has ever typed this
  t repressed slut
  you have clearly never been on /d/ before
  im not on birth control and dont use condoms so that would cause problems
  so that would cause problems  but itd still feel so wrong but so good
thanksgiving is over which means christmas has officially started  family is now bugging me about what i want for christmas  dont have the slightest idea because we have an unwritten price limit of like 50  what do you do when everything you want is too expensive it also doesnt help that if they cant buy it on amazon or in a store they have no idea what to do
  cums smells awful actually and i dont want it inside me my cunny has a nice fragrance and i dont want it polluted with disgusting mancum  also this is a direct statement to gemposters fuck off with your /sticc/s /thicc/ is superior
  ask for 50 cash
  but my cum smells like pineapples
  sorry i ruined your jerk off session with the realization that a man wrote that      i spend a lot of time on /d/ i also know how women type
  anyone who types something even remotely sexual on /cgl/ is a man  feminism sure has done so much for us
  fuck off incel    in that case douzo onegaishimasu oniichan
  ok so how do women type
  oml youve actually asked for cash gifts
  if it were that easy i wouldnt have said anything i tried that last year and wound up getting a bunch of random gift cards to places i never go because anon you didnt give us a list so we had to guess    im not looking for actual answers im just screaming into the void
  ok ive got it  type up a list of 10 items  it will say  1 5 cash  2 7 cash  3 3 cash  4 9 cash  5 1 cash  6 2 cash  7 8 cash  8 5 cash  9 a hug  10 10 cash
    you say that like thats what i wanted to do  anon what do you want for christmas  nothing really everything i want/need i should really buy myself because most of it would be coming from ebay  come on there must be something  there really isnt  what are we supposed to give you then  i dont know money or just hold off for four more days until my birthday when its totally acceptable to give cash  cue envelopes full of gift cards to movie theaters and walmart that are still sitting on my desk
  heres your thiccccc
  inferior behold the power of thicc soft girlthighs
  i like thicc too but theres something so alluring about the gems androgynous figures and fitted rompers
  tfw you will never be on the left holding someone else lovingly
  no look at this plump lizard
  ミンク  doth  which one is it
  tfw youll never be on the right being held lovingly
    am i hallucinating or do you guys not know your left from right
  im speaking from the beds perspective
  tag yourselves im the pillow
go through a usual monthly ritual where i get drunk sign up to tinder plus swipe on everything and then refund it the day after  only ever match with normalfags who dont write back 90 of the time whore on tinder just for friends   life is suffering
  the lizard princesss name is mink read the manga fagert
  i think i get it now thats just a really awkward translation
  such are scanlations of 80s  mangoes
  late 80s early 90s
  better days cuter outfit designs
  it was acceptable to have poofy hair back then
  he buys tinder plus  lmao thats like buying grindr gold who the fuck does that sis
  poofy hair  /m/ approves
tfw go to have a cosy night in with anime and snacks and you open the bag of ketchup chips and theyre stale
  eating food in 2018  its all about the /sips/ now if 60 of your calories dont come from beverages youre doing it wrong     giant hair  enormous shoulder pads/armor  tiny waists  thick thighs  bikini armor  pointy long shoes  giant perky tits sometimes in pointy bras  it was a crazy time
  i have ginger peach lemonade it was going to be a great night
  it has never bothered me either on some level i kind of feel flattered by it
  i feel this ive got that courtney love broad ribcage
    tfw not attractive enough to be sexually assaulted
entire social circle has been gradually giving me the cold shoulder since spring  no longer invited to parties hell they are even kept secret from me  have no idea what the fuck is going on  sometimes i see people from that circle and they just give me a pretty awkward empty smile when they see me  few friends i still get to hang out with accidentally mentions big parties theyre going to from time to time  they get uncomfortable when i ask about it and rarely gives me straight answers  i have no clue why this is happening  i avoid drama like the plague  i dont butt into other peoples business  i always try to be a fair and decent person  where the fuck did all this silence come from all of a sudden  learn tonight that a chick named k has gotten into my circle roughly around the time people started acting weird  oh dear    i dont personally have a beef with k really but five years ago i had a fling with her on/off again boyfriend he came onto me from the start and i thought it was officially over between them since a while back but it wasnt quite that simple and k has hated me since to the point that she literally stomps on my feet whenever she sees me the guy dumped me to go back to her since long ago so its not like i stole him from her in any way but the moment they got back together weird rumors started to be spread but died after a while as someone that used to be in another circle of friends with her i know she is extremely petty and can bear a grudge for years upon years    but honestly this shit has broken me emotionally im getting ignored by people i thought were my friends the fact that k is involved with this is only speculation on my part but it fits fairly well with her modus operandi against people she doesnt like so i cant help but wonder
  could you nitpick someone whos successful in virtually every way
went to opry mills in my deku hoodie and some girl in a todokori shirt tposed at me    if youre reading this you are a weeb 
make tinder account because bored  i very blatantly put my weeb interests front and fucking centre  first picture is me taking a selfie in the mirror with a chocola daki  have a short clip of squeezing a rem dakis tits  list anime as a hobby  im pretty okay looking not the best but ive been complimented hit on before and ive made out with girls who i personally thought were much out of my league  so i get matches  hoping to find an interesting weeb girl who is also pretty okay looking even just friends so that i have someone to share interests with  i just swipe right to everyone because i am too lazy to individually evaluate every girl  try to message at least the ones i find attractive even if it doesnt look like theyre a weeb because they might not be upfront with it  even the ones who are weebs fucking suck at conversation  im the one asking questions expanding on their responses and adding my own opinions and anecdotes to the conversation to encourage them to do the same  never get the questions returned they never comment on my responses  even talking about weeb hobbies they are some of the most uninteresting dry and boring conversationalists ive ever met  this includes the girls who message me first they dont hold the conversation at all  end up just unmatching about 20 girls because theyre barely even human with their terrible personalities    like im okay with taking a few hours between responses because i do the same busy and stuff but please get a fucking personality
  london
  maybe you should look at the common denominator in all of those conversations pal
  never had problems with talking to girls before only girls over tinder
  everyone has a personality there are just varying levels of comfort with displaying it to strangers
  recently an anon encouraged me that if i lost enough weight id lose around my ribs too but this is honestly my biggest fear regarding lolita im a 38a and 190 lbs and i know a lot of it is fat but even if i get down to my 130 lb goal weight my head hands and feet are wide and im just convinced there is nothing i can do to get down to a 34 for the things i want to wear are we cursed can a corset help or is that just asking to hurt myself because i know that girls used to fuck up their internal structure by using them improperly
  38a    if that measurement is correct your ribcage is huge and theres not much you can do about that
  38a and 190 lbs  that is unfortunate
  i fully understand im usually not so brazen with my personality and interests irl either i just thought if i want to attract the type of people i want i should be upfront first with my interests and take lead but its not like im asking explicit or personal questions just really basic stuff to see if theres some compatibility or interest between us    what do you study  what do you for fun  do you like x  how do you feel about y    usually get a statement sentence in response yeah i really liked x    no returning the question    no expansion on why they like x    like as a guy trying to learn about you just giving me a short sentence stating the you like x makes it very hard to have a conversation that isnt basically an interview or an interrogation depending on how you look at it of you
  pull a measuring tape really tight around your underbust  if it can sink in a lot then chances are you do have a reasonable amount of fat around that area so with 2040lb of weight loss and corresponding decrease in body fat  you should see some change there a corset can only help reshape the floating ribs which is much lower than where you measure your underbust measurement
  try being more discerning with the people you swipe whichever direction means yes on connecting with people who actually interest you might result in better conversations
  its because youre asking the same questions that every girl has been asked 100 times before by every dude who swipes right on everyone just like your lazy ass did
  come to /cgl/ looking for tips  everyone acts a jackass because its a blue board and pretends the answers are commonly posted because theyre all 12 and think it makes them sound like experts blue board brain cancer  theyre literally never posted  no sources for information  just idiots dressing up as little girls and shitposting  i actually want to make nonpedo costumes
find out about the irs thot patrol thing going around right now  smug sense of happiness and satisfaction    honestly im just happy that thots no longer have the ez lane anymore or at least the dumb ones dont       this board is heavy lolita focused the diy and progress threads are rare and inbetween between both /fa/ and /cgl/
  find out about the irs thot patrol thing going around right now  this is brilliant thanks for sharing
  this board is just more 4chan cancer this site isnt just stupid its also become boring in the past half decade theres practically no reason to be here anymore
  i suppose youre right      i dont know what else to ask them to measure basic compatibility yeah im asking basic questions and i want it to be over with asap as well hoping that i can get them to open up at least a small bit so i can use that as a springboard for more interesting conversation i feel this is just normal initial interaction with strangers not like im going to ask them what their favourite neko from nekopara is or their favourite scene from euphoria straight out of the gate    im not a dog but please just throw me a bone
  yeah im asking basic questions and i want it to be over with asap    so youre asking questions that you dont actually care about the answers to not to mention that youre asking these questions to people you arent even truly interested in since you swipe right on everyone women can tell this its why theyre barely responding if they answer at all because theyre tedious and boring questions that theyve been asked a million times    not like im going to ask them what their favourite neko from nekopara is or their favourite scene from euphoria straight out of the gate    why not if you already know the person is interested in this stuff theyre probably going to be 100x more excited to talk about than be asked so what did you study in uni for the 12th time that day
  i dont know what else to ask them  yikes i think thats a personal problem hun
  then what do i do    im not sure if youre the same anon but they pointed out that people are inherently more closed off to strangers but now youre telling me that i should skip off the basic questioning    tinder is the quintessential definition of quantity over quality within dating i dont feel theres much stock in being truly interested since i cant be truly interested in 6 selfies a 10 word bio i know almost nothing about them i know they look attractive and thats about it    why not  because   there are just varying levels of comfort with displaying it to strangers
  im not that anon    i dont think you need to skip basic questioning altogether but as you said its a numbers game why should a girl respond to your boring question when shes gotten 10 others exactly like it youre going to stand out way more if you ask her about something shes chosen to present already    and you dont have to be ready to move in together and start a family interested to know that youd get along with some people more than others someone mentions they like anime you see a figure of a character you like someone wears an alternative fashion you think is neat someone quotes your favourite song great youve got more of a starting point with them than someone whose profile contains none of your interests these are the kinds of people you should be focuses on tailoring your messages and questions to what they have given you and youll be able to have more interesting conversations from the jump
  the fact is they do respond but they just respond with dead end answers    i mean i get your point effort  results i was mainly just having a melty sperg about why even bother responding to me if the question is boring theyre just wasting their time and mine    but ill be sure to post results if did you like when rinne jerked him off with her hair in ep 4 gets me anywhere
    well based on what youve been asking you want to start a conversation based on essentially closed ended questions asking for singlesentence answers not actual discussion even your last sample question here is a yes/no answer and it sounds like you have no idea how to continue a conversation based on any of the answers even if they happen to be interested in the same things
  theyre probably responding with boring answers because not responding at all sometimes causes dudes to freak the fuck out and send threats and shit because some dudes dont seem to handle rejection very well    and honestly some girls are probably just on there to get a bit of attention when they feel like it and the rest of the time its a bother so they dont put the effort in    and yeah i wasnt trying to ream you out too hard or anything i know that tinder is just a crap shoot most of the time regardless of what side youre on    and hey it might work the last guy i dated and i started talking because i messaged him so we could both talk about which kamen rider series we hated you never know what can spark that connection
i remember when the feels thread used to actually be about lolita con and cosplay feels and not fucking tfw no bf/gf and sex dreams holy fuck go to 
help me /cgl/ im too pure for this stuff    con with friends at final day  cosplaying kano  one of my friends friend join our group  that girl is well know for being a bit pervert   shes cosplaying some girl from hotd   ripped outfit with a huge torn on the the side of her skirt but didnt paid much attention at the time  at some time she sat close to me and talk usual stuff  at other times she asked us to do her photoshoot with some lewd posing  she was there the whole con walking with us  i just minded my own bussines and my own fun  next day comes in and all girls on the group are discussing about the con  sudden the pervert girls friend mention that this girl was pantyless the whole con for coplay reasons  some other girl confirms that  im in total shock  i start to wonder why she did that if anybody saw if everytime she was climbing the stairs anything was visible if her skirt lifter at some wrong time i remind everytime she crouched or sat on my direction what i could have seen  my mind goes into a storm  its still is  im still wondering how could she do that and act all normal on the day on such populated place    i cant take it /cgl/ this is too much for me im too embarassed to talk about this to anyone but here
  oi fuck off i posted cosplay feels
  im all for someones right to go commando but doing this at a con when there are lots of kids around is gross
  agreed fuck off you thirsty hoes
      fuck me i went off the band size on my bra i have literally been going by that size for years because of discomfort at a 36 and now that i checked with tape it says 36 1/2 inches i am an idiot sorry for wasting your time    still not sure if itll go down but ill do my best to lose the weight
bf cosplays rutile wants me to be his padpar   tell him id like to but im not paying for the wig and supplies   he offers to buy everything for me   fuck yeah
  accepting gifts outside of actual celebrations
  have you never been in a relationship before random gifts for no reason are the best part    feels good seeing your partner smile when you surprise them with something nice
i comfort myself knowing that like 10 people tops post on /cgl/ and this is by no means a crosssection of what the whole cosplaying community is like    the whole sex negativity here is a real turnoff
  rejecting your boyfriends gift will hurt him as much as if you had rejected his love
scolling through lolibrary  am  casual event w/ mom and her firends  and sitting next to mother while she talks to some chinese acquaintance  mom likes lolita  particularly old school bc it resembles what she wore as a teen  mom sees what im looking at on phone  mom says hey what do you think of this to chinese friend  mom motions at me to show her my phone  i show chinese lady pic related    oh yeah that looks like cosplay    what actually what
  what the fuck anon sex positivity in my feels thread fucking crossboarding male larper reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  some normies think anything out of the ordinary to them is a costume and there are plenty of cosplayers or just weebs think that anything japanese is related to cosplay and/or anime hence why they say lolita fashion cosplay like retards its silly but thats just how people are  did you tell her what it actually is or did that part of the conversation end there
  mom sees what im looking at on phone  mom says hey what do you think of this to chinese friend  your mom would annoy me greatly
  i kind of mentally blacked out after that but i remember explaining that it was a fashion based on old european fashion that its also popular in china and that certain brands cater to the rich population of china and are used as status pieces something like that
  i guess we have different personalities friendo
suddenly want hormonally speaking to be impregnated  want to marry an asian guy and make cute high iq hapa babies with cute dark almond eyes and dark silky hair  logically speaking kids would be horribly expensive ruin my life shit all over the place puke all over be annoying and ensure i never retire early also bust the puss  ive always despised children and i have the warmth and empathy of a snake  body stop why
  i think you got a new fetish anon
  this    i used to love buying my ex gifts it made me so happy even just little things like i would buy her a chocolate when i was out shopping or i would be out shopping for clothes or something for myself and i would see something she liked and buy that instead of what i wanted and i could imagine the joy and happiness in her voice and doing that cute girly squeal of excitement getting tackled to the ground with tight hugs and drowned in kisses    then she started to dislike me giving her gifts when our relationship went sour she said it felt like i was only doing it to gain leverage over her then the last time i tried to gift her a set a fake eyelashes i knew she liked and she said she didnt want them if they were coming from me and told me to return them
  half the posts are about sex positivity is not being a slut  the other half are tfw no bf    i have no issue with hoeing around but i dont get why those two frequently overlap you either settle for one or the other theyre practically exclusive
  i dont think anyone here has a negative attitude towards sex just promiscuity and infidelity
  being open and talking to people about what bothers them about you is the best way to combat a rumor dont slander her name either itll make you look worse you still have your place in the comm i believe in you
  i once had some guy pay me 50 to talk to him for 20 minutes and the whole conversation was like this like dude why pay for an interaction if youre not going to put any effort into making it pleasant some people are just weird like that i guess
  i once had some guy pay me 50 to talk to him for 20 minutes  how did that even come about
  im a sex worker he came into my brothel as a walkin but hes banned from seeing the girl he wanted to see because she hates him so i guess he decided to just chat to me instead idk im not going to pretend i understand how clients think at all
  so he couldve even had a cheeky wank in the meantime but he just sat there and talked instead absolute madlad
  he literally could have had sex and a blowjob for that money but chose to put me through an awkward conversation instead maybe thats his fetish or something
  whereabouts are you based i want to bone a gull brazzer
  haha im not gonna post where i work on /cgl/ sorry anon i move around a lot and takes months at a time off work anyway just ask every girl you see if shes ever posted in the feels thread also i dont do porn but if i did i dont think brazzers would hire me im pretty plain
  go to brothels offering 50 for information as to where you might find a /cgl/ poster   its genius and foolproof
  brazzers just slang for a prostitute i didnt mean the actual site and you dont have to post it here do it with a throwaway ive never been to a brothel before
  oh its like a corruption of brass sorry anon youll just have to track me down yourself
  gotta at least give me a hint and even if you dont want to tell me exactly where you are id love to hear your stories im sure you have quite a few
  honestly my life is pretty mundane i work eight hour shifts and usually at least half of that is spent sitting on the sofa eating chocolate i tried to do the fancy belle du jour thing for a little bit but desu its not for me i like that i dont have to remember my clients names or spend 90 of my days off updating my twitter
  what about stories to do with your clients im sure youve had some weirdos interesting people or lads whove had fucked up/specific requests
  i want to bone a gull brazzer  how much are you offering anon
  depends on what youre offering ofc
new  
  im none of the people youve replied to but im curious how well does it pay are you in a country that its legal is it taxed like regular income whats your plan for when your looks arent good enough do you think its negatively impacted your view of men do you still have romantic relationships with men why did you go into it what got you into /cgl/  aware you have no motivation to answer these but for whatever reason a prostigull really piqued my curiosity
  but for whatever reason a prostigull really piqued my curiosity  because yer a horny basterd
  no im no
  thank you anon that actually means a lot to me    im on it doesnt help much
  in my experience people on tinder are 99999999999 disinterested plebs 00000000001 absolute gems for the most part its not worth your time to go on it but sometimes very rarely you meet someone who you really click with and life feels good for a short while
  179cm  when i go to asia im an entire head taller than anyone else  lel
the all these 50 off sales edition  last one       bodyline is having its third 50 off sale in the last few months with additional free pmail and fixed fee ems
to all the other gulls missing their pmail check your tracking i have a feeling we all still have the same updates
  checked all three of mine    one reached jersey  one left jersey  one is in my home state already    usps is fucking weird
how much do you have to spend in order to get free shipping and do they still lower declared value sorry for the dumb questions but ive always been confused by bodylines sales
  pmail is only for one item free   ems shipping flat rate above 1 item
i added to my cart one item a cosplay but only appears the ems option for shipping not the pmail one anyone with the same problem as me
  has to be below a certain weight
  like a year ago i bought a cosplay with more things and heavier than this one and they sent to me for free literally this one i want now is a really thin dress and comes with a small jacket so idk
  same anon here i tried with a nurse costume for halloween and i can only choose ems shipping the pmail option doesnt appear
  theres an error with the points where when you make a new account it gives you 200 yen in points that are not deducted from any purchase that means every 1 item purchase you make with free shipping will also have 200 yen taken off the final price you can literally make 1 yen orders because of this on socks/tights/etc
in japan   order bodyline in afternoon   it shipped in evening  sick
        i just went to check out with the discount alice costume and pmail worked for me
  goes with a coupon or something because i cant choose the pmail yet     heres the cosplay i want 
  i just went to the purchase/shipping page with that same costume and got the pmail option so you having the coupon seems to be the issue i guess if theyre giving you a discount they wont let you get free shipping too
  yeah but i didnt enter any coupon in the evening i checked the website a couple of times for purchasing the costume and every time i only have the ems option
  odd are you a new account or maybe they dont ship pmail to your country
  thats weird i ordered a few things in a couple different packages and pmail was free for them
  ok i tried putting another country and is that to my country doesnt send via pmail
does anyone have the link to the mr han so angry video
  thanks to your help i was able to get a blouse for 10 usd oh oh oh arigatou
sorry for the stupid question but if pmail is free but its limited to one item can i place multiple 1item orders and essentially get free shipping on all of them
  maybe if you place the new order before they ship the old one or if you put in different addresses otherwise it would be too easy i think but i havent tried it
  sorry i wanted to write after they ship the old one
  its not limited to one item but yes thats what i have done
  pmail doesnt ship to my country either i guess ill never own that sailor jsk
  im sure youll have your chance anon dont give up i own it and if you ever buy it make sure it isnt too short on you it was on me 165cm and thin so i bought m bad choice
  this is what i did as well especially because i could get 200y discount on every single one making each wig like 3 bucks and blouses under 10
  mine is still stuck in new york 
  im 160 cm so i guess m size would be the right lenght but i dont think it is worth ems shipping  customs fees sadly
  yeah for 160cm i think m is good but nope i wouldnt say its worth the extra cost either
question for everyone      what is the best thing youve ever bought from bodyline    since most people will only grab 1 item given how pmail works i figured this might be helpful personally id say blouse l076
    bodyline l348
can anyone help with translating the wig colours
  natural black sapphire blue ash blue lavender blue sky blue snow blue ash sax cocoa brown mocha brown cinnamon brown chestnut brown milk tea brown chocolate brown dark chestnut brown dark brown almond brown ash brown creamy gold venetian gold sepia gold pink gold bronze alice gold    white gray ash gray mist gray apricot orange orange coral orange rose pink gothic violet amethyst purple mauve purple ash purple bold red scarlet red raspberry red coral red dark rouge smoke pink milky white natural white
  is it really not i get a message at the bottom of the shipping/payment method screen that pmail is limited to 1 item 2 if theyre accessories and that if you go over theyll charge you an extra fee  for the multiple orders did you place them all at the same time or did you wait for one to ship and then place the other like  suggested
  thank you kind anon
  i placed them all one after another
  weird i never got that message before and when the 30 sale with free pmail was happening i ordered quite a few things a couple costumes and some wigs and accessories and got free pmail and no extra charges but this time i did everything separate because i could still use 200yen off for having a new account so i got free shipping and the 200y discount on each thing which ended up saving a ton
  i placed 12 orders one after another each for one item with a 200y discount as well as free pmail shipping
  anyone get anything good or want to share your hauls
  repost from the last one but i just stocked up on 050 tights and some 6 costumes
  these all seem to be more than 6 on the website or am i missing something
  you have to click on the items to see the discount price
  thats weird when i look those up the price only seems to have the 50 discount applied mind linking those two costumes directly anon
      okay nevermind i didnt realise the same items are priced differently in the outlet and costume section
  yeah i got all mine from the outlet section
wigs arrived    i cant complain about the quality for having paid under 10 for them theyre about 5 now on sale but the curls on each one are just kinda stringy looking im hoping a good wash will sort it out but otherwise theyre really nice    i added the wig numbers below each one but my order history didnt tell me which specific color i got one is a gradient one is split and one is an alternate color to the model photo
  if you still have the emails bodyline send you when you ordered you can find the colors you bought
seeing this thread made me cave i havent ordered from bodyline in years but just snagged a black simple headdress and white blouse 15 with free shipping alright bodyline you get my money this one time
  i did this with the last free pmail thread for two wigs and i got them shipped for free with no issue
  also interested im browsing the bl site and i feel like there used to be a lot more decent quality/looking stuff and the l348 jsk is sold out which is a shame
  l348 jsk  to be fair the only colors that had been in stock for the longest time were sax and pink and only the sax was left for the longest time it is a nice jsk though especially for 10 bucks
anyone that ordered with free pmail within the last month or so did you have to sign for the package first order came in about a week but all other orders i have done over this time have had issues with tracking and other things plus the one that did get delivered was just left near my house but the tracking still says its out for delivery since october 10
  i always have to sign for my packages from japan no matter what shipping method no idea why
  i do too which is why i was confused that it was just left there and the way the tracking still says its been out for delivery since the 10th pretty much confirms my suspicion that the post office messed up anyway thanks anon
first time ordering from bl from the us was just wondering how should i format my address should i leave it backwards like japanese mail or should i edit it so its formatted like addresses in america   i feel so dumb
  just fill it out how they ask for
got my bodyline halloween sale order when i first saw the box i thought i had gotten someone elses order never gotten a box before
  and then i found out why when did they start selling costumes in boxes
  ive got quite a few of my costumes in boxes grats though anon i hope everything was worth it
  i was actually pretty disappointed when i opened them up the quality is good but most of them had stains on them i guess for 6 each i cant complain but im hoping they come out in the wash    heres my entire order
  thanks for the review i have too many wigs already but couldnt resist ones that are so cheap and look decent like this
  yes because it is registered mail im the anon who is still waiting on my package after more than one month and called usps customer service about it and they said i will have to sign whenever it finally arrives    in good news my dress has finally left customs in new york went to new jersey for a while and has been floating around somewhere between nj and my house for 4 days maybe today will be my lucky day sigh pmail not even once i get shit from china faster than this
  anon i am still waiting for packages that got to the us oct 10 stupid customs first package got to me in a week yep using pmail and all others have been sitting at in transit forever now it went quick until it hit the us but im also the anon whos postal worker delivered the package without anyone signing for it lmao i hate usps so much
  any reviews or pictures of the actual clothes rather than the boxes
  theyre being washed at the moment to see if mystery stains come out before i photograph them the fabric quality was really nice though
  whaaaaat how is that even possible 10 days usps needs to get their shit together yeah my stuff arrived in the us october 14 the mail just came and still no package still in transit im pretty annoyed with usps too rn
  i ended up getting one of my pmail packages today or well it arrived but the mailman is notorious for not knocking so i go check the mail and theres that lovely little slip telling me you werent home either way the tracking never updated from once it arrived and made it to customs so your package might be on its way despite what tracking said
have we ever been this spoiled with so many 50 off sales in one year
also theres some sort of raffle ticket for sale now    you can win autographs or a photography light from the new bodylinechan i guess    
i placed an order last week  a few days after it was sent out it was returned before it even left the country what  has anyone had similar experiences
  they mightve messed up something on the address sheet or not filled out customs properly
sorry for a stupid question but ive been out of the scene for many years  where do people buy cheap shoes now the selection on bodyline is basically nothing now
  taobao aliex their resellers sometimes ebay
did anyone else go crazy with the 1 yen socks  tights bought multiples of everything in stock
  yep i bought whatever i could that was in stock and looked decent
  sorry this is late the stains washed out of everything but the alice dress the apron covers up the spots so i cant complain for 6 a costume the quality is good and they look pretty good all things considered    modeled by yan for no reason
  1 yen or 100 yen i only see 100 ten tights
  the socks  tights were 108  162 yen in the sale with 200 yen available with the website glitch so you could literally make orders for 1 yen
bodyline is shit and any lolita who wears their stuff is a lowtier poorfag
two days ago i ordered from bodyline and i could choose the option pmail but now that option is gone  does someone have the same problem
  did you order too much pmail is only for certain things      every purchase pic so far has been wigs accessories or costumes but go off i guess
  thanks for the insightful commentary
  i have tried it with exact the same product but it was still gone
has anybody bought any sailor moon costume from bodyline ive tried to find reviews but no luck yet
  how long was your package held at customs anon mine is currently sitting in customs since the 31st of october the last update i received simply says storage
  not that anon but my packages were held at customs for a couple weeks for whatever fucking reason
  my pmail package finally arrived today only took a month and a halfordered september 28 oh well at least i now have my love nadia jsk to be comfy and cute around the house in    although i did receive the version where the print is backwards i thought only the really old ones were backwards doesnt really bother me but i was just curious
  most of the newer everythings are backwards lmao squirrel party love nadia etc
  have they actually shipped out any of the 1 yen orders ive received all my other stuff already surprisingly 12 individual packages ordered 10 days ago except my 1 yen orders
  i didnt have any 1 yen orders but i had some that were like 16y and stuff and yeah some of mine have shipped but ones placed later that day i got tracking for but they havent left yet
got my package today which included a couple of wigs one black maxipad headdress and the l310 dress in black and desu im not amazed by the dress there are a couple of things that caught my eye and leaves me disliking this dress disregarding the fact that its not really fitting me anyway     first i have to agree with this anon    i have the original and it looks like shit im 59 and while it fits okay the fabric is much too thick in places around the collar and looks more like a costume than a pretty lolita piece the lace iirc is bodylines shitty tulle lace and looks super cheap    the collar and the bib are also made of thick velveteen just like the rest of the dress giving it a kind of awkward look and taking away some of its elegance going for a different material here wouldve been a better choice the lace on my exemplar didnt feel itchy and wasnt hard but doesnt exactly seem of very high quality either     second thing that i noticed was the white areas mentioned before arent 100 stark white and have a slightly yellowish tinge not really noticable in broad daylight but it sticks out in areas that arent as well lit like my room eg    also as a side note if you receive this dress be careful while unpacking it for the first time the dress will be likely covered in fluffs that will spread all over the floor and stick everywhere the white parts of the dress had also some of them sticking to it so you might wanna clean them off before you wear the dress    all in all i have to agree with the second half of anons comment the dress might not be worst bl has put out but its nothing to be sad about if you miss on it my backup plan wouldve been using the dress for a costume next year but considering it doesnt fit me anyway ill just throw it back on the market    ama if you want to know more posting a few pics too sorry for bad light
  i was the anon you referenced there and its nice to see the new version of the dress i honestly havent pulled mine out of storage since i got it and disliked it but it does look like they might have used a different looking lace around the collar which is nice all and all its definitely not bls worst but i cant even consider wearing it for anything other than a costume its just too thick and weird in some spots and i have yet to see anyone wear it in a nice coord i also had the black fuzzy problem and your post reminded me of that lol
  some of mine started shipping out this morning
    that collar makes it look like some sort of bibbed costume/character jammies
  my sax from 2 years ago and the pink i just got are both backwards im not too bothered either lol its still overall cute
  what size is it im interested in buying it
  size is 2l
any canadian gulls know how long it takes for things to be shipped via pmail   i checked the tracking info and it seems yesterday it was checked into the mail office in chiba
  anon is just bitter about missing out on 1 yen socks
  speaking on 1y socks has anyones shipped i got tracking for them all but everything but my socks have actually made it into to shipping process
one of my orders was returned last week now two more were also returned yesterday the fuck is going on ill probably contact customer service soon
  check the address on your emails to make sure it was right
  all mine have been updated on tracking as of today
any reviews on bodylines seifuku i want some because cheap but i also dont want utter garbage
  eh i have a few and the cheap ones are pretty cheap icky stuff obviously plasticy polyester but i just got a different one during the sale that is actually pretty nice i guess its hit or miss really
  theyre fine no typos or anything this situation is so puzzling
  hm wtf then id definitely message bodyline and see whats up
bodyline at it again with another 50 off sale too bad aliexpress got all my money
  i almost gave in to the aliexpress sales too but ive been wanting a damn maid outfit for forever and i had yet to come across a decent one on aliexpress i ended up giving yandyman money for one of these in pic related but in black so tempted to go back and get more stuff
  oh gosh this is adorable which maid outfit is this
  costume 452  might get myself another in pink because that colorway is kawaii af     
  okay but is it just me or are these not even close to 50 off banner says 50 off everything yet all these items are coming to 30 what gives
  nope have the same
  this is actually one maid dress and an apron from another jsut so you know
  fuck  i just realized after zooming in thank u for pointing that out anon
  the base dress is the one with the heart apron and the apron is the costume452 i have both and theyre both cute but i just didnt want you to get your hopes up and then be sad when it came in not matching the pic
  i had this yesterday but today everything was truly 50 off i got like five wigs for 540 yen each
bought something in the sale got a confusing automated reply i havent bought on bodyline in years but they screwed up my address missing the first line on the email is there anything i should do
im so tempted to get this one just for the adorable capelet hoodie thing its also available by itself but only in red so i think im gonna buy this set even though im probably not going to fit into the dress
  can always see if a gull wants the dress at a discount or something
does the free pmail also work for shoes or are those too heavy/bulky
  it should pmail seems to be 12 items max though
would anybody be able to give a review on blouse l628 im considering getting it in both colors since its cheap but ill steer clear if its not worth it
  l628  i think its super new and dont have it myself but here is a slightly better detail shot
  could have got them for 340 yen each if you made a new account and applied the points each time
i couldnt resist the sale some of this stuff is christmas gifts but i cant believe i dropped this much money on bodyline
  part 2  let me know if you want a review of anything that comes in
    consider me officially jelly review the bunny girl dress in the last pic
does bl sell any cotton blouses i cant wear noncotton blouses i sweat an ungodly amount in them also do they really not sell coats anymore or am i blind
got myself some basics lmk if anyone wants a review
  thanks anon will do
oof my first bodyline order ever  excited for the costumes
  it does have tried it with two pairs and one arrived early last week after being ordered midoctober       would also like to know if its any good ive been thinking about getting this blouse too but i havent found any pictures of it worn
i bought and wore a brown pair of heeled mary janes and they broke my second time out 
  they do sell coats but they are out atm and im pretty sure all the bouses are a poly cotton blend if not straight poly
  that doesnt look too bad although im not the best at judging from pictures i guess at 16 a piece it wont hurt too much if theyre not good thanks anon
      fuck now i want this outfit but i cant justify buying two outfits to get one
    i just got it in the mail today actually quality is pretty good for bodyline it looks better irl than in the pictures if you want to know anything more specific lmk    this pic is pretty accurate to how mine looks fabric and lace soft and not overly shiny
  are the measurements on the bodyline website true to the actual ones ive had bad experiences with that whats the gathered part of the sleeves actually look like irl does it bunch up
  i would say the sizing is pretty accurate i got 2l and have a 92 inch bust and it fits with a bit of wiggle room and no buttons gaping the shoulder width is also pretty generous the gathered part of the sleeve doesnt bunch up at least on my arms because the elastic is actually rather loose usually bodyline has tiny arm circumferences but this is an exception hope this helps
  the cardigan please once you get it
i just got an email that my country doesnt accept pmail while i got the last 2 wigs delivered to my house a months ago and now they are back in japan either i pay 2000 yen for ems or get a refund just my luck
  what country
  both wigs please
  the netherlands
  this explains so much   i have exactly the same problem
      the base dress looks like costume 991i think
  it is
is it true yanners has a wife now
  yep he retired to spend more time with his family
    this is super helpful anon thank you ill be grabbing it the next time it goes 50 off lol
first time ordering boots from bodyline and after wearing them for a day they started to flake im so mad theyre beautiful but does this happen to all violin boots
  oof sorry this happened to you you might need to contact bodyline about a refund or a replacement pair especially if you can provide timestamp photos of when your order arrived versus when the damage happened if its close enough after when you ordered they cant claim you just have an old pair you ordered x months ago and wore too roughly
  bodyline  refund  good luck with that their customer service is known to be a joke
  were you walking in snow/wet areas or something those look way more damaged than i just got them and walked around in a normal/dry area
  i just got this dress a few days ago and while i actually like it quite a bit as a whole the big being velveteen is such a weird choice to me strongly considering removing the whole thing and remaking it with thick cotton or maybe just nixing the bib and retaining the collar though that would be pretty plain thoughts
  i removed the bib on mine and just wear a blouse under it i still think it feels and looks super cheap and costumey though
  boots  cant stand water  nayrt but what the fuck
  bodyline shoes are more designed for looks than hardy daily function
  nayrt but all of the bodyline shoes ive ever owned have been extremely durable i still have two pairs i wore in college when i was a daily lolita and walked to classes and stuff and theyre still in good shape after 7 years theres no excuse for those boots to be falling apart after one day they must be somehow defective
  unless if they switched to a cheaper supplier since then i have great bodyline shoes thatve lasted me forever too but ive been hearing more and more complaints about their shoes falling apart recently makes me worried i just ordered three pairs with this last sale
  definitely possible and that would suck if it was true i love bodyline shoes i did buy two pairs in august and wear one of them fairly frequently though and they seem to have held up as well as the older ones did theyre just the plain mary janes though maybe only certain models have issues
  i wish but it was a dry and sunny day maybe it was a defect pair like  said and not their new standard ill try my luck next year and order new ones
is there any black friday or yearly christmas sale coming up similar to 11/11 didnt see anything on the website and havent followed bodyline that closely for the past few years  not that bodyline isnt cheap enough but i thought id ask
  with how frequently bodyline has been having sales lately thell probably have something near christmas
anyone getting any of the lolita lucky packs on sale im considering but i havent bought bodyline in a loooong time was hoping maybe some cute blouses are out in this batch or am i thinking too wishfully
  in previous threads it looks pretty good go 4 it if u like random
  i bought one just a month or two ago and got a costume petti a bolero a blouse and a jsk they seem to be trying to put an entire outfit in them now so if theyre heavily discounted its worth it
  you made magic happen
  rip my wallet i absolutely cannot resist all of these sales plus the free shipping this time i got some new red shoes to replace my old pair which ive decided i hate and are uncomfortable lol
  goddammit  goodbye money
got my wigs from the 1111 sale they are very okay i mean its bodyline got w066 in three different colors because i had seen it on person on someone and i liked it one is a lot more ginger than i expected so i hope i can pull it off and i got two longer wigs w400 and w401 both are okay all are a bit shiny but not terribly so
  the shoes and wigs from this order arrived this week will review the wigs asap
  update the two pairs of shoes are the same size one of them fits but one of them is too small have any of you had luck with stretching bodyline shoes i just need like a half size bigger
  never tried personally but i have heard of others doing so unfortunately some of the bodyline shoes run small its happened to me before too
did anyone else grab something from the 40 off sale everything i went for that was cheap had already sold out
i have no idea how they shipped my order out but my pmail order only took like a week last month this order was shipped from tokyo on 11/17 but the us post hasnt updated at all it says it is still awaiting the origin country to send it japan post says its sent what gives
a lot of the shoes are sold out on the bodyline website does anyone know how often they restock them im dying for some of their rocking horse shoes but theyve been out of stock for forever
  some of my pmail only took a week or two and some others have been over a month now they got to my country quickly but customs has been dicking around and i think they might have actually lost one alas
  i dont remember them ever having enough of their shoes enough lol its like they cant be bothered id just go to antaina on taobao or buy some second hand on lm
  restocks are random and rarely happen last time was about half a year ago and only sizes  250 for 34 models
    update it came today im glad to have it but sad it came after the salei ordered a few hairpieces and intended to order more once i figured which bodyline color was closest to my natural color now i know but the sale is over ugh
  theyll likely have a big new years sale if they dont bring out the 50 off for christmas first
  not that anon but i was thinking the same thing sales probably get them the most money  im saving money rn to stock up on stuff when they do have another sale
  i may miss creepy ol yan but ill say this the new management is certainly more giving when it comes to random sales weve never been so spoiled
  same right 
  theyre gettinng rid of old stock
  well yeah thats what they have the clearance bin for but i mean sitewide sales
  no they are seriously getting rid of old stock thats why theyre having all the sales
did anyones pmail packages get lost i think one of mine did as it got to customs then hit a wall as far as updating tracking goes and hasnt been scanned since the 19th of last month despite all other pieces moving farther on and being scanned only days ago
  new management bodyline is over for lolita
  some of my stuff was stuck on that for a while and then randomly came in today if its pmail sometimes theyre lazy and dont scan it
  does pmail have tracking at all on bl website they stated its not tracked iirc
also known as there better be girls that like kamen rider or ill cry edition
  my bf made me watch three and a half seasons of kamen rider and i quite enjoyed it i get a bit bummed that there arent many active girls on the show but at least its funny and light to watch
  feels thread kita
  the girls that are supporting characters in these shows are usually terrible actresses good example kamen rider ryuki
tfw no slenderman gf
im pretty sure there are plenty of girls who like kamen rider especially with all of the fujobait in the newer series ooos is my personal favorite
  most people in these shows arent great actors or are overacting a lot of the time but its childrens television so what do you expect
mam i just really love cosplay
  the blue one in ghost is my boyfriend
  yes thank you anon i was the one asking for the thread name haha bless your rider soul      does ooo have light fujobait aasking for a friend    all these riders popping up and now hyped for making masked cosplay
  man i just really love i just really love posters
    man i just really love kamen riders
  yes it does please watch it pic related    its also a fun and enjoyable show even without it
  ankh/eiji are a very common ship
to the people that like/cosplay masked charas  do you just like riders or do you also enjoy other masked charas in general  whats your opinion on object heads  do you like other masked characters/mascots like daft punk no more movie theif etc etc
  im into toku in general but i prefer rider over other things    i have done an object head cosplay the classic monitor and seifuku combo    i dont seek out things specifically for having masked characters or mascots but some of them are pretty cool
tfw have no idea how to make strongers weird chest piece or how to make drives car headlight eyes
  foam would work for stronger drives eyes might be a little more difficult it would probably be best to find some old headlight covers and get the plastic from that but then cutting it into shape would be difficult if you dont have the proper tools
this entire thread is a feel wow im working on my 4th kamen rider cosplay right now  i wish there were more kr fans in my country though the only other kr fan i know pretty much ghosted me once she got a boyfriend lol
  i wish i was gentarous friend
i came into this thread to find friends but i found kamen riders instead    can we take the kamen rider stuff elsewhere i want to make friends but im not into that
  aaaaaand thats because im an idiot and just reread the title of the thread i thought this was the friend finder thread     my bad ride on you crazy kamens
will never get to hold a sentai genjis hand in a dva cosplay  will never be held softly by sentai genji and softly cry in chest from embarassment
  are ff threads even a thing anymore  i would like to make gull friends too
  im not gentarou but i would be your friend
  man i just really love kiva
  overwatch   gross
  friend finder threads  you mean ghost simulator threads
  they exist once in a while the issue is that most people will probably talk once or twice before ghosting and that you get messages from people who you dont want to do anything with
  got ghosted before but at least i have nice memories of talking to those people better than not having anyone to chat with in the first place imo
  ghost simulator    you rang
  being unable to enjoy something because its popular  feels bad
thought i was 59  thought id be 59 forever  grandma commented that the coat she got me when i was 19 looks too short asks if i want a new one for christmas   oh shit shes right   measure myself out of curiosity   im actually 511    i dont know how it happened but looks like i made it to the big leagues see you later manlets
  youre a manlet until youre 6 sorry
  you might want to reread your post
  ive cosplayed this guy before great fun although seeing was hard
want to cosplay this version of cairngorm  afraid of getting accused of being racist    do you think id be safe if i did very dark grey instead of black or should i skip the body paint altogether
  you could go for a very dark blue or purple if you want to be safe but pure black like that isnt really a color found in humans so i think youd be mostly in the clear theres dumbasses everywhere who may come for you anyway because they dont understand what the problem is with blackface but imho this falls into the same category as shadow link
  i stand by my words make no mistake theres no error
thing i want on ya  v cheap  get the thing  two weeks later ww and cc are selling the same thing  for three times the price    this has happened twice this month good feel
not a cgl feel but i feel dead inside not even in a meme/fake edgy way i feel like im sleepwalking throughout my entire day and have trouble focusing i dont want to kms but i dont enjoy being alive and have been spending a lot of time sleeping and distracting myself with timewasting hobbies i wish i could chalk it up as seasonal depression but it started in summer got a little bit better for the first month of the semester and now is bad again i dont even have anything to be sad or upset about my life is really good compared to how its been in the past and i know i should be happy and motivated
  have you done anything new since summer
  i think the best way us to try and think about what in your life in causing you deep dissatisfaction what might be happening is that you perceive your grievances to be minor or not worth dealing with because everything in your life should be perfect i know how it feels and i cant say it will get better since i have been this way for many years even with therapy thats likely i want to change things i cant change but if you have only felt this way for a short time maybe you can resolve whats getting you down and try to do it before its too late or else you end up like me
what is the silent hill romance i want to hear a story
  have you done anything new since summer  i quit a job that was making me suicidal went back to school and stopped drinking havent picked up any new hobbies or friends though maybe thats my issue       tbh i cant think of anything in my life that would cause deep dissatisfaction i dont like being a broke student and i dont really like the town im living in theres nothing i can currently do about that though but if thats it i hope it does get better when i graduate and move   im sorry youre feeling this way too anon
i hope everyone is doing there best and having a great day
  sounds like you have a lot of reasons to be happy anon it could be that you went through a lot of change really quickly and are feeling a rush of emotion after the fact maybe you just need someone to tell you that youre doing well and your decision will probably turn out for the better because of your increased opportunities  ill say it good job you took a risk and its going to pay off enjoy college and study hard make friends in your major and have a good time learning about something you hopefully love celebrate your decision and buckle in for the road ahead im proud of you gull
  sounds like actual chronic depression you should maybe go to a psychiatrist if you have access to that 
  possibly this as well yeah 
  nah overwatch is just boring gameplays too focused on ults for teamfights to be fun and the characters are laughably one note
  so a few months back were discussing crossboarders in the feels thread and so a bunch come out of the woodwork to say where theyre from and why theyre here a few people say theyre from /fit/ and are hanging around because they want to get into cosplay because well theyre /fit/  a few posts later the anon later known as nursechan posts  tfw no /fit/ pyramid head bf  along with some fanart of him this was likely in jest however one of the crossboarders responds to her with some fanart of bubble nurse and pyramid head saying  tfw no bubble nurse gf    pyramid head reveals himself to be a /fit/ crossboarder about 10 months or so into lifting they flirt a bit and eventually part ways saying that theyll both work on their respective cosplays pyramid head continues his work in the gym to get big enough to do a proper cosplay of the guy to keep rapport going he continues to post in the feels thread with updates asking nursechan about her own progress and giving updates as to how his body building is going she typically responds and encourages him to keep going happy to be inspiring his cosplay  the most recent update was in the couples cosplay thread its still around even where he posts a discord invite to nursechan so they can finally come off anon she didnt say anything after that and neither did he  thats the last weve heard of them for now but it was also revealed he posts in the faxcgl discord to get feedback and learn more about cosplay

like to fantasize stories while laying in bed before sleep  have many storylines i rehearse routinely based on whimsy and mood  did a really sad one last night  actually cried not unusual for maybe 20 minutes  fell asleep  went into office wageslave job this morning  strangely good mood  just feel serene and cheerful like a shoujo protagonist who always smiles and is kind to people  joked with coworker was sweet to a person on the bus didnt get too resentful of needing to work for a living  still in a good mood now that ive gotten home  what the hell is this get all your sadness out at night and youll be happy the next day ive noticed if i have a bad morning ill have a good evening did i tap into some karmic law     get out now i had my first job in a hellhole like that just god anon get another job anything even waitressing you stay there long enough youll see hell early dont say you werent warned
tfw no husband  tfw noticing all the guys with wedding rings on their fingers  tfw no one to sleep next to at night  tfw no qt bf
  oh shit i didnt think we were gonna get such a dope thread when i got home hi everyone
  tfw noticing all the guys with wedding rings on their fingers  i have never noticed this how old are you gull
  i assume that if there was an incident one person would watch and immediately administer aid while the other went to get more help     but i agree with  i have a friend who works in one of those places and her stories are nightmarish you really have to love the work and love helping people its such a highstress job
  tfw no qt rider gf
  man i just really love kamen rider
  everyone who loves kamen rider deserves love
what the fuck happened to my social skills i used to be able to make friends or at the very least hold conversations with strangers easily i dont have any friends who are girls in the area that i live in now and i really miss having them especially ones who i share hobbies with last week i went to a metal concert and while i was waiting for the bathroom in between sets i was standing next to this girl who had some cute anime pins on her bag i thought it would be a good idea to try to talk to her because we have two things in common so i complimented her pins she said something like theyre not very metal or something and all i could think to say was just haha theyre adorable awkwardly and then the conversation just ended i know that its rare to just randomly click with a stranger in public and i wasnt expecting to just become friends with her like that or anything but i still feel like i was such an awkward fuck god i miss having girl friends to talk to about anime and go to cons together with and stuff
  thank you anon thats a really wholesome post it made me smile and try to look at things differently not saying it changed my life but your study hard comment motivated me to get off the couch and work on a paper ive been putting off thank you       probably im on antidepressants but im wondering if i need a higher dose ill have to talk to my doctor about that
i hope i can get married some day
  to who anon im curious
  we probably havent met yet
  are they a cute girl
  dont let me be your motivation you have a few more years of this that you need to use your discipline to make it through motivation is easy to draw on it can even be spontaneous and fleeting discipline is reliable  that being said im glad i was able to make you move just internalize what i said and let it keep driving you
  yes this would be nice
  same  i wish i could get this whole loving yourself thing down so i can love someone else without them telling me i need to love myself first
  thats the idea
would anyone like to watch some rider
  no
  oh well ok then
  ive never watched it before is it good
  dpends on which rider season personally id start off with ex aid and build but you can cchoose w/e
  i feel dead inside  i can relate to this feeling in a nonmeme way took me a couple of years and a few sessions at my unis psychological counselor to find out that i dont have real goals in life beyond a few smaller shortterm changes while my lifes circumstances werent the absolute worst there were still a bunch of things weighing heavily on my mind and as it turned out later apparently big enough to start a cascade negativity that eventually pulled me down all the way to the bottom its the absolute worst feeling when you cant really find joy in anything you do in life and i mean literally anything and just live on from day to day being incredibly bored of everything being so energyless that you cant even get the initiative to do basic daily tasks i fucked up my hs diploma because of that and also got stuck in uni unable to achieve any real progress its gotten slightly better when i recently figured out which things are responsible for amplifying this feeling of emptiness so i can atleast muster up some strength for little changes but im still far away from full recovery    also seconding  try to give yourself some time and go deep inside your mind are there any things that are bothering you any burdens something you deeply miss or wish would be different did you feel stressed out recently or had any changes in your diet etc
  this anon has it right the restriction isnt nonsensical or anything    anyway i do love helping people but dont know if i love the work yet so well see i just figured id have better chances in aged care than something like childcare because im a guy and as everyone knows all men who would willingly choose to care for children are secret pedophiles
  rightbest feels thread ever      i would anon ive never watched any though id be interested in the funniest one tho
  best feels thread ever  ive never watched any though  what

  im glad somebody got it so quickly  wizard my main
  memphis
    im an anon who likes masked characters/object heads ive always seen and admired krs outfits from afar but i never actually sat down to watch the show im also really glad this thread became a thing because its never really this good a thread in general desu
  im happy for you anon some progress is better than no progress i hope you continue to get better     there were still a bunch of things weighing heavily on my mind and as it turned out later apparently big enough to start a cascade negativity that eventually pulled me down all the way to the bottom  wow you hit the nail on the head thats exactly thats going on with me i have a ton of things that are bugging me which would mean a ton of seperate therapy sessions and i cant afford that my uni does offer students 5 free therapy sessions per semester but the uni therapist i got paired with was a turd     when you were dealing with this did it work to tackle one issue at a time or did you talk about everything at once with your therapist thanks again
  id still make you my wizard loving gf  but i wouldnt tell my friends      oof
  ok we can still watch with you anon drop your disc
  i would never date someone who doesnt think wizard is cool 
  spoiler i havent finished wizard desu i need a reason to watch it since i didnt like it alone spoiler     you should be my wizard gf anyway 
  i hate this fucking website

cringe
all my friends no longer want to go to cons i found out when i asked them about ax plans most of them said theyre too old for it were 26 years old is that really too old
  age is irrelevant theyve probably just matured before you
rider anons where are you lets watch some shows
  link rabbit
  dopping it      
im so fucking sick of all the males coming to this board not reading the rules and making a thread all about people spoonfeeding them information are you scrotes so fucking entitled and dense you cant spend like 5 seconds clicking open the catalog and ctrf a proper thread why do you keep coming here and asking for advice on how to make your attention whoring malethot costume or agp fetish crossdress suit instead of using the help or crossplay thread it happens every goddamn day and im growing tired of it
  its the nature of the internet and 4chan in general its not your super special secret club woman
  screech harder /r9k/chan
  im sorry you have to deal with this i do apologize on behalf of male posters thats disadvantage of anonymous board one retarded faggot is sufficient to shit up the tread making you think all the anons are that dumb    t male cosplayer
  you forgot to tip your fedora at the end and refer to her as mlady faggotkun
this is a rider thread anons it is meant for kindness just chill and love each other
  holy shit is she okay
tfw in love with a girl from the other side of the world  tfw we would do cute jfashion twinning and couple cosplays
wake up dont even get to eat just get ready and have maybe 5 minutes to myself  commute to work takes 2 hours  work 8 hours  commute home takes 225 hours  shower eat whatever i have first and only meal of day at 7 pm  at most an hour to myself before bed time because my body wants 9 hours of sleep  repeat  is this life even after all that it barely covers my bills    scrotes  anon i love you
  dont work at a nuclear power plant
  this    oregano
    i dont understand that reference
  go get a sugar partner lad
  excuse me what
  im pretty sure that post was taking the piss
  thats great and all but more importantly why did you choose an elf to represent girls
  i guess anon at this point im not gonna get a date
  i would call her little either she appears to be rather tall
i hate every trans lolita get out of my fashion you fetishist     brolitas are on thin ice but theyre not much better
  theyre either insecure or just dont have the guts to say they have no interest anymore
  honestly the enablers are even worse
  its not bait i just hate them
  correct love only in this thread
  i hate the fakebois that dress up in lolita and constantly remind everyone that theyre actually male
i hope this is ontopic enough but the huge influx of crossboarders and bait threads/replies since this domain change is so annoying and i dont know why people are replying instead of just reporting so we can actually keep this board functional and useful   a lot of the threads here are really useful and seeing people intentionally letting others shit it up and derail threads is really disheartening can we all agree to be more diligent in ignoring these posts theres no other forum quite like this for talking about egl and cosplay but thats not my thing and i dont want to see it go down the shitter any more than it has
  thanks im new i will report them from now on
  i dont see how the domain change would impact anything
    looks like some of the garbage were receiving are from other boards and the trash has brought along its flies       /r9k/chan
  good to hear also welcome      i didnt think it would either but it seemed to start happening around the same time i dont know if the separation of nsfw boards might have had anything to do with it i could be completely wrong but its definitely been happening more lately regardless
  can you move closer to your job if so do that
  t gookmoot
woke up late and comfy   house is neat because i vacuumed yesterday   pair of meta socks i bought over a month ago arrived   played pokemon lets go with partner biked to post office   sent out a gift for a secret santa and a dress i sold  now chilling in my burando coat and leggings while partner cooks and sings in the kitchen  im still depressed and live my life in a constant state of nonspecific annoyance but im having a cozy day and it feels good i hope youre having a good day too anons
  this is nice and wholesome good for you anon
i wish i could forcefully move these retarded girls to /r9k/
  this was so nice to read im glad for you anon
  yeah careful with that ive been working in senior care since college and unless youre trained medical or a manager never handle transferring residents quick way to fuck up everyones day on the bright side i hope you enjoy the massive red pill that is seniorcare    to keep on topic im just having a hard time meeting women who will even tolerate the things i enjoy i have my two best friends who dont go out the gym and the game store where i go to play tabletop i know i dont need a woman who shares my interests and honestly im not so sure a relationship would be so great right now havent been involved with cons in any meaningful fashion since 2016 my mom surprised me with a matchcom account she made and paid for which is kind of cute but its such a shit show
  with the domain change a lot of people from reddit tumblr resetera and twitter all have this thought that /pol/ /b/ and /r9k/ are permanent gone which is why a lot of boards are flooding with newfags
  source my ass
  from the way some gulls act to me it seems that these places have invaded a long time ago i mean look at this  shit
  i was originally a crossboarder but i stuck around cuz i sew/make and wear cosplay and theres no other board that does it    honestly /cgl/ is such a cesspool of thirsty xboard fucks pointless drama and epeen stroking its a little sickening the cosplay part of it is really small and most of that part is just attention whoring how do i get moar subscribers and betabux also like 3/4ths of the board needs mental help    wish there were a lot more progress threads and a bigger presence of cosu creation desu i know theres a lot of lurkers that create but they just dont post
  as a cosplayer i dont post except to advice threads or sharing photos i like because i dont want to selfpost and be identified i should probably get over it at some point but im not really in a hurry to
  retard
  ayrt here    when you were dealing with this did it work to tackle one issue at a time or did you talk about everything at once with your therapist thanks again    i went to the therapist for slightly less than a year usually one session per month during the first 23 sessions i basically just dumped almost everything that was keeping my mind busy during the initial phase we worked out a plan to set priorities for problems and slowly talked through each of them while also considering my recent wellbeing changes in mood and feelings talking about applied strategies and how they worked out etc he mostly relied on a selfawareness kind of strategy to help me out understanding my own thoughts better which worked fine for me after a year i stopped going there though since i felt it requires some time first to apply changes and see results continuing going there would have been like walking in circles but ironically this exact thought just confirmed that i have no direction in life and just try to run away from being confronted with reality    this was about 3 years ago cant really say going there magically changed my life but it sure helped getting an understanding of my own thought process and finding the flaws and inconsistencies of it    i hope you will soon find your way out anon
ordered a skirt from iw a week ago  still no email regarding payment  have several times before heard of people getting banned from iw because of them not paying their items   even though they didnt get any contact from iw except for the automated confirmation mail starting to get nervous    its been years since i last bought directly from them so i dont remember how long it usually takes
approached by french lolitas to participate as a vendor in modern doll fest  aam i big time now
  yes anon you made it whats your store and when is modern doll fest so i can go buy your things

tfw you wanna talk to someone at a con but you absolutely cant think of anything worth saying to them so just stare awkwardly from a distance for a short while and walk off
  heavy fucking breathing your stuff is bomb
  you made me hungry so thats the sauce on the chicken stir fry im making
wait 2 hours after class to show up to cosplay club meeting first time hearing about it  they dont have a meeting that day and didnt update any of their social media
  sounds yummy
  this is a constant feeling anon also good blade reference
  men crossboarders and anime interspersed with general feels
why are the sexual crossdressers always so gross looking i wouldnt mind seeing cute twinks running around the con in a seifuku or a maid outfit but its always fat hairy incels or disgusting old men
  or greasy dallas buyers club lookin aids skeletons
  because a fat or buff hairy guy doing it is not taken seriously and is therefore supposedly not creepy
  shes alive but shes going to be almost completely blind at best
  oregano  go back to r9k  back to where u belong incel
  this is a rider chat lad bring it back about 1020
  kamen rider is awful and you should feel embarrassed for liking it

sometimes i wonder how many posters in these threads have legitimate mental disabilities    tfw no mentally disabled bf/gf
  probably quite a few considering where we are
  it would explain a lot
  idk my shrink has asked me multiple times if i was ever diagnosed with autism as a kid so i guess i show some symptoms of it  does that count
am i an evil person if i buy a cosplay prop carry it around the con and then return it to walmart
  no fuck walmart

  iktf  promised self i wouldnt commit suicideat 11  godawful childhood abusive parents social isolation most schoolmates thought i was literally a mute because i never spoke to anyone  extremely disfunctional by college age  worked hard to build self from ground up so i could survive no parents or friends to fall back on and born into poverty  series of fuckups poverty job loss failure to get a job and other problems  kept working on self  massive confidence gains improved self all around wouldnt even believe im the same person  now a bloomer and only mildly want to kms every second of the day  down to goal weight and maintaining if not still losing because i hardly eat  long since deleted all social media am a ghost by choice  sink or swim     worthless  shoo shoo back to /incel/ you go

  im a bad person i did this at target target
    thank you for responding it makes me feel better to hear someone has gone through something very similar makes me feel less like an isolated weirdo at work id feel weird when coworkers would ask me my holiday plans or about my family i learned to redirect the topic to them and just ask questions about their lives but it just made me feel like a weird alien its a rough week but just have to keep up with the weight loss and taking my meds and hope maybe this time round 13 of changing my medication will help again thank you for taking the time to respond
  your mom sounds so sweet    /cgl/ related  my mom keeps mentioning how i should get a respectable bf because her only comparison right now is the gamer that my sister is dating he supports her cosplay habit but the whole family hates him she just deserves better siblings are rough
  np anon check out /fast/ for weight loss did the trick for me feels bad that i lost years of my life because my parents were human garbage as well as my entire childhood being a living hell i hope not to remember but after you go through a hell like that and survive you can survive anything you have a type of inner strength most people could never achieve     just report and hide that anon is just assmad that not even an 80 year old grandmother would let him lick her cunt much less stick his dick in rip anon will never score in this life or any other

    consider yourselves lucky that your parents still have hope my parents realized a few years ago that both myself and my sister are genetic dead ends and just stopped mentioning relationships altogether unfortunately the extended family hasnt gotten the memo yet so they still ask me about getting a gf every now and again and it reminds me that ill never know what romantic love is      go give you mom a hug right now

  reading this post is really funny if you actually know pyramid head
  what is this wizardry   bulimia
  mostly other clothes that i dont wear anymore  i have a bad habit of only wearing things once or twice and since im basically a clothes hoarder i still had all my cute kid clothes and grandmas love ebay so i cleaned up pretty well lol      i highly recommend looking at thrift store for things you sell on ebay since everyone has computers on them now its super easy to go how much does a happy bunny shirt from 2005 sell for find out and then see if its worth reselling
i was at my local post office this week to pick up a lacemarket purchase and shit was packed i wasnt in a hurry so i didnt mind being twenty numbers away in the queue you can glance into the postrooms from the reception and the abundance of boxes was just unreal    i cant help but feel a bit guilty when i send another order for christmas presents off over the internet im trying to find solace in that my bf will really love and cherish these shirts hes got two like them already and theyre his favourite so here comes four more    no a globalised order for four shirts over the ocean still feels dumb at least on lacemarket i can filter to only buy from other european sellers why does all cool stores have to be on the other side of the world
  yeah hes a pretty cool guy
  being a short girl and wanting to cosplay a kamen rider is sad times  also never having made armour shit and being afraid to fuck it up  guess ill stick to cosplaying the characters in their casual clothes and still looking like shit cause i look nothing like the actors
  a character just for us
  armor isnt that hard just gotta go for it
  those welds are pretty nice
  brazed them with a torch went alright until i started bending all the teeth down and some spots started separating
took me three attempts so far to draft a simple shirt pattern for a cosplay  this was supposed to be the easy part    man i know i havent drafted in a while but didnt think id be this rusty this sucks ass didnt think i needed my pattern stash so i didnt bring it from home
  im also suicidal want to be online friends maybe we can get along and  try to find goodness somewhere if youre interested slip me a throwaway email seriously im struggling and could use some friends
really hate my job just despise working in general  really want to travel and cant afford to and dont have paid vacation leave no benefits at all  think every day about selling myself to some rich old guy as a bride so i wont have to work anymore  just cant go through with it  life wasnt supposed to be like this     teeth actually do shift more than most people think mine pop and shift a bit and i notice it freaked me out at first idk i live in terror every day but you get used to it   i had a terrible reaction to some hot cocoa today i have a 3tooth crown called bridge and despite drinking hot tea all the time i took a sip and pain that was some 7/10 pain only lasted a few seconds but it freaked me out took some hot shower water into my mouth to replicate it also pain but lower extent fuck teeth ill probably end up killing myself over dental pain/terror sometime in the future
  blame feminism and both world wars

  im doing pretty great no big dramas at work and we had some fun moments like marriage coming up as a topic of conversation one of the old ladies asking me if i was married all the others teasing her for flirting with a guy young enough to be her grandson until she got really embarrassed and started blushing and then her husband comes over and joins in by joking about how hell have to spank her for being naughty

  nayrt but depoprovera  if you arent needle phobic its a 4x per year commitment for no more blood
  blackface and black face paint are two separate entities you have no control over people who are willing to claim that any charcoal tone is blackface but if youre that worried go with steel grey or something
  not for u bc u hate wizard
  young japanese mothers love kamen rider fujoshi too    imo emu is the cutest mc but he felt really neglected and took a back seat to the other exaid characters so his writing is kind of really flat
  my life is empty and anime lost its magic for me a friend of mine is trying to make me watch kamen rider but i cant quite see the appeal please give me honest reasons why its fun to watch it
finally building up my wardrobe  have very eclectic taste in lolita  love sweet   love gothic   keep buying pastel dresses but only ever have black shoes/accessories   none of my headbows match my dresses   why the fuck did i buy a purple blouse nothing else in my lolita wardrobe is purple
  just watch one  then a few  its funny
  anon are you me
my sister scammed me out of 40 and i want her to die
  can you get those money back some way
have a wardrobe of brand  spent a lot of money and effort building it  had a uniform so couldnt wear it on weekdays  spent weekends studying at the public library generally looking like a slob  can finally wear lolita whenever i like  extremely selfconscious at the thought  wears lolita around the house  the fabrics and trims are all beautiful but i dont like up to their beauty  im searching for that balance between a good lolita coord and a coord that is easy to wear i guess most of my main pieces are jsks so maybe thats why im focusing more on ops now i had to keep my hair as a bob until recently and im now growing my hair out so maybe itll look better    i love this fashion i love the aesthetic and the details when i look at lolitas in the wild i dont even bat an eyelid at their clothes but when it comes to me somehow the same clothes look so foreign
bumping on /cgl/
  bumping on /cgl/ after less than 14 minutes
  i have yet to see a brolita/trans lolita who isnt horribly misogynistic and a complete lucky bag of gross fetishes some sensible twinky dude might do it once as an experiment and not be a disgusting piece of sissy shit but they cant be counted as brolitas really   im 6ft2 gonna buy this fetish gear satin gothic lolita dress for 20 bucks wear my ratty greasy hair on pigtails and get the 2 aliexpress cat sock stockings you terf bitches have to respect my freedom to be a part of this fashion reeee suck my girldick
  balance between a good lolita coord and a coord that is easy to wear  without knowing what your wardrobe is like  keep it simple that basic bitch combination of blouse and socks matching the lace color on the jsk and the shoes and purse matching the main color of the main piece is super basic but is also difficult to fuck up youd have to try to look bad to mess it up its a no brainer way to coord but if you want to make the fashion wearable you have to do away with fussing over itty bitty tiny details like one would do with ott coords ops do admittedly make coording even more simple because they do most of the work for you you just have to accessorize nicely and that doesnt mean going flashy either mind you i love the look of blouses and jsks but i have many more ops than jsks because as a daily lolita theyre just that much easier to wear and head out the door   short hair can look adorable in lolita if your hair has any volume to it it can support the look of bigger bows with minimal effort but if that doesnt work for you then small bows are ok too    you do have some things to figure out by the sound of it but its perfectly doable dont let anyone convince you that you have to wear 3 petticoats and a wig to look presentable
  wait wizardchan is that you if we keep meeting up like i might ask you out on a rider date      would you like to watch build with me i have already seen it but it is a wonderful show and i recommend it to anyone just starting off with rider
  if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself
  not that anon but temporarysubmarinegmailcom  i could also use a friend
bunch of gulls wanna watch anime  none of it is anime i know  feelsbad

tfw your friends super hot sister is only 17 i got so depressed that i ate 30 chicken nuggets
  i heard coffee meets bagel is what the hip 20 somethings are using cons are such a shitshow there just isnt a good way to meet people other than through friends work or school

  deno and ooo were my entry to kamen rider excellent tastes op
tfw no yellow ranger gf
  tfw no yellow ranger  rip thuy trang
  my first waifu
    yellow  not pink
  thank you for the advice kind anon ill keep trying
  i keep cheese and crackers in my house
  nayrt but also like an extra 4060lbs heavier yeah not
  my homie
  yes
  it depends on the person    my cousin was quite popular in school and banged a couple hot guys in her teens before realising she wasnt actually enjoying being with them and loved women
  it always helped me get over that thought by reminding myself that i have standards most people just settle for anything that looks in their general direction especially in niche hobbies its so worth waiting until you really click with that perfect person
  i actually go through similar because of medication im taking im often too focused on other stuff to remember to eat till the end of the day and its a crappy feeling once it finally hits but ive found going ahead and eating once nauseous can really help especially crackers or something starchy
tfw you realize youll never have another human being find you genuinely attractive  tfw you realize youll never be desired by anyone  tfw you realize you missed your chance to find mr right while young and cute and now youre ugly and pathetic and have too much emotional baggage     late night drunk feels are really hitting me hard i just hate myself and i hate my life and it really hurts
  anon are you alright do you want to talk
  im sure someone will find you attractive once you lose the weight you can do it anon
  if 90yo grandmas can get it on in retirement homes its a cause never truly lost so dont give up just yet everyone has doubts and insecurities sometimes find someone to talk to im sure youll find love eventually if you keep looking work on yourself build up confidence thats attractive
  you sound like youre still pretty young my guess is 2024     anyway i think youre too deep in the chan culture with its obsession with young virginal girls young men are a mess and its not that great to date them anyway the mr right you wouldve met at 22 probably wouldve turned out to be a complete asshole its way better to date people when youre 30 and have life figured out better you dont turn into a dusty mummy the moment you hit 29 a lot of women stay beautiful and youthful looking up to their 40s these days
  young man here 22 i agree    then again im into girls who are 410 years older than me so take my opinion with a grain of salt
  take it from someone who was engaged to be married at 18 and had that fall apart before i was 19 to the point we never saw each other again youre going to be fine    young love most of the time ends in disaster or unhappy marriages being older just means you know what you want and youre not willing to settle just because someone comes along and shows you attention for 5 minutes    if you really want to meet guys try a reputable dating website something like match where they at least try to set you up with someone compatible rather than swiping off a picture    youll find someone anon but until then work on yourself and realize you dont need a man to determine your selfworth/attractiveness
not a /cgl/ feel but here we go     boyfriend has been really busy hasnt been able to make much time for me feels like i do all the work situation unlikely to change   decided to take a break to work out what i want/if the stress is worth it and to sort myself out a bit   week and a half later have sunk into a deep depression havent been this low for years   no idea what i want to do wrt the relationship cant tell if i miss him or not because everythings foggy   cry whenever i think too hard about it   cant feel sad if you cant feel anything   saw a therapist and he said he couldnt help me because im too messed up is apparently trying to find me someone else but havent heard anything yet said hed be in touch on thursday   day when i see my boyfriend again is getting closer and i feel like i havent made any progress on sorting my life out or working out what to do   have spent the last three days in bed being a piece of shit and playing age of mythology instead of studying    dont date anyone gulls its not worth it
  saw a therapist and he said he couldnt help me because im too messed up    wait what
  sounds like you got a dependency issue
tfw cant be with perfect canadian exescort heroin using in open relationship with her current bf girl
   i fail to see the issue  is the sex good do you like spending time with him are you compatible lifestylewise would you want to maybe have kids with him yes/no if not date someone else if yes go talk to him and stop playing dumb ass games what the fuck do you want a therapist to do they cant tell you whether you like the guy or not youre trying to outsource your decisions to a therapist daddysubstitute so you dont have to make them yourself thats why the therapist blew you off you arent too messed up its just a wad of bullshit like a surgeon turning down some woman with hyperchondriasis who insists she needs her lungs amputated
  he said that i have too many unresolved issues and he cant make the commitment needed to help me right now i assume that therapists have to be careful about who they take on otherwise they can burn out      yeah thats been a running theme in my life thats why im trying to get therapy
  ah yeah that makes sense at least hell find you someone that can commit to helping you out longterm which is what it sounds like is the issue he may not have the necessary gaps in his patients to fit another longterm patient
need to have apartment magazine quality clean by tomorrow  all i managed so far was to fold my laundry  lord kill me i have papers all over the place is the biggest issue my god its 2018 and i still get paper mail just kill me i want to throw all my possessions in the dumpster so its finally clean once and for all god why

new larp thread for all the shittalking and for the occasional larp stuff    previous thread  
  flat armored feminist smashing the patriarchy ca 2018 colorized
  2018  assuming things  shiggitydiggity
  implying you wouldnt like to have your patriarchy smashed by a woman like this
   you wouldnt like to have your patriarchy smashed by a woman like this    nothing would make me more happy than that desu  tfw no larp gf
  too bad shes taken
  why my armour waifu is superior
repost from last thread    picked up a footlocker/steamer at local thrift store for 15 no lock but i can get a replacement for the same amount any ideas on dressing up the outside ive been working on a traveling merchant kit and would love to be able to have ic luggage
  to perfect to be real      dont go around rubbing in peoples crushed dreams please this is a nice general
  powerful chin up defiant confident    looks like an abuse victim lmao
  please dont buy stuff if you dont already know what/how to work on it    i dont personally see how that is supposed to be converted to be ic approvable i also dont know what setting/character style you are going for  if its high fantasy maybe paint the metal pieces in bronze/gold/darkened bronze color and replace the whole hinges with something that looks handmade then cover the base parts with some oriental style tapestry or some sort  i dont know really it would probably be easier to build something from scratch with proper materials and get a better result what do you have in mind
  i dont really have a larp that i attend only decient larp near me is steam/magipunk that being said id love to find a mid fantasy larp but that will likely have to wait until i can afford moving i did have some ideas before buying it but wanted to let the lovely people give input
      s/lovely people give/lovely people here give    since your partly blind i say it again traveling elven merchant most of my kit will end up being greens and browns with some nickel/silver accents
  how about you fuck off
  everybody has to suffer like i do
thoughts regarding short parlor larps at conventions
  what exactly constitutes a parlor larp    im currently writing two larps myself one is a three hour long larp for five players which im writing on my own the other is about five hours long for forty players and written by a team of three im quite willing to share my experience with those if anyones interested    larps that take about an afternoon or an evening are great i much prefer them over tabletop roleplaying sessions of similar length the main problem is that short larps need much more preparation than ttrpg sessions of the same length    however i get the feeling youre talking about larps which take about an hour at most in an almost escape roomlike setup which i have less experience with
  id prefere that you the nobody instead did that just because ive been lurking more than talking recently doesnt mean that i havent contributed my fair share     w/o heavy makeup it would be hard to cover my medically abnormally fair skin a dermatologist said that and then that they had seen everything and now could retire thus i larp as fair folk
  parlor larp refers to a larps which is contained to a single room typically without fighting vampire the masquerade often is run as a parlor larp for example typically sub 30 people and typically last for at most a couple hours
  parlor larps are fun recruiting folks from conventions im more worried about what kind of convention are we talking about got any specific examples of this kind of thing being done      stop trying to score big boy points on 4chan
  im submitting to a jersey gaming convention in the summer the kind where table games are signed up for first day of con or months before the event a smattering of short larps that will go on the con schedule    there will be other larps there scifi and fantasy and all things between so folks should have enough on hand to suitcase costume for an unexpected game of any genre
  i honestly dont give a rats arse what you think of me name is only there to help with flow if i was trying to earn points id add the trip i use to use forever ago back people here are fairly cool though so no need
are zippers on the sides of boots an immersionbreaker    i want to make a good impression when i go to this larp in my area so i want a good costume generic medieval fantasy im looking for shoes in the thrift store but anything i find that might be good tends to have a big zipper along the side
   name is only there to help with flow  this fuck i swear plenty of imageboards and threads work just fine when everyone is an anonymous your posts and contributions dont do jack to help it out youre no hungarian hell you arent even gropey  if i was trying to earn points id add the trip i use to use forever ago back  still namefagging namefag
  just because you havent seen my contributions doesnt mean they arent there couple years ago it was basically me gropalope and hungarian keeping these threads alive ask them and they will remember me    on another note anyone heard from larpsocks recently
  couple years ago it was basically me gropalope and hungarian keeping these threads alive ask them and they will remember me  wow you sure think youre hot shit dont you
  honestly who gives a fuck  3 dudes circle jerking isnt a good thread to have if it dies it dies    name fagging isnt good basically ever you are all gropey wannabes not realizing hes a massive turd as well
had a possibly good idea of buying a second hand but still good quality golf caddy bag for the transporting and storage of larp weapons
  possibly good idea    what about two handed swords and axes
  its fine assuming you dont have any short weapons a childs gold bag might be the best      those would fit best
  wildling waifu cutest waifu
  i dont know what kind of weapons you have but in general its not a good idea to store a lot of weapons together i know someone who kept about a dozen weapons epic armoury and palnatoke mostly in a bag together and they kind of melted together he had to throw away some of them in the end      you have a lot of leeway when it comes to shoes in larp most people wear normal modern shoes or army boots anyway as long as its not too eyecatching a zipper should be fine      so youre planning on writing and running one in that case let me give you some random thoughts and advice from my own experience    writing a larp like this as opposed to writing a ttrpg requires a bottomtotop approach instead of starting with an idea and fleshing it out you want to start by considering the medium and its options and limitations how much room do you have what timespan will the room be private to your larp or will there also be others is the room large enough to have several private conversations in or is everything centered around a single table these things should determine your high concept     the way i see it you can take these things in three general directions problemsolving drama or pvp pvp works best if youre playing a metalarp where the entire con is used as the game location i think hungarian did something like that a while back but on an even bigger scale    the difference between problemsolving and drama comes from the dispositions between characters if characters are welldisposed towards one another they will attempt to solve the plot fairly efficiently this makes the game more puzzlelike the disadvantage is that it requires a lot of props and preparation the alternative is drama drama requires much less preparation as its almost only about the characters and not the environment the problem is that not all players can play drama properly    if you have a solid idea i can give more specifc advice
  are zippers on the sides of boots an immersionbreaker  only for autists  but if you want to you can cover the zippers with a strip of fabric or leather because while zippers arent immersion breaking they arent the best looking stuff either and you can easily cover them up
  writing a larp like this as opposed to writing a ttrpg requires a bottomtotop approach instead of starting with an idea and fleshing it out you want to start by considering the medium and its options and limitations how much room do you have what timespan will the room be private to your larp or will there also be others is the room large enough to have several private conversations in or is everything centered around a single table these things should determine your high concept  technically speaking thats how you should start most larp planning not just these parlor larps which are as far as i gather are basically chamber larps and there are tons of info about them on the net if you search with that term
  what are those style of clothing called
  the ones that the witcher videogames has kind of like 16th century german clothing with a mix of fantasy
  the nobody  jesus man i know you as a namefag but youve done nothing interesting to talk like that cant recall your kit or your knowledge but if youre buying shit like this im pretty sure it cant be anything interesting      first one sounds like a parlour larp in my knowledge parlour larps are smaller larps usually with a vague hint of nordic played inside one or few rooms and focussed on the less combat and culture based aspects of larp and more on social interactions politics and the likes      if it can be avoided no zippers if youre a beginning fantasy larper/student go for it youll replace em in a year or two but shoes arent the most important part of your costume so dont be afraid to cheat a little on that       theyre absolutely trending right now as well expecting to see a fuckton in this style in the near future after finishing my tellerbaret and wamse i was thinking of starting on a doublet in that style as well       do you have the possibility of getting a small roster of actors to help you if so you could set it up as more of a reallife game which is far more normie friendly i work as an actor for a reallife game and just finished helping a student interactive art design a game with a budget of 100 euros    actors if working for free can do everything you need them to to carry a game if interaction immersion and difficulty scaling are the things you want go for an acting heavy roster otherwise you could opt for more of a puzzle based escape room although neither really come close to larping they can be the leeway normies might need to be activated to start larping since there is a lot of room for them to try it out
  3      i honestly dont know who you are bro     as for larpsocks we talk often on facebook and hes doing excellent just busy with life and work like most of us    random pic
    those guys were from the imperium camp at epic empires so theyre heavily inspired by the empire from warhammer like hlf said its basically 30 years war fantasy hre
      any clue where i can buy those type of clothing i check google etsy and other places but couldnt find anything i need it i want it i just wanna walk around my town call people peasants and challenge them to a duel please make my dream come true
  those specific cloths were hand made you have to order it specificly from someone or just look at mytholon for some lower quality not so good looking stuff that somehow resemble it from afar at night if you are blind
    hand made  my technique is just asking people at larp who are well dressed where they got it made  in most of my games one or two people kit most of the good hand made costumes
  gotta make them yourself like the rest of us or get a costume designer gf like a friend of mine did
    look at my anonymity you must be like me only the anonymous will survive
  you might have been able to have remembered kit that i have if i did have a kit but i have never said or implied that i have a kit together just that i was working on one like litterly my entire kit atm is the footlocker that something needs done to and a pair of prosthetic ears that you think i have a kit just makes you look bad
      where do you guys get your fabric tutorial   you tell me there is something out there i cant buy  i dont wanna larp i wanna wear it casually as i stroll around town and kick peasants out of my way
  fabric from this egyptian guy who runs a store and sells fabric cheap  tutorials online by googling whatever i want to make or buying patterns in store
  i get my wool from a local guy who goes to eastern europe every once in a while and my damask and satins from poland linnen i just get locally from random shops      so you act all high and mighty dont have a kit and then still have the guts to pretend youre a big shot on a cantonese image board  youre the biggest waste of tripspace ive ever seen mate
  like litterly my entire kit atm is the footlocker that something needs done to and a pair of prosthetic ears  he hasnt even attended a larp once for the most basic shit  and he still considers himself one of the greats  this isnt isnt your regular retard its advanced retard
  where do you guys get your fabric tutorial  fabric is random guys that i know and stoffede but basically im constantly in look for proper fabric as most of them here is shit or overpriced as fuck linen is doable to find but for wool if i want specific colors or even unpainted one i have to search really hard if i want 100 ones and not pay an arm and a leg    you tell me there is something out there i cant buy  anon there are things that money cant buy for example the two guys mother that arguing who is more important they cant be bought because they are free and everyone knows that
  i go to a local store or order things online tutorials can also be found online especially on youtube but i mostly improvise
how does one get into larping  and how does combat work and everything
  how does one get into larping  basically you go to an event while fulfill any requirements that event has be it entrance fee or costume standards etc and thats it  you can be recruited by friends or whatever maybe you were brought in for npc stuff doesnt really matter basically you go to an event and play mileage may vary depending on specific events    and how does combat work and everything  if i want to be very vague so it will be true for most game then basically you have to hit or touch the other guy with your weapon that is mostly padded for safety you might have to touch/hit him several times while avoiding the other guy doing the same   obviously this is an oversimplified stuff be there are hundreds of different rules for combat so a lot of them works in a different way some doesnt allow stabbing some has magic some has bows some prefer harder hitting some prefer lightest touch some allow grappling some doesnt the list goes on
  how does one get into larping  took a stroll through the forest with my parents when i was like 6 years old came over a bunch of grown ups in really cool costumes that were roleplaying on a clearing one of them gave me his sword and told me to hit the woman next to him    got a tunic belt and a foam weapon on my next birthday those three things are a good base to get started maybe some pants too just make sure to keep expanding your kit and roleplaying skills
  oh hi knigga long time no see
  ask them and they will remember me    i honestly dont know who you are   poetry
  truth to be told i remember him but i would rather read as people shittalk each others waifu than this dick contest that comes up every fucking time when someone puts up a name and isnt immediately sucking everyones dick
  when has he pretended hes a big shot    honest question dude just asked for some advice and yall are chimping out because he used a name in the one thread on the site where names are seminormal the hell
  and how does combat work and everything  the same way sports work that is to say different in every game to the point that youd need to ask about a specific game to get a meaningful answer
he wears monks strap dress shoes for his larp outfit  black sneakers wouldve been better pal
  wouldnt say names are seminormal and if thats the fact id call the usual chimpout even more of a tradition the convo between the two started of nice and then he repeated a part a bit rudely most likely because his idea was shot down by anon and then bobs your uncle we got a flame war on our hands pity is he acted like a dick with a name    id prefere that you the nobody instead did that just because ive been lurking more than talking recently doesnt mean that i havent contributed my fair share    if i was trying to earn points id add the trip i use to use forever ago back    since your partly blind i say it again   is the part where this all started      you could check bors larpprops he sells costumes
  thats what happens all the time  it would be even worse if he would oppose gropey in some form then suddenly we would have 20 random anons who didnt contributed to the threads at all throwing shit at him
no viking qt will ever look at me like this
  dont settle for a viking qt anon especially when for most people being a viking is just a passing whim
  why have vikings if you can have a damsel  also the larp that picture is from had some really good shots fucking loved the orcs on that one      if only larp would be better off with a tad less basic vikings and a bit more eastern or southern cultures
  well the vikingboos come and go though their population is kind of constant and obviously sometimes you find people who are serious about being retarded or in extreme cases actually good at pulling off the viking stuff but those are the exceptions in a sea of shit
    it would be the same with whatever history fad people latch onto vikings just have the misfortune of another burst of popularity building on decades of shit am i selfish for wanting the next sensation to be period i dont do
  true but vikings are the current fad so its easy and convenient to hate them  i fear the time when someone will make a shit tier series about landsknechts and there will be even more random fanboys who get all their info from that
  larp would be better off with a tad less basic vikings and a bit more eastern or southern cultures  only if the people playing them know what theyre doing there are far too many cringeworthy characters out there that do it terrible
  you mean you are not pumped for the inevitable netflix original paul dolnstein adventures
  i doesnt even have netflix but if anyone would make something like that i would hope for a hbo mini series like band of brothers or generation kill
  history channel you get the full vikings treatment
  if that happens im joining isis and start bombing people properly and efficiently
  its not like landsknechte havent already reached meme fanboy tier in larp
  thats true but its still a lightyear away from the viking fanboys who think that they are vikings even in real life when all they have is some shitty bedsheet and grandmas furniture cover
  the costumes usually are a lot better vikings are easy to step in hard to master fuck the hand embroidry man it makes me want to kill myself when i have to work on a new tunic    but the basic of birka pants and a birka tunic with if youre a cool guy a birka hat and a hedeby kaftan well any old square can do that  mainly because its pretty much squares rectangles and the small triangle for a gore
  wouldnt say names are seminormal  they literally are though some of the namefags have disappeared but identifying oneself with a name has still been a larpthread tradition for years to give others context for where we larp hence hungarian frenadian or what characters we play tarantula elf it helps ensure that we dont have to repeat a boilerplate list of our experience and location whenever we ask/give advice    he started it because he responded rudely  ask for ideas and get told to fuck off  bruh      dont summon him you fool
  the fuck off came after when i said it started and whining about namefags has still been a classic thing never you mind when there is no reason to be a namefag    the list of things you listed might be useful if it was at all relevant to him but he doesnt even have a kit besides a lockerbox and a set of elf ears  look at this point im getting kinda tired of just having a yes  no about namefagging though so so im going to stop responding after this if you dont mind itll most likely just be more of the same nagging    speaking of more of the same nagging whats everybody making right now currently working on a schlappe and tellerbaret for a fancy dress party this weekend
  speaking of more of the same nagging whats everybody making right now  i have to make a new lk outfit but right now my biggest concern is moving to a new apartment so that takes priority and all the money  but in my imaginary list there is also a hand pavese and may or may not stepping up the cock and swallow flag with another generation
would you tell me larp thread of the feels cringe and drama of your comms if you feel comfortable doing so need to vent or think it would be fun
  there are a shitton of drama and cringe around here as with most places i presume but the problem is the larp scene is relatively small so it gets very specific and sometimes needs a lot of background history to be understood
  if it needs context and youre willing to provide please go ahead and dump a text wall
  well most of the things arent really new no great shitstorm happened in the past few months that i can recall there are some minor things that either not really interesting/fun like people getting angry at other people for putting an event on the wrong date and stuff like that or the other kind of perpetual stuff is how some people are just generally a shitwaffle / being retarded but those are usually not really larp related    though there was a case this year when a game organizer tried to ban someone from a game because he was allegedly sexually harassed some of her friends and to this they i only have third hand stories about what allegedly happened and even those are barely nothing but the plot twist was that this guy was the overseer of the patch of woods that was used for the game  i could go on listing other details that gives more and more twist on the story but at the end nothing interesting happened apart form random shittalking    there are also the usual stuff vampire larpers hating on fantasy larpers and vice versa reenactors hating on larpers mouthbreathing retards running games that were outdated even 10 years ago etc    if you give me something to start on i can probably remember something interesting from the past but im the kind of storyteller who needs a bumpstart for this
  okay got any narcisist trying to destroy someone for no discernable reason and the fallout
  oh wait i remembered something kind of amusing it happened at a local con mondocon where we usually go to promote larping and stuff it also included the guy on pic i will type up the story in a minute
  from the top of my head no not really there are people who try with similar stuff but they arent necessarily narcissist or they doesnt achieve anything apart from being very loud for a very short time
  alright so we usually go to these cons bringing a lot of larp weapons that random people can try out because thats the most interesting part for most amount of people and if someone is asking questions and interested in the whole stuff we gladly explain to them everything sometimes we bring smaler larps too but so far the swordifghting is where we can get the best cost effective result that is with con organizers that are less then helpful sometimes    anyway we were doing the usual stuff handing out larp swords to people so they can try it out explain them a few important safety rules mostly about how to not hit the ground repeatedly with the swords and supervising them if they are being idiots or not usual stuff    in front of us a few meters away were a different group which we never really figured out what they actually do because of the fuck deficit we had but from friends and recognizing a few stuff we gathered the following most of them were from red line cinema which basically has a lot of actors figurants and various stuff that is needed for film making they brought a lot of crusader stuff which mostly werent that good ive seen better larping stuff but they had other guys with them too some selled some kind of hungarian comic and there were a few guys with various leatherworks in the deep hungarian style the kind that is mostly popular whit people who are very hungarian proud of it and also probably believe they are from the star syrius which is a few letter away from syria where you can find more leather stuff but thats for another rant the guy on pic  was with them and we later called him turulninja partly because we just cant figure out what he wanted to dress up as     
  assassin because they were middle eastern ninjas maybe a persian immortal in the 300 vein for the same reason but hanging out with the styrofoam crusaders hes probably an assassin
  yeah but he has a turul in the middle of his leather armour and there is a running joke here that your average guy can only recognize three things from history knights samurais and ninjas if they somehow listened at history lessons maybe roman soldiers but thats really stretching it      for reasons unknown this big group had a few larp weapons with them and if you were very observant you could figure out that they actually sold them it was some random epic armoury stuff but put way behind of anything without any kind of sign that they are for sale there were other stuff for sale the beforementioned leather crafts for example but there were a lot of stuff there just for show and at a passing glance you wouldnt even see the larp stuffs    so there they were the whole two days sometimes the crusader guys walked around and tried to look like impressive or act out some fighting but it was somewhere between servantmourning and homelesssorrow the turulninja was mostly just sitting there sometimes walking and thats all     we had a few hours time both days where we were in the official programs and doing our swordfighting stuff in front of them  we got a lot of people as always who wanted to try out our weapons the other guys and the turulninja barely got anyone around their desks  but the turulninja always looked at us for some reason and at the second day he was even started circling around the wannabe fighters and at the end was standing in the middle of it just watching it he also had some kind of fantasy cleaver with him so i just walked up to him and ask if he want to do a little fighting with his weapon and all that jazz because ive seen him standing there for several minutes now
  so the guy doesnt say a word but gets in a fighting stance and i was like okay probably not a talkative type     we fought a little there was nothing really interesting for the first dozen or so seconds he hit me a few times i hit him a few times  then he started to go full force holding his weapon both hands and trying to hit as hard as he can in the meantime his mask also came off and i could see that the guy is in complete rage mode for some reason  i tried to slow down and hint do the similar but all i got for that effort to get bashed in the head at the end of it i had to go up close and personal to try to grab his hand to stop hitting me while he started screaming that you are done and even grabbed my sword and tried to twist it out of my hand    to say the least this is considered bad form here    anyway i told him to chill the fuck out this is just a fucking game but when he stomped away he still screamed a few times that you are done now the top of his lungs so others several meters away also noticed    there is no great ending here because after he went back to their desks and my friends and others asked about what the fuck happened we left it at there made a few interesting theory about why the turulninja went full rage mode but thats all  most probable theory he got his feelings hurt that we were attracting more people and probably he was probably an ego champion who thinks he is some kind of bigwig and couldnt be hit in swordfight  but truthfully we had no solid idea and at the end of the day it doesnt really mattered because we will probably never meet him again
  that person sounds like they have more than two problems
  i never went away i lurk when i can but my life has been nothing but work lately so i have nothing new really to contribute no reenactments no nonwork living history no larps
  probably but then again you can describe it just him being a huge asshole
  i thought you were like a professional larper or something
  pretty much but between the museum and taking care of my grandparents i have a little time for my lady and friends and thats it
  history is now larping gropalope
    see america you can when you really want to
  doesnt he dress up in costume and play the role of a historic person live
  i do that every day we call it job around here
      its obviously a joke based on what i do for a living slavbro
  hungarian larpfag  slav  i think hungarians would like to have a word about that
  missing a joke several years in circulation in larpthread
  opps i exposed my newfag status
  one can never know with you guys had to be sure
  looks like warwick davis was this a larp or a bit part
the theme here is good male costumes but i cant tell if this last one is male
  warwick davis is an avid reenactor thats actually his hobby
  its a chick i can see dem titties
    was directed here from the help thread anyone have good resources for historical/medieval wedding stuff
  the mandatory book is medieval tailors assistant an older version is on the interwebs you can find it with a simple google search    then if you want something specific i would recommend patterns of fashion there are several books with specific cloths and how you can make them and while its mostly nobility and high end stuff there i presume thats what you need
  not necessarily im mostly finding costume resellers with stolen images and historical patterns sites with mostly fashion for women i just want more to look for    thank you for your recs
  do you have anything specifics in mind like a time period or geographical region
  i know this is a little broad but pre1400s im erring on the side of fantasy with my gown so it doesnt need to be entirely accurate i just want ideas so i can craft it myself     thank you again
  then forget patterns of fashion apart from getting ideas thats mostly later stuff    medieval tailors assistant is still good though    also for men look into gowns thats the outmost layer in civilian clothing around that time basically a coat thats the cool stuff in my opinion that could be worked into a lot of different styles
    clothing specifically for weddings isnt something that you really see until the 17thc outside of extremely rich nobels and even then its not what we would consider wedding clothes rather than just an obscenely fancy new gown etc    as hungarian says in  the medieval tailors assistant is your best starting point but if you can at least give us a culture/country and century rather than just pre 1400s we can provide more suggestions     it would also help a lot to know what your spouse is wearing     picture is a mid 14thc wedding
  forgot the link    
  sorry i had to wait until we were both at home to discuss since he knows quite some bit more than i do about the regions vs what ive been showing him i believe we are looking for germany/germanic garb
  im still in the baby stages for researching what i can as i am mostly a lolita and not a historian garb buff i genuinely appreciate any info
  now were getting some more narrow    your next step is to pick a specific century    for extra credit narrow it down to the first or second half of that century
  would 13501450 still be too broad
  nope thats good enough     also this link might help you further  
im gonna try to convince my group to go full on skelly at a new larp before we inevitably get permanently drawn in to campaign plots and cant try out new ideas     i dont have any photo materail on skeleton larpers though can you guys help me out with some inspiration
  not just skeletons but try and look for more of the untote fleisch pics from conquest not saying flowerfield is the best    but flowerfield is the best
  it depends compare the fashion of the year 2018 and 1918 thats literally a century of difference and yet the information and cultural exchanges between those dates and your dates is much less
  fair enough ill keep researching with the information youve given me so far and ill pop in again if i have more questions    im struggling with google because they use the same images for every era and region so trying to parse through what i want is difficult im sorry i dont have clearer answers
  that one in morristown with the really weird scene where if your not part of the larp clicks you just get ghosted    yeah pass
  ive yet to meet a larper wearing a facemask that wasnt a douchebag
  this is one of the few instances when i can recommend pinterest just put in the century and male clothing and if you find something that looks cool to you ask us or someone else if that is indeed from that time period and region    also during that time as far as i can remember germans didnt had a really distinct fashion and as with everything they didnt existed in a vacuum so stealing a few things from other regions is a valid option      meh ive seen people who can actually wear it meaningfully but yeah most of the people who are overly enthusiastic about it are just little shitters
  awesome thank you again
  seconding  well happily critique      facts
hey gropey i think i might have met your secret identical twin at an sca practice last night either that or ive started hallucinating your fat ass at every sca event i see
any good larps around new england i just went to my first ever nordic larp in pa called dammerung and it was fucking godlike i wish more amerilarps were a bit more built around telling a good story and less about foam slapping i wish i could attend drachenfest mythodea or witcher school but europe is across the water    could anyone recommend anything
  lets see what i have on the skeleton front i will be vague and probably include a lot of other undead also mostly from mythodea but whatever
  i kind of doubt it considering the fact that i was working last night and have been to an sca practice in the past 3 months    besides that i would have beat you like a harp seal
  get a gun bag like this     practically everyone in my hema club transports their weapons with a one
  armstreet is overpriced stainless steel shit dont buy from them
  ive met the women who made these suits they are absolute wizards with thread and fabric their costumes are beatiful
  yes a 1020 year gap is a good one
  who should i give money to then  i wanna buy larp armor that looks good and isnt too heavy
  roman tereschenko  jeff wasson / wasson artistry  william west / englyshe plate armourie  jeffrey hildebrandt / royal oak armoury  per lillelund jensen    plus erik d schmidt who makes mail armour not plate    theyre probably the top 5 just now theres also  eric dube  georges joliot   dave hewitt / white rose armoury  jiri klepac  jiri lucius  mark hale  capapie mail only  armour services historical probably the best brigandine armour out there  graham ashford / greenleaf workshop  nigel carren    if you cant afford custom armor marshall historical makes the best looking mass produced armor in the market id also advice starting with a lower class kit youll also save yourself from the headache of buying crap armor that doesnt fit proper
    might as well put oleg here a very respected figure in the earlymedieval reenactment scene known mainly for his sexy lamellar armors
  technically speaking most one handed swords and a buckler can fit in a violine case just saying      only if you want to do reenactment
    armstreet is ok if you buy in person only in person     what exactly are you looking for whats your budget      i am in absolute awe of their work and love the write up        i would be as generous as saying 50 for their purpose
  i can spare about 500 usd incl shipping a month for larping and other leisures
  so what kind of armour are you looking for like got an image or idea
  this is what i have now the chest plate is from some indian its shit and it doesnt sit well  someone stole my lovely red belt at a con and i gave back the aluminum mail i got from a friend  i also have the elias chest plate from mytholon that im not very pleased with    some generic fantasy knight aesthetic would do that doesnt look too elaborate or ornate
  looking like your trying for 15thcish continental next big question where are you us/europe/australia etc
      i forgot to mention i also have hourglass gauntlets that are just a little to big for my hands    im from israel the usual answer i get is go to local smiths who are farts that dont understand why i want thin light armor or just outright refuse to help because im not part of the local buhurt scene
  ah i remember you now bro im sorry man i dunno what shipping would be like for you from american craftsmen
  us shipping would murder me unless there is something i dont know  put forward some names of craftsmen you would recommend and ill try and see if its possible to get some nice easy shipping over here  if not i guess im doomed to either overpay or eurojanktm   imma keep looking anyway  good night and thanks for the help gropey
  this might sound like im shilling for oleg and i kinda am but if you want light armor for an affordable price hes your guy as he makes all his lamellar armor from 08mm spring steel  but it would mean that youd change your aesthetic from west to east but atleast you would look unique  
  i would be as generous as saying 50 for their purpose  50 is kinda pushing it specially what seems like higherclass clothing 13901415 is good
    you guys are still looking at it from a reenactor point of view which is only good if you are going to do reenactment     also 1 century timeframe to get a costume idea doesnt mean they will going to incorporate every fucking thing from that timeframe there are shitton of stuff that out of period but only fartslicers like us would notice and 99999 of the people wont
  clothing from 1450 looked something like this while midtolate 14thcentury looked like this  thats a lot of change
byzantine style best style  the guy in the pic isnt me btw
  for you what the regular observer would notice is it goes lower on one pic and not so much at the other and thats all so if you make it lower it will fit  if you try to apply reenactment viewpoint on everything you will have a bad time with other people
  ok weve got enough phallic helmets do you have any vaginal helmets
  i guess that a vaginal helmet would be a badly crumpled helmet like russian poleaxe to the dome crumpled
  hello anon i am actually planning my 16th german wedding so please ask me any questions because ive done a lot of research and know how to make german garb pretty damn well heres a pic of my fiance and myself
  didnt find much material but i got a bunch of inspo from them thanks                          based hungarian    thanks for the dump exactly what i needed
  the resources ive used are mostly woodcuts and paintings from the period if you want something historical you are not limited to just white though i plan on wearing it as usually women just wore their best dress
  i really like both of your cloths
  im still lurking was there any books in particular that resonate with you     i picked up the medieval tailors assistant as instructed upthread but id love more hardcopy references for research my local secondhand stores were largely carrying informational books on war tactic and weaponry
  my favourite books are    the first book of fashion its mostly mens but has great info on what the clothes were made from in great detail   landsknecht woodcuts kriegsvolker for a full book on woodcuts that feature some cute couple portraits   patterns of fashion not german but is an excellent resource for historical patterning and is the most accurate ive found   the tudor tailor not german but has excellent tutorials    look up books with the artist lucas cranach for some beautiful paintings of weather women for more extravagant dresses jetj actually made a dress with one of his paintings and its my dd      senpai noticed me
  youre absolutely wonderful thank you i also forgot to mention in my previous post you and your fiance look extraordinary
  thank you i wish you the best of luck and im always lurking if you need more help
  im asking around now im trying to find direct contact information with some of the local sca they will be the people to ask and wont be as cliquish as the bohurt community      i absolutely adore your kits congratulations on the nuptials
   landsknecht woodcuts kriegsvolker for a full book on woodcuts that feature some cute couple portraits  while this is indeed a great book it wont really help them as they want earlier stuff and lets be honest lk fashion is pretty specific although they might realize that is what they really want because its awesome    senpai noticed me  i always notice lk stuff  although there is one thing i noticed about your cloth which isnt wrong but strange to me the skirt part of the jerkin is made from additional pieces sewn on i think there were a few examples of this but generally the more pieces the jerkin is made of  poorer you are as an lk and its not that hard to include it in the front piece
  she asked for books that resonated with me and this one has been a favourite of mine for a long time    jerkin  the peplum was separate to make the waist more dramatic as the leather was too thick to do it with the normal method
  fair enough i just found it strange
  is anything from celtic web merchant worthwhile  specifically chestplates    /en/helmetsandarmour/platearmour/cuirassbreastplates/
  i ordered an ulfberth helmet there pretty satisfied with it    speaking of anyone have any experience with pic related or something similar i get the feeling that if you run while wearing one it will flop around like a motherfucker and maybe even hit you in the face
  generally offtheshelf breastplates tend sucks ass but if you want a one marshal historical makes good crap      a bad one will
  personally i have a falling buffe which is just kind of similar but could have the problem you mentioned  i went the 120 sure way and secured it in two different way first is the strap obviously you have to strap it in really tight if you have a proper gorget thats not a problem no choking hazard the second way is that there are two holes at the lower part of it and there are two whateverthingies comming out of the breastplate that you can put in a pin so its pretty much secured to it this way its pretty fixed in front of your face and to your breastplate so even harder hits wont move it away or gods forbid if you do fights with steel weapons
  this might be a retarded question but how difficult is it to create said holes with common tools in 16mm costume armour the arming points are no problem i have enough spares laying around from my jack chains
  common tools in 16mm costume armour  like 16mm thick or 16mm big model either way you will have a hard time    also here you can see it better maybe
  16mm typo
  a simple not shit drill could handle it
posting some historical examples of attaching a gorget
  here you can see the hole for the screw
  going to start smithing a sallet soon for my 15th century kit
  like green and red masks
what do you guys use for larp hype  inspo media etc
  pinterest and reenactment groups

  what location you going for brah
  probably german not going for a lobsterback though
  so what are you going for then a black one
  nah planning on making it pretty elaborate just with a solid back maybe with a single articulated lame
happy turkey and genocide day nerds
  happy blacks fightday clownfag
  ive decided to actually reply to this the name isnt to identify some post history or something like that the name is there because it is easier to put linebacker elf as a name to say that i am a 6 foot 5 inch broad shouldered person who is more likely to be confused for a viking berserker but has medically abnormally fair skin and likes to wear pointed ears that linebacker elf name also includes an implied natural color palate of green brown silver some greys and spurts of red and yellow and implies wooden and natural textures just think all that in two words wow    so i could include all that in every post i make asking something or just use linebacker elf and have it all implied    as for why i dont have a kit 3 reasons 1 the all important dollar 2 there are 0 good larps near me so why would i have a kit for a larp that doesnt exist and 3 ive been working on designing a tent that i will use 1 for lodging myself at any event i go to but also 2 for selling historically authentic and accurate food and maybe having 13 guest rooms where someone can rent the night and have secureable personal storage such as a footlocker/steamer trunk
  so you put way too much importance on your name that no one will ever figure out are a poorfag who doesnt even larp without even the semblance of a kit and has delusions of being a one of a kind caterer and innkeeper at events that you dont even know youll go to real cool there man
  its not a name and there is nothing to figure out it is self explanatory linebacker build elf    being poor or not really has nothing to do about it it just means that my finances are otherwise occupied would i like a better paying more fulfilling job than i currently have sure who wouldnt do i not have money i can spend on things no i have spending money it just goes to other things    as for the rest sure i dont know what events or when that i will attend thats half the allure ill be able to go oh look there is x event i think ill go and then go
just so we can shittalk about something less boring than names here is a little polearm sparring
oh boy uhm nnice weather today huh      that looks nice i wish i could fight you someday  whats the training in hungary like how much effort is there to improve in combat do you have any organized training or is it just lets fuck around with foamsticks every now and then
  generally speaking there are nearly none if we look at the whole larp scene  there are us a group of friends who are also into hema reenactment and stuff and a few of our friends who do this but not just for larping so there is a lot of intersection     then there are a few other smaller groups who either doesnt do regular training with the possible exception of one group or just do battlegames /boffertags kind of regularly    so while there are people who try to improve themselves on the national level its very irregular but on the other hand being a good fighter isnt that important either nowdays    i mean everyone who tries to do a dick contest about how good he is usually someone who isnt that good and you can easily find someone who is better but isnt an asshat about it
  ah i see pretty cool  so what are the important or appreciated qualities for a player aside from not being a dick      also not to judge but is your sparring partner there new if not what was he trying to achieve by striking so far out of measure not that im a hema master or anything but it just looked peculiar to me
does anyone here do something that is not medieval/fantasy larp because as a 20th century historical/contemporary/scifi larper this thread doesnt represent me
  he is not new we were just not the freshest and also did the whole sparring there very carefully and kind of slow because of the minimal protection we had    so what are the important or appreciated qualities for a player aside from not being a dick  fuck knows i always have a lot of heated argument about this with others  for me its the effort that the players should put in its a very good blanket term so the player should put some kind of effort time/money/skills/contacts/whatever in the game and take the _preparation_ seriously    for some people its the experinnce or to be more precise what they experience at a larp kind of like of how you should be able to believe in what the others are doing but also give you the possibility to experience the whole thing so basically the ability to play for everyone and not for yourself    some people obviously most concerned about the looks and there are also some who just there for a challange  probably a whole lot more but thats what gets to my mind with the broad strokes
  there are a few people but its just there are at least 25 fantasy larps for every non fantasy larp depengind on your region    i went to scifi larps milsims urban fantasy args/ various chamber larps /etc
  alright cool those gifs are really funto watch btw    another question if i get to bug you as well  whats the character of your stereotypical landsknecht like  its probably not clear so ill explain  when you have a character of a moderntime soldier in most media or even larps theyll usually be very stern have traditional values etc a knight would usually be your lawful good  pure hearted kind of guy trying to fight for the good or his kingdom kind of how crusaders saw themselves i guess a pirate would usually talk about booty the clinking king and plunder etc    whats the stereotypical landsknecht attitude or demeanor
like johnny depp  
  whats the stereotypical landsknecht attitude or demeanor  there is a mandatory disclaimer that your mileage may wary everything depends on the specifics etc etc    that said wealthy thug  if you want to be the stereotypical landsknecht that you are a bad guy there are a shitton of folklore stories and songs about how bad they are and they will burn down you village rape your daughter etc although thats true for most soldiers for that time    anyway landsknechts had a lot of many usually they had a very good pr as the best mercenaries that money could buy well at least after pavia though obviously this wasnt necessearily the truth but thats what al ot of people believed you were also exempt from a few laws like clothing laws just to name the most popular one and as a mercenary you went from one place to another until you left that work so you didnt stayed in a place for too long that meant if you fucked up somebody who wasnt with the army you travelled with he couldnt do shit    so yeah wealthy thugs
    turkey and genocide day  blacks fightday  i lold      is that you in the poofy pants      im part of a us national call of cthulhu horror game thats all 1920s another anon here does wwii weirdwar gropey does colonial era fairytale horror stuff iirc tons of wh40k larps
  yep
  so what are the important or appreciated qualities for a player aside from not being a dick  in larping in general lets see i expect or at least want everyone in the hobby to    make a continuous effort to improve  its okay to start off with a shitty costume its not okay to still wear the same costume two years later    uphold immersion  if you need to use clearly modern items do so out of view and then immediately put them away again dont make out of character remarks in locations where people are playing even if your present company isnt    act according to the atmosphere and tone of the scene  dont make a very serious scene silly and dont try to turn a very silly scene gritty    make a clear distinction between character and player  when youre in character assume insults arent aimed at you personally likewise when in doubt assume flirting isnt directed at you as a person either this works both ways dont try to interact with the player when they are playing a character    avoid metagaming  separate in game knowledge from out of game knowledge and dont respond to things marked as invisible or out of character do what your character would do not what you would do    metagame like crazy  fuck the statement above if it makes the game less enjoyable for all parties its what my character would do is a bad excuse for removing gameplay for another character instant death inescapable imprisonment total social ostracization instead come up with some way to create a more interesting gameplay experience for all parties involved
  that sounds pretty cool desu kinda wanna play one now    were they the best as in a landsknecht is so skilled hed fuck you up in a single combat and then youd get tons of those or are they just very brutal/disciplined/idk
  theres probably at least one world of darkness larp near you vampire the masquerade being the most likely with changeling the lost a distant second but thats still quite deep into fantasy territory additional problem is that they tend not to advertise or even be inviteonly    i know of several modern/scifi larps one historical larp and maybe one starting western larp near me but ive never personally been there i do attend biannual 40player chamber larps with varying themes since ive been there czarist russia postapo standard high fantasy modern prison fairytales 1920s american mafia pretty fun but of massively unreliable quality since the storytellers rotate every time
  they were allegedly and according to rumors the best as a mercenary army disciplined and skilled    thee are no real consensus or data on the 1v1 skills of landsknechts i mean there are some but some are arguable and others are exceptions etc one of the pointers though that a lot of them were citizens in various cities/towns which around that time meant they were skilled in weapon use but thats a far fetching stuff    anyway there were considered good at the early 16th century for mainly two reasons    1 there were several occasions when the landsknechte did indeed fought to the death after they got paid thats some serious shit if you are talking about mercenaries and also they got good results pavia is one of the most famous example where both sides had landsknechts and at the end the winning side even captured the france king there were mohács horribly outnumbered and in the end encircled but fought to the end for several ours and bicocca the landsknechte defeated the swiss pikmen there which were before them considered the most effective mercenaries     2 from the organization and the fact that citizens joined them mostly who already had good equipment came the fact that they had a shitton of firearms and artillery considered to other mercenaries and to other armies so they were not just very stabby people who could defend well against cavalry because of the fuckhuge pikes but also very shooty ones too and brought their own artillery if they had which is always a plus
arent all threads on cgl larp threads
  also funny story about 1v1 combat against a landsknecht  consider it more of a rumor because i could never find the source for it but here it is    there were some dispute between a bishop and a landsknecht and at the end it went on to be a duel however many days later  the bishop brought his weapon and servants these were the times where bishops and the like frequently went with their retainers so it isnt that surprising    the landsknecht brought his friends    obviously the bishop was beaten because he was at the wrong end of a gangrape    while the story isnt necessearily true it shows perfectly what people think about landsknechts and _probably_ how they behaved
  no not at all
  colonial era fairytale horror  info
new discussion    how much do you take your appearance into consideration when deciding what characters you wanna play do you find yourself able to portray multiple kinds of characters or does it draw you to a certain archetype if so  which
  no clue but those new larp muskets must give the game a collective boner
  how much do you take your appearance into consideration when deciding what characters you wanna play  im painfully aware of my appearance and shortcoming and i try to play stuff that i can actually represent in a meaningful way so no barbarians and the likes plus a few dozen other stuff that would need way too much charisma
  it doesnt matter if youre short or tall fat or skinny ugly or fair everyone can play an orc
  wont be as cliquish as the bohurt community    really ive seen quite a bit of cliquishness in my sca experience i cant imagine how bohurt would be worse
  dont play characters youre unable to portray applies to body as much as to mind but the limitations of my appearance feel so natural to me i dont actively consider them when making a character
  exactly what it says on the tin fairy tale/fantasyhorror themes just before the revolutionary war there are worse things in the forest then just wolves and brigands      yes i really want to get one of the muskets and bayonets and review to see how they are      i understand inclusivity and such like that but i just cant suspend but so much disbelief you dont see my fat ass trying to be a willowy elven prince      just like everything else and all depends on the group that you play with too many people think that theyre only able to play with the people that are in their specific area code find the group that meshes with you
  heard the larp muskets are kind of a letdown not sure what the system is they use but if you can replace the spring they might be better right now you have the range of a very sad premature ejaculation
    the larp muskets at least the first run  i dont know if any improvements have been made are pretty awful unfortunately the body is hard to replicate so i expect theyll shine after a lot of custom work on the simple i assume since its a springer internals as it is theyve got the power and range of a particularly ambitious fart see below for review     
  i cant imagine how bohurt would be worse
  coming from a guy whod say gropey is oft to whine and moan about rampant nationalism in a fighting scene bohurt can be bad really bad on the right wing front the teams are a massive amount of fun and great people though
  there was a team that tried to register their heraldry as two black lightning bolts in a while circle
    thats fucking disappointing we have pic related but theyre getting harder to find only come in pistol and pet peeve of mine has the lock on the wrong side    that said the spring is really easy to change out for one more powerful
  thsts subtle
  opening packages with a fucking karambit
  like a brick
  truth to be told that lightning bolt video and the joke is getting old
  damn shame i was following that kickstarter with interest it looks like the pistol is a bit better at leasti dont expect more than maybe 20 feet of effective range on any nerf pistol to begin with heres hoping they manage a second run that addresses the issues
a bit interested in this anyone have any regional sources/group names to look for im in boston/nyc most of the time
  good thing you added boston otherwise i was going to have to list dutch provinces to you
havent seen this thread up in a while   lets see it cgl
  all reccs appreciated
  1 and 5  maybe also ochako from boku no hero academia
  fuck off
  then dont address the gendered part of it you dont have to completely fill it out or share a template that is i wouldnt mind either way
9989129
    hardly anyone attempts to cosplay masked mememe i think you should go for it
  3 4 or 5 with the first two being my highest preference that light blonde hair looks great on you your face shape would compliment 4 really nicely
  wow i love this recc i might actually do her     lovely choice with mememeid definitely go for it     personally i think 1 is the best the bangs and shorter but lighter hair would be great plus giant maces are always fun  love that you have mgs on that
  i also have to second anons suggestion on     thanks im a bit of a metal gear fiend and id love to cosplay all the gals eventually
  youd be a good tomoko something about that picture of you squatting in the woods just really does it for me      seconding the masked mememe girl since its so rare to see cosplayed      meryl would be cute wish i had a good recommendation you dont have listed already short haired characters seem to really suit you
  ohhhh do number 4 girl
this thread  you mean an untitled thread that is guarenteed to go off topic because there is no topic
masklover here    def 1 second fave is 5    1 definitely would be cute   but also  kanna from kobayahsis dragon maid  hina ichigo from rozen maiden  chibi moon from sailor moon     i think you have the perfect proportions to cosplay a lot of cute chibistyled characters
  i agree with  you have a very good face shape for lots of cutesy characters case in point your star is adorable id love to see your take on volta as well
  nobunaga fate grand order anise tatlin tales of the abyss toph beifong avatar
  the green lipstick made me think of jolyne which you prolly could do well
  i see you a lot more as sabato from dokuro chan     i think youd make a really cute mei ow
  1 would suit your preference for the most coverage and i can foresee hilarious photos coming from it      holy smokes your ichigo is incredible i think youd look beautiful in the soft white pallette of euryale or touhous vibrant reds since it goes nicely with your hair
    5 posts has been the standard for as long as i can remember
            i made four anon pls
  thanks    i think asunas outfit from alfheim would really suit you i think its kind of in between the fantasy look but also has that kind of regal vibe like giselles dress
  thats a fantastic idea thank you
  ive always been a sucker for hanako so do that  im not sure if youre into the idea of changing the color of your hair but holo from spice and wolf seems like something you might be into      celty from durarara is always a classic      fitting in with the blonde with a gun id have to throw out seras victoria from hellsing  i might also kick around the idea of balalaika from black lagoon if youre looking for something a little more straight forward      im feeling ramona from scott pilgrim but im also gonna have to second kanna from dragon maid  if youre up for a challenge and wanna use your height to your advantage maybe look into riko from made in abyss      since it seem like you dont mind some exposed skin id like to propose the idea of birdy cephon from birdy the mighty decode shes cool as fuck and not enough people cosplay her      i got a soft spot for tutu not enough people appreciate that show  id like to recommend magane chikujouin from recreators her design is simple but also has some finer details to it that could make for a fun challenge
  where did you get your red hood helmet ive been hunting for a helmet/3d file that has the bit running around the head and chin to modify a motorized visor onto
  got it on etsy unfortunately the shop isnt up anymore last i checked
  damn     i know you said no more capeshit but i think youd make a good green arrow
fresh out of ideas any suggestions welcome      5 seems like your type of personality      you should definitely do meryl      you would make a cute mabel from gravity falls      youd make a good starlord
  magane chikujouin from recreators  thats a rec i honestly didnt expect i dig it i have a natural draw towards cutesy characters but youre right her costume does seem like itd present a nice challenge thank you also as i can see from your other recommendations you have a taste    i love the idea of the blue spirit its a lesser cosplayed character and the costume would accentuate your lean body nicely but the other anons suggestion of star lord was also spot on youd also fit any of your cosplay ideas well      ragdoll by a long mile or if youd like to stick with the nintendo theme samus botw zelda or rosalina blonde and light palettes look good on you in my head i guess lol
i prefer video game recs but anything works im always open to getting into new series       the way you took that squatting photo makes me want to see the tomoko pics you would get    nova from starcraft    your face would work for a lot of fire emblem girlsfaye or lissa would be so cute    seconding starlord new ps4 spiderman might work for you too
  tbh im only familiar with madotsuki but i see 5 looking really good on you      i really dig the journey playable character but the masked mememe girl would look really cool irl      rei or even popuko lol especially if you have a friend taller than you to go as pipimi      not familiar with these characters too but i think fink would look the best      this breaks the no crossplay but chevalier deon from fgo would be cool      definitely starfire       i used to really want to do rorschach i think youd pull it off really well   also boarding the do starlord train hahah      ragdoll and popuko      misato lara or even ellie from tlou
posted in the last thread but i didnt get many replies before the thread died so here i am again      i agree with a lot of others about tomoko not sure if youve played it but i think youd make a good jill from va11 halla    although the protag is a male you could always do a hotline miami cosplay since you like masked characters    im a slut for mgr so my heart says sunny i also think you could do rimi or aya from bandori    from your list fink is really good i also think you could do either sapphire or padparadscha from steven universe    since you mentioned ecchi anime maybe mikatan narugino from punch line    from your list i think starfire would be your best bet in terms of simple theres also serena or hilda from the pokemon games that i think would suit you well    its right on the line between capeshit and anime but im thinking hawks or best jeanist from my hero academia but im also gonna agree with everyone else on starlord    i really like the idea of shadow queen peach personally i think youd make a really good ms joke    from your list i think iris and lal fit you well i think in terms of metal gear youd make a good paz    i think nero is a really solid choice besides that i think you could make a good reigen arataka from mob psycho 100
  i can see from your other recommendations you have a taste  aww thanks it puts a big dumb smile on my face knowing you think that im definitely getting to work on the blue spirit its simple enough that i honestly cant remember why i had put it off in the first place      im also gonna cast a vote for ragdoll  if you feel like a really crazy long term project id suggest eowyn from lord of the rings but for a more reasonable suggestion annie leonhart from attack on titan in either her uniform or her titan form      definitely akane tsunemori from psycho pass      since you seem to be down with heavily armored characters id very much like to see you cosplay toyohisa shimaza from drifters you also pull off that silver hair pretty well so maybe kick around the idea of viktor nikiforov from yuri on ice      i only just recently got on the heroaca hype train so i have to admit i was secretly hoping someone would suggest something from that show  for you any of the dragon girls from maid dragon would work their designs are straight forward the characters have body types that work with people on the heavier side and the show is pretty goddamn popular so youll most certainly have that show in common with people at whatever con you go to
  yes jack frost hee ho
just a note about me i forgot to write it in but ive literally only cosplayed once as seen in the pic ive built more masks than that one though but thats the jist of my experience      have you considered raven from rwby with her mask on the journey one is a great idea though otherwise    sunny and meryl are great options maybe the boss as another mgs option    what about purah from breath of the wild    you mentioned fairer ladies and giselle gets me thinking have you tried other disney characters i feel princess aurora might be a good one here especially for being somewhat simple    blue spirit is a fantastic idea noncapeshit stuff maybe solid snake i feel like you have the hair and face to pull it off    shadow queen is a great idea dont really see that one usually done as for others what about fire emblem like lyn    your hair and face got me thinking of quorra from tron legacy that could be a good one as for what youve got listed reina would be really cool to see    the middle bottom pic of you really does make me think youd pull off a pretty good nero have you considered overhaul from bnha as well    jack frost and lottie would be adorable really but another suggestion i can throw out there would maybe be anyone from little witch academia
  you have some really good choices there but haru or lottie are my top choices
  my votes easily ashley or shadow queen because i would love to see either of them at a con i know shes pretty popular to do right now but im agreeing with anon on ms joke      from your list reina or iris i think would be great fits this might sound like a strange rec but if you like short dark hair and baby bangs i think you have a great face for an amélie poulain cosplay i think itd be really fun and theres definitely some ways you can make it recognizable       gonna go with everyone else and say nero for sure not a lot of guys can seem to pull off the silver/white hair id also suggest looking into diarmuid from the fate series hes got a few outfit variations to choose from and if youre into weapons hes got some bigass spears thatd be neat to make      lottie would be super cute especially if you could get a few people to join in with you im also super biased towards aa so i definitely vote maya fey i also think youd make a cute ema skye      i was totally gonna suggest overhaul before i saw you suggested it as well lol i have no idea how youd do it but that mask just seems like itd be so much fun to make and wear char aznable would also be way cool and i think people would love to see it
  omg please do chocola i think she would totally suit you
  you have such a lal haircut face but im feeling misato      first of all your taste in design is s rank great saiyanman and canti are good picks and seconding overhaul      okita is cute and i think youd look great with blonde hair      i feel like vash the stampede would fit you well      maya and lottie
  joylene but mei is a good choice too the possibilities are really endless with pokemon i could see you doing iris sun/moon protag hapu or a grunt from any team as for one piece ive never seen it but looking at the designs i could see you in tashigi or nefetari vivi
   have you tried other disney characters  i havent spent too much time thinking on that thats a great idea i love auroras first costume
    funny you both mentioned overhaul a friend cosplayed him while i was chronostasis in my middle pick id originally planned on overhaul until he asked me to make the mask for him certainly could go for it myself though the mask is easy now  i appreciate the other suggestions and compliments though id never considered char aznible before but hes definitely on the list now i love his design
  fantastic ideas i would say that mei looks a little too complex for your first cosplay making a decent set of googles would be pretty hard or expensive i think other choices are great but i feel jolyne is probs the best
  gwyndolin from dark souls    casper from deathsmiles    i hate to be that guy but youd make a really cute ramona flowers or
  100 yes on valentine   ive always wanted to cosplay as filia but it never happened
  faye and valentine would fit you very well but ill also throw out   celestia ludenburg or junko from danganronpa   misa amane from death note  lust from fma  nana o from nana  seras victoria from hellsing
  maybe check out rel from ergo proxy
how the fuck are all of you so pretty god damn _
  i could see you as a good raven    i could see you as val from the new han solo movie     i could see you as kurenai from naruto     maybe if you shaved the beard eren yeager     im seeing you as a gravity falls fan maybe something from that     10/10 would see you space cowboy as spike    one star lord cosplayer to another i would love to see you do star lord so we can have a dance off and have normies yell at us for ruining infinity war     cosplay bowsette or boosette      i could see you as elizabeth from bioshock     kyoko from madoka magica     karin from naruto     you would make a good fink     you would kill it as mantis from guardians of the galaxy     perhaps sayaka from madoka magica     galil no further questions
hope im following the rules correctly haha forgot to say that im taking a gap year so i can figure some stuff out before college and my current weight is actually 96lbs trying to gain some though because im shaky pretty much all the time    owen grady hands down heck you should audition to be starlord at a disney park you look so much like pratt    eileen for sure and im pretty sure youd be cute as lydia deetz if you like beetlejuice maybe morticia addams as well    can i just say that you look like youre probably great at comedic acting i love the idea of you as gwenpool or ruby rhod    maika if you like idol stuff i think youd be gorgeous as maki or dia from love live    honestly i think you could pull off a ben 10 alien really well if youre into that    another vote for lottie youre super cute    the first thing i thought was leon from silent hill    you could be a super cool femshep love the choice of ial too you would suit her well    popuko is always a good idea    hal jordan yes    that ballerina moon design is gorgeous id say go for it
  a sentence  taking a gap year so i can figure stuff out so i have a lot of free time to sew/build/etc
  i think every single one of your picks would suit you you obviously nail the cutesy look i especially love pink dress cinderella briar rose and erishuka if youre looking for a full coverage marvel character id suggest kamala khan medusa and scarlet witch
  please do cinderellas pink dress you literally have the perfect face for her
id use photos of myself in cosplay but i dont have any as i havent cosplayed before any suggestions would be awesome im still super new to this
  im not sure why the photos of myself got compressed so much sorry in advance
  you need to give 5 suggestions
  oh my bad im stupid im not very good at this but ill try    definitely valentine although the hair might be a problem faye is a close second but i think valentine suits you better    please do ruby i love the 5th element jolyne is a decent choice but honestly ruby just seems perfect for you just always be super bubbly and itll be great    i think youd be a really great asuka from what ive heard from friends plug suits are literally hell to wear though that may be a concern if you dont like being too hot or having to take a long time to put it on megumin is a really good choice too though i have to go with asuka    im gonna cast my vote on saiyaman as i love its design i would have gone with canti but that seems like an incredible challenge that i wouldnt even know how to begin to tackle if youre confident you can do it i think its worth a shot    i vote deku that design is great and i havent seen anything but school uniform dekus in a while
  normally people give new suggestions but i guess thats okay   the main character from no more heroes
  shinya or joker from persona 5 in his school uniform or rin from blue exorcist in that white button down
  i like tomoyo as an option for yours i can also see nozomi from love live as suiting you really well they have a lot of full coverage kimono outfits that may be up your alley      one of the sisters from kubo would be an awesome masked tall female character      ochako from bnha or chika from love live      for the love of god be volta      some of the fate franchise guys with cool designs would be a good place to start yu can buy a cheap cu bodysuit that looks pretty good and his props would be fun to make      i know everyone and their sister has done it but youd be a good 2b and theres crafting potential      jolene would be a blast maybe trish from part 5 since that would be a bit easier and the animes currently airing      the goth vibes remind me of shego from kim possible      owen i can also see a good professor willow from pokemon if youre good at wig styling      with your features and build people would go absolutley nuts if you cosplayed victor from yuri on ice
im really indecisive sorry    sorry for not knowing of anything you could do but i think okita would be pretty cool i dunno how many people cosplay as her though but yeah i agree with the other anon youd be a good asuka    awww dude id love to see a ruby dunno how well itd go though as its your first cosplay gwen looks like itd be good too    i wanna say janette just because i like that game i think eileen would be a good choice though    i like your star lord cosplay i think you could pull off owen really well but im not sure if thatd be recognizable so yeah be dinosaur man    briar roseeee  but i have no idea who any of these people are in all honesty maybe erishuka    dang man you got a look to you possibly shinya i think you kinda look like him    ohhh my friend loves mystic romance im inclined to say lucio just for that but i think you could do anyone of these follow your heart and do ramuda
  victor would be cool its something ive considered before contacts are a pain in the ass because my eyes are so small though    yeah i have a unique look which is why ive been apprehensive about entering cosplay shinya is probably my favorite pick at the moment
  skull kid would be dope i tried to bring some variety to my suggestions but really you could find any cape character or nonhuman  anbu black ops or obito from naruto no face from spirited away any character from bookseller hondasan the rocketeer metaknight gajinka red hood from dc a splicer from bioshock
  since your measurements imply you being somewhat tall and lanky maybe lelouchs zero costume from code geass you can buy decent premade ones for something really easy and cheap with minimal sewing theres always a shy guy
all recs are appreciated both male and female are fine anime manga jrpgs etc    tomoko for sure     mememe would suit you     youd be a super cute cure custard    bean    orin    i think youd make a great sailor jupiter     im going to suggest the flash and daredevil    super cute ragdoll    youd make a lovely meryl    deku or spike    haru    saiyan man for sure    youd make a great okita and chocola    youd make an amazing joylne     foggy from daredevil    youd make a cute cure pine    nightwing    i love your yurio youd make a great rohan and giorno     skullkid
  yuuko would look great on you seeing a character from precure was a cute surprise if i knew your anime interests i could tweak these a little more finely to your tastes but i think  ryuko matoi in her casual or school uni yuu kashima from gekkan shoujo nozakikun utena maka from soul eater or nana o would look good on you
  i think youd make a great sailor jupiter   it makes me so happy to hear you say that i adored her as a kid and still do
so many good looking people here
  lust from fma or olivia armstrong
  i think you have a perfect look for shinya its definitely one of those cosplays that i think youd want to do with a friend or pick up a dominator prop for only because on their own psycho pass characters just look like people in suits lol   i think asukas probably my next plan but yeah im super curious how the plugsuitll be especially since ill probably get one of those latex ones it doesnt sound super comfortable at all lol but damn they look good     also thanks everyone for your suggestions since i posted ive done both okita and chocola hahah your guys input was a big part in my choices
im really new to this ive only cosplayed once so im not exactly skilled at crafting    you would make a great yukako    i agree with the others skull kid would be a good one    yooo you would pull off rohan really well    i can see you as joker from persona 5 spike is also a good idea    holy shit you are a perfect owen    you would be a really good sucy from little witch academia eileen is a good one too    all of these ideas are great great saiyaman and dr nefarious would be sick to see though
  dark pit  p5 protag
 here back to make more recs/responses      ive definitely thought about doing a maid dragon cosplay specifically i was wanting to do office attire elma at some point    your chronistasis looks really good im a little biased so from your list id say saiyaman but i personally would suggest plague knight from shovel knight ans ive actually cosplayed jasminka from lwa i really want to fix some things with it and rewear it at some point    you have a perfect face for asuka imo i also think youd be a really good parasoul from skullgirls    you would be a great jolyne in terms of this being your first cosplay and since you mentioned really liking it id say you make a good blue/leaf from pokemon    im extremely skullgirls biased so id definitely say valentine id also suggest high pixie from smt/persona if thats a series you like    i have to agree with everyone else on owen you have the perfect pratt look if you dont mind going a little more rugged i think you could do dojima from persona 4 also i meant to keep up with gravity falls but never managed to    i think you have the perfect look for either cinderella or briar rose but my nostalgic heart wants to say amu i do also think youd look pretty good as lady maria since you said you like soulsborne    i definitely agree with others who have said shinya as well as the anon that suggested travis touchdown from no more heroes    youd be a perfect giorno i think in terms of something more thriftable though you could go with yusuke from persona 5 in either his school uniform or one of his casual outfits    skullkid would definitely be a lot of fun im guessing you prefer vidya so ill also suggest the hotline miami protag to you since theres several mask options to choose from
  couldnt fit the last two so part two      from your list definitely yukako if you want to do something thats a combination of cute and darker colors id suggest either rinko or ako from bang dream    as much as i want to see more uncle death cosplays i think either kris or dark pit are the best from your suggestions i also think you could do either deku or iida from bnha
  dark pit would look great on you i agree with the joker from persona 5 recommendation otherwise id suggest rin from ao no exorcist zuko from atla dad sasuke or ichijo from nisekoi
  weight void
never cosplayed before besides a dumb jotaro costume im looking for a bunch of suggestions on what i could pull off well with my type of face for the ideas i just added a few that might work but please let me know
  you need to put five suggestions
  white blood cell from harataku saibou bucky or quicksilver from mcu rintarou from steins gate eddie wouldnt be a bad idea but youll definitely need a prop to cement the idea of the costume i think you have the right jawline for venom snake too essentially any lean strongjawed anime character would be an easy pick for you the older mature guy type seems to be the genre youll need to sift through i hope you enjoy your first cosplay experience
  tbh your face is very similar to chris evans so i think you could pull off an mcu captain america really well also you can certainly rock officer k bruno and venom snake
  nero 100 on account of silver hair looking good   im really drawing a blank on who else you could pull off but i know theres a ton of characters      you could pull off okabe but i would definitely think about the beard honestly i think it limits you a lot       ruby rhod would be f a n t a s t i c on account of not seeing any cosplayers let alone crossplayers do him honestly wasted character i feel      janette would be a solid choice and the small community of vtmb would love you for it its a niche pick though i honestly think you could pull off a crossplay suzuya from tokyo ghoul and i think it would be right up your aesthetic       owen star lord solid pratt look like others said seriously its like you were born for the role       shinya and travis are both good choices others have said you could also pull off byakuya kuchiki from bleach with those eyebrows actually i think you could really rock it if you can get the wig right      ever played darkest dungeon leper has a pretty easy costume i would say but he needs a bit of foamwork he wears a mask too if you can do that highly recommend him      persona 5 protag 100 you have the look for it and you can go either way of combat attire or casual school uniform id recommend combat just because its a bit rarer and its flashing imo      captain america 100 as someone else said you could also pull off bj blazkowicz from the new wolfensteins or honestly any of the ryan gosling movies like you said office k i would highly recommend the driver just because i love the jacket and the movie and the soundtrack you can also pull off jacket from hotline miami extremely well    i really like looking at these types of threads because it helps me figure out good characters for myself so thanks everyone ill post when i get enough self confidence to
there are this many cute girls on fochun  what the fuck do you guys go on other boards
  i dont know why people are always so surprised by this lol cgl somehow got this rep of being filled with ugly fattychans but our whole board is dedicated to makeup skincare diet fashion and getting photos taken
solid with sewing and props suggestions would be great      tomoko would be perfect or tsuyu would be cute and no skin    2b from nier    sunny or cure custard    fink or squirrel girl    midnight from bnha    ballerina sailor moon is precious    blease be hawks from bnha    ragdoll would be great or ashley    angel from borderlands    deku or marko from saga    lottie is adorable or nurse from disgaea    canti please or overhaul if you like bnha    lady from dmc    i like gwen poole    eileen or the doll    owen andy dwyer clearly but also owain from fire emblem    amu or erishuka    rohan or allen walker could be a good casual    skull kid or pyramid head as long as it is in fact out of dominos boxes    yukako    dark pit or deku
  i think subaru is going to fill that prop and sewing itch for you plus i think you have a great body to show off that costume work theres also saber from the fate/ series kairi or aqua from kingdom hearts in any of their respective outfits personally i think that kairis newest outfit from kh3 would look nice on you
  u would make a great 2b or 9s from fire emblem i think you would good as lyn aversa the ones with a bit more mature look
  victor from yuri on ice     skull kid     youve got a great build for jojo characters jolene would be good too    tharja
hey cgl who would you say are the best cosplay photographers in north america
ebk  everage

not op but ppls respond   some guys i follow on insta that im pretty sure are all in the us   topheroriel  maison_hikari  rudyphototaker  dietary_fiber  sohnophotos  ethereousphotography  aleestudios  alive_alf  atheljpg  chezphotocosplay  headphonestudios  charleslanphotography  dancingsquirrel  spazbydesignphoto  kelvinsigh  vontog  sorario_days
  uh huh and which one of these are you
  none im fucking garbage lad   maybe next year ill self post
  seconding athel his feed says it all
    athel only does a decent job if youre an asian girl
  i can attest to this my entire shoot was a bunch of different angles of like practically the same pose all in portrait he didnt want to spend any time shooting with me and pretty much rushed the entire thing
why do so many photogs look like the typical bullied nerd you would see in a sitcom  overweight unkempt looks look like they havent slept in ages etc
    because they are bullied nerds  they use photography as a way to get fap material
  you think a hot guy would pick up photography as a way to pick up girls please photography is expensive
  why do people at nerd events look like nerds    its a mystery
  they do pick it up they tend to be rapists
  none
    emcp without a doubt     they are one of the best and brightest in the business and will get the job done for you years of experience i am telling you this person is a professional in his craft and what he does is amazing work
    can vouch for this anon a work will shoot with emcp again any time
      im asian and athels shots still sucked i know he goes on cgl too so wonder which response he is
      hello eugene maybe this year you can afford a badge with those thousands you be rolling in instead of sitting across the street at the park like you did at nycc    
    that article is lies and slander for all you know those screenshots are fake
i wonder what ever happened to blue shell photography
  can vouch for emcps creepiness 0/10 have blocked him from my page
      i remember this guy sperging out in the katsu photography group early this year is he still shooting cosplay
  he is trying to i occasionally see his posts pop up in a local cons group
    i had to double post for this    two posts back to back supporting this dude 998 both posts are his   02 one is his and one is a friend of his   00 someone that actually likes his photography is willing to pay to shoot with him or is not doing cosplay boudoir      some on here are pretty good a lot of them have a same style/look that tends to be bland after the first or second photo some are only good if you are attractive       most of them are average in general best overall isnt plausible to judge too many variables to keep anyone consistent what might be good to some cosplayers would be just basic level once you compare to some full time photographers who shoot creatively
i am a photographer  i dont typically shoot cosplay outside of sdcctop tier photographers dont shoot cosplay i know two photographers that also shoot sdcc that i would trust to shoot me if i were a cosplayer not to be racist but most of the asian cosplay photographers i know i know 2 are really losery and geeky the post super cringe worthy stuff on social media about being behind the lens but never getting the girl ect ect
  thats because people are thinking of nerds as opposed to actual nerds
    i am a photographer  i dont typically shoot cosplay outside of nycctop tier photographers dont shoot cosplay i know two photographers that also shoot nycc that i would trust to shoot me if i were a cosplayer not to be racist but most of the black cosplay photographers i know i know 2 are really losery and geeky the post super cringe worthy stuff on social media about being behind the lens but never getting the girl ect ect
  ouch sounds like your asian nerd i like that you are trying to compare a hassy to a dusty old soviet camera its like corralling a ferrari with a yugo
  emcp  this guy is laughably bad doesnt know how to frame an image 0 post skills
  that sad feel when you will never pose your favorite cosplayer like this because your too much of an asian incel
    bububut making your models stare directly into the sun and cutting off hands constantly is best photography anon
  nayrt but you can stop now his work is mediocre at bestand there are several accounts of this kind of shit going around so youre either eugene himself or youre a close friend of his trying to white knight him
  oh eugene youre such a kidder molester      he goes by just cosplay photography now
any good female photpgraphers  cant trust a male one it seems especially for the sexier shoots
  bunny tuan
    dancing squirrel was mentioned above and shes pretty good clouds cosplay photography vicissijuice sorario days
  10/10 bait got me to respond
  in the southeast shashinka cosplay photography and momo clicks photography are pretty good
          haters gonna hate    but his p game ridiculous you know what im sayin   
  sorario days is annoying and whiney as fuck though so beware of that she loves to start shit on her personal fb
lawrence brenner he taught the greats dont you know
  shashinka cosplay photography is horrible with photoshop raise your standards anon
  oh no i actually like her work   ppls give examples of her starting shit real curious
      seconding im the anon who memtioned her and had no idea just saw her work spill the tea
      different anon but all i know is she can be slow with photo delivery at times and she complains about people if they dont post her photos after delivery calling them ungrateful and not applauding her work if you dont like the edit and ask her to reedit youll also get brought up on her personal facebook and in real life basically she doesnt have thick skin and thinks any complaint is you being an unreasonable customer same if you complain about late photos
    this ive also seen her complaining about how people are ungrateful for only tagging the photographer in the photo instead of ing them in the description basically a bunch of extremely petty stuff along those lines shes a huge bitch about her customers
      yikes sounds really unprofessional
worldofgwendana varies for me  it feels like he bumps his contrast and saturation too much sometimes but i like his composition and variety    justincosplay does mostly hall shots and has a fun and varied feed ie its not the same dozen highprofile women in scanty outfits    elitecosplay has an absurd name but at least they tend to do more highproduction shoots to live up to it      solitadphoto is nice
i always wonder what happened to some of my old favorite photographers skypirate  rising sun were good and did fun photoshoots but theyve just sort of faded out of the limelight i dunno if they got tired of cons or what
        im on her personal fb and ive never seen any of this shes outspoken on her public twitter and instagram about photographer credit and courtesy but ive never seen her shittalk anyone specifically client or no behind a locked page screencaps please or it didnt happen
  she vague posts rather than directly naming the person but its pretty obvious who shes talking about already unadded her because of how bitchy she was but maybe the other anon can deliver
  athels a bitch after his little whining about the ktsucon badges
    im on the east coast nj but these are some locals i follow    odinsiris  unlimitedcrossroads  rongejon  knightmare6  thepicreative  cozpho  davescosplayphotography  dappermoosephoto  maryelainephotog  infinityxinfinityphoto  dtjaaaam  icemanx62
any canadian suggestions
  i was hoping someone would post this thanks anon
  amie photos athel rogers sohno photos maison hikari don dolce lost dumpling and con mom photos are some of the photographers i follow
  agree with worldofgwendana i like his composition but the editing is a mess oversatyrdated puke of colors reminds me of kevineritas early work
    thirding gwendana if he just cleaned up his editing his stuff would be nice to look at as of now its all just   crush those blacks  highlights to max   saturation up up up
        im fucking blind by the amount of bleeding from worldofgwendanas instagram are you guys high the yellow oranges and greens are just so bad theyre going neon is he just sliding the stauration and vibrancy sliders all the way up
  we werent disagreeing with you we all have problems with his work he has potential but saturation
  anon you have shit taste half of these people are not even active icemanx62 posted one photo during the last year and the other half are just gwc you think unlimitedcrossroads is one of the best photographers
  i just said they were local photogs i follow
emcp hands down best photog in the east coast 3
  sorry to burst your bubble emcp has quit the game about a year ago
  i heard he was cat fishing cosplayers at anime nyc
  is that why hes still hitting up cosplayers to shoot you and i have very different definitions of quitting
  source i have not seen him at cons and he stopped updating his social if he dn cosplayers and they shoot with him then its their fault
  why not amiephotos shes currently the most popular photographer on the east coast and i found it odd shes absent from the list
  different anon but youre replying to someone who just posted a list of people they follow it isnt a definitive list post your own    amiephotos has nice portraiture but most of her photos are very samey shes also nowhere near the most popular east coast photographer so thats a very strange statement
  i actually thought i added her to the list   i dont know if id say shes the most popular on the east coast but she certainly is very good and can work with literally anyone and come out with nice stuff
    meant to say one of the most popular east coast photographers nobody else charges 195 per shoot and sell out in a couple of hours shes lauren pihl level of popularity
  195 per shoot  holy shit why
    what a selfpost lmao
  amiephotos  seems basic
amiephotos is a fake they only take 6 paid shoots a con and fill the rest with friends for free to appear booking out they also are charging nearly 300 for katsucon to call her the most popular photographer on the east coast is laughable
  195 x 6   fun time shoots with friends to fuck around   idk man that sounds pretty comfy
  hate to add to the drama pool but i know a lot of people that have shot with her but none of them have paid for their shoots at past cons but many have appeared in her advertisements that said her stuff is nice but her variety of editing is limited nothing wrong with her price and number of photos delivered though
  paul hillier/kamerapeople
  amiephotos  cloudsofsands    are two east coast female photographers i follow
  paul hillier/kamerapeople  one of the very few that knows how to use a camera in toronto
  i follow don dolce lost dumpling and con mom their aesthetics are really good
  dumplings aesthetic sense is very good but what i hear from my canadian friends is that he doesnt give back spectacular or infocus photos to his paying customers he only puts in the effort for his cosfamous friends     i once saw him bitch vaguely about how someone sent him an anon message about how much work he puts into his cosfamous friends and how he treats them versus how he treats others who arent granted this is a while back so i dont remember the exact details
    dudes just trying to get in with the cosfamous group hes been seen hitting cons the past year now following anna fischer and elysiam/kay
  what exactly is wrong with this  dude knows how to use his camera and get some delicious shots
  ive shot with him and i find that his framing is good but he doesnt direct you for posing and doesnt edit much besides some color and lighting the people i see him shooting frequently like kitsurie yume and hikarin all shoop the shit out of their photos so im sure that theyre the ones making the results look so good   i was happy with the photos i got but i dont need people to pose me
  theyre shit people and people associating with them either get converted or thrown out after theyve been used as much as they can
    195 per shoot is pretty good its just cosplayers are used to dirt cheap price not even price at that point
    this comes up every time somebody points out how ridiculous photography prices are if you want professional money go take headshots and christmas photos of suburban families in matching sweaters con photogs do cosplay photography because they like the subject and like going to cons and like picking hot girls/costumes they like/obscure series/whatever     you dont get paid full professional rate for whats essentially tfp work except most the time the model still isnt getting print rights
  im okay with people not wanting to pay high prices for photos but they shouldnt get mad when someone asks for it just simply decline
    asking good money for a shoot doesnt make a photographer an asshole
    lol i wouldnt call these gwc professionals most of them dont even shoot in manual
see a really nice shot on a cosplayers insta  they credited the photog so i check out their insta   photog is just another cosplayers who doesnt even seem to shoot at all or make photography any part of their lives   why do i even try
  sometimes cosplayerswhoalsoshoot dont have a separate account because they mostly promote themselves as a cosplayer whos the photog
  anna fischer and elysiam/kay  who      don dolce good    con mom she hates being confused with alex rose photography which is sad as con mom is better    lost dumpling not bad
  fischer scammed a bunch of people out of money with her kickstarter for her wild places project and sometimes shoots for kotaku no idea on the other person
  alex rose made a post about how it takes no skill to shoot pretty cosplayers    alex ross also manages to make pretty cosplayers look ugly    i cant see why con mom dont want people to confuse them
  thank you caption fly away now      con mom and alex rose share the same first name why people get confused when they meet con mom    alex rose made a post about how it takes no skill to shoot pretty cosplayers  alex ross also manages to make pretty cosplayers look ugly  does explain her level of skill
    i am not remotely a fan of alex rose as a person and as a photographer but why do people praise con mom so much i feel like her shots are so boring i even ended up unfollowing her even in that persons list don dolce and lost dumplings are so much better imo i dont get the con mom hype
  why do people praise con mom so much  the market demands female photographers she is the best female photographer in her area helps out alex rose and many other female photographers set the bar very low which helps drive up her praise
  pretty much this when novii got busted and left a holr in the market she changed name and picked up the pieces a shame people put female photographers at such high regard looking over the mediocre photos
    yeah not impressed by what i just saw of con mom but at least they look like decent photos just very vanilla
  yeah i mean shes clearly talented i agree her composition and editing are both very nice and shes miles ahead of most cosplay photographers in toronto but like very nice doesnt really accurately match the amount of hype and praise i see for her     though i checked out amiephotos who a bunch of ppl above were mentioning and wow i actually love her stuff i dont find the editing repetitive at all desu she seems really talented 195 is insane but maybe someday if i go to an east coast con ill splurge i legit like it that much
  her saturation and contrast is so bad this sounds like such a selfpost
  her saturation and random splashes of flares is just her aesthetics you either like it or you dont clearly enough people like her enough for her to charge such a high price
  lol its not i literally was the one asking about canadian photographers because im canadiani dont know shit about photography so youre probably right but to me her photos are really really pretty     also yikes i just realized either autocorrected to desu wtf kinda weeb shit is my computer on about
  desu is sitewide replacement for t b h newfag      people literally look orange in some pictures  jjust aesthetics  stop selfposting you already got called out for it in the katsu thread  you can charge as much as you want that doesnt mean people are actually booking
  sadly vanilla is all you need to be successful in toronto because all the other cosplay photographers novii white specs don dolce every other asian photographers only shoot thin white/asian cosplayers
  oh im new i didnt realise i just came back and saw it and thought i made a typo and read over the sentence and either fit
    what thet said whos the cosplayer we can help you
    jplmcosplay_photographie  white specs  don dolce  kimimaro_meteordust  arthur_sayanoff  rendomfotografu  eosandy_  bluepotionphoto  crazyball  dasgeminii  ben_i_images  studiozahora  solliefotose  solitadphoto  gilphotography  tonycotzajay  jrulison        well the asian cosplay photographers left a market open for any meh person to make money so the market got flooded with sub par talent
  i dont think hes the best yet but check out felix dandy hes a new photographer but hes already pushing out some amazing photos color grading on point and excellent with posing
  a bunch of these are european at least arthur_sayanoff and dasgeminii are def not from north america
ripping off the cosplay thread but im genuinly interested to know how lolita has had an impact positive or negative on your self esteem self image or worldview in general
lolita fashion makes me care about myself  thanks to lolita fashion i have a full hair and skin routine and ive fixed my posture  its not scary to think you look good when youre wearing lolita because it feels like you just think the clothes look good not yourself its not so cocky feeling  also its forced me to become more confident and less apologetic  over all its had a huge positive impact on me
  lolita made me appreciate myself i was never interested on my looks but lolita made me figure out what flatters me and how to take care of myself because of that i definitely feel more confident    generally lolita has thaught me much more than just appreciating my looks i have learnt to be critical of other peoples views of me and that i dont have to live for anybody else than myself my self esteem still sucks but i would be much worse if i hadnt gotten into lolita i also dare stand up for myself more often than i used to    in the other hand lolita has made some of my problems more intense i often still feel fat and ugly but i had these feelings before lolita too social media can really be tiring and make me anxious but its easy to shut down of course lolita has brought so much positive content to my life it outweights easily the few more negative aspects of it
  seconded   in addition to this its also helped me put myself ahead of others  not in a selfish way per se but in a confident im not your doormat way  something ive struggled with for many years at the risk of falling into a cliche it is actually like my armor whenever im about to head out and feel anxious i look in the mirror before i leave the house to remind myself that i look cute as hell and have nothing to be ashamed or afraid of it makes dealing with the world easier in a way  this fashion has taught me so much about myself and about people in general and im endlessly grateful to have discovered it when i did   thanks past me
  lolita changed how i saw my body i am short and i have very thick hair and a more hourglass shape that felt too sexy no matter what i wore but lolita changed that for me my height makes me perfect for hemlines and the fullness of the skirts balance out my body shape without oversexualizing it ive taken so much more care of my skin hair and nails and indulged in feminine things i always wanted to but was teased for being too feminine    lolita really gave me the confidence to be myself without hiding and i cant appreciate it enough
  growing up i always had very geeky hobbies and all my friends were boys which made me feel pressured to dress more boyish to fit in with them when i became a teenager i became more interested in girly fashion i wanted long hair and i loved reading about princesses historical fiction but i noticed i was treated differently by my friends when i dressed more girly some teased me some made a weird attempt at flirting so i stopped only last year i found lolita and fell in love with it so hard it doesnt matter my old friends might treat me differently ive always hated jeans
  ive always had weird level of selfimage where i dont think im unattractive i just genuinely dont know what i look like and what if anything is appealing about me i cant say that being in the fashion changed that it just made it different i continue to be uncertain as to whether i am cute or not and while i think my hair is pretty nice i dont know if anything else about me is really that suitable for lolita but the fashion is cute comfortable and makes me happy i also enjoy the collection aspect of it and have made some very good friends through it the only problem is that it makes me want to lose weight even though im close to underweight and fit into everything i own not really sure why i feel that way
while im forever grateful for the fashion and community for making me sometimes feel beautiful and for being fun the fashion really created negative body image issues i got into the fashion a skinny underweight preteen who fit everything but then i became a fat highschooler and the feedback on cgl was viscious i can say i never once thought about people being fat or skinny or that being something that applied to me until getting into this fashion    i stopped wearing it for awhile lost weight and came back but im still twenty pounds away from that body i had when i was 13 i feel disgusting sometimes borderline suicidal because ill likely never be that thin again without starving myself i wish i wasnt such a weakling and i had the strength to just stop eating     weight issues aside lolita did teach me the joy of dressing for myself and not the attention of men it also taught me how to ignore people staring at me in public it wasnt all bad and the negative effects on my self image come more from the community than the fashion itself
  lolita has at times helped me out of depression maybe its dumb to say this but lolita has given me something to care about and work towards and ive learned a lot of life lessons through it     ive learned to work hard because working hard means more money for brand    ive learned to budget because if i can afford my necessities and have excessive savings i can buy lolita without worrying about the cost     ive learned to be ambitious because my life dream involves having hundreds of dresses and having a nice home that matches my aesthetic a lofty and frivolous dream but i wont stop until i get there or beyond     ive learned patience because sometimes my dream dress is hard to find or maybe i lose an auction and have to tell myself ill get it next time     ive learned independence because caring if other people think if my clothes are weird or the things i want are stupid it wastes my time and energy and only pushes my goals back farther     ive learned to take better care of myself and my body because having healthy skin and hair and nails will always look better in lolita and when you look good you feel good     ive learned self confidence because theres no use being timid about people staring at me if i want to wear lolita     ive learned self improvement because if im not worthy of my clothes then id rather just not wear them at all     ive learned so much and worked so hard taken better care of myself and tried to be a better person and am working to a truly great and ambitious future ive really turned my life around a lot   and its all because i look at silly dresses and think to myself man i just really love lolita
    lolita actually had a negative influence on my self image and self worth i had a decent self image before it and since wearing it i only see the faults in myself i feel ugly and unwanted in this fashion
  why wear it then serious question if it doesnt make you feel cute/elegant/beautiful whats the point
  i love you anon
haha yeah all this shit is super cool and important and im glad youre all having such a great time developing into super confident amazing people
  because the communitys weight standards are insane especially for tall or stocky girls
  this is beautfiul
  maybe they felt fine until someone told them otherwise
  right this thread is full of fucking lies
  just because you feel differently doesnt mean its all lies
  im not talking about me though    im talking about what ive observed on this board and its not the bullshit in this thread
  whats the truth then come on
i used to be very good looking and got way too used to it now that im almost 30 and my looks are starting to fade i realise that you can get away with being a mediocre dresser if you have a pretty and youthful face and if you are exceptionally pretty your mediocre outfits will even be praised i used to wear no makeup and the most basic shit all the time and still got praised and today i have to try a lot harder to not receive any stupid nitpicks that are not even related to the outfit i am kind of scared to share casual outfits because i feel like i cant meet the expectations anymore and i know that it wont get better with time   lolita has harmed my selfimage quite a bit i started out just for fun but with the time passing it enabled the narcissist in me and it feels shallow and pointless being part of any community just for the approval thinking about making my online profiles private and going lonelita for quite some time and i probably will at some point
  lolita taught me the world is full of jerks  and that theres no jerk free safe space hobby   it made me confront this truth and then ask myself what level of jerk are you comfortable sharing space with it taught me that i do have control in what i expose myself to but that part of that reality is there are certain aspects of human behavior well never escape but that i have the power within myself to choose how it affects me i use to wonder omg why are certain fandoms toxic wheres the nontoxic subculture and hope / expect the outside world shields me from negativity now i know its in me to see and support positivity around myself and to ignore the things i was upset to find in the first place
  i feel you so much anon its done very similar things for me too on the downside the body image issues im pretty healthy for a us woman but could be thinner so maybe if lolita motivates me to work out itll be a good thing though i cant do much about my intense roman nose other than surgery and every time i see fannys beautiful face i feel more and more like i should get it since i feel like i have an ugly face and its given me a bit of a shopping addiction since i was raised in a dealseeking family and im always trawling through secondhand for dream items but end up buying too much     but in positives i feel beautiful and unique when i wear the fashion its a bit arrogant but i feel fashionably above everyone in the countryside areas i live in the compliments i get while going out are so nice and being told i look like a model while going out and aboutit really makes my day when i still feel like im ugly compared to a lot of facially blessed girls    and i feel  in that i hated being short and relatively petite before lolita since my family is all like 6 and was a total ugly tomboy before lolita now i happily embrace my size since i fit almost everything traveling in japan was easy and im so much happier with how ive grown out my hair and present myself makeup is a crazy life changer once you figure it out    and its given me a bit of a community too between the fb groups the two friends ive made from my tiny ass local comm and cgl theres always people to talk to didnt have that for a while when i left my previous hobby that had a large and fun community but i just didnt have time for the hobby anymore    fujiwara teaching us that we can still wear jfash and be elegant even after we hit 30
  lolita made me appreciate my natural hair texture more which i used to be seriously insecure about having grown up in the 00s era when straighteners were everywhere it made me happy to be average/short in height because its perfect for brand it eventually helped me to give less fucks about people staring at me or what strangers think and to get good at responding to compliments and questions politely but without getting dragged into a conversation meets made me better at small talk and less of an autist it taught me how to spot quality in clothes and buy things that would last i think it made me overall more appreciative of aesthetic beauty in nature beautiful objects and good colour combinations and it forced me to get good at makeup and posing when i didnt really care about it before its fun to look around work or other places when im bored thinking about which people would suit lolita and what theyd look best in    downsides  it made me care about things that didnt bother me before like avoiding sun damage to the point where i got really unhappy when i accidentally caught a tan last year i used to like being busty but now i hate how it makes some things fit like  i got into the fashion when i was underweight and can no longer fit my first dress because a lot of my lolita is unshirred minor fluctuations in weight that i wouldnt even notice before freak me out since they size me out of wearing my smaller pieces i probably wouldnt have noticed that my waist size permanently increased by a couple of inches as i went into my 20s if i didnt own some tiny oldschool skirts i budget ok outside of lolita but it normalised me spending huge amounts on clothes i could never have justified to myself otherwise
  take a look through any lolita thread if it doesnt become apparent then youre either blind or in denial yourself
i dont know how to truly feel about it i like how it hides my disgraceful body cottage cheese pancake asssmall boobsno hips and gives it a beautiful silhouette but my face isnt something i can hide and no matter how i try to get better at makeupit seems to look older/weirder whenever i apply some on and obviously im also ugly without i also feel more pressured by aging at 23 i already feel like i look haggard and should stop sweet  ive always been self conscious about my weight even if its skinny by us standards and i fit older pieces without much trouble as well but whenever my old school pieces feel snug i feel like im gross  i also compare myself to other girls a lot but thats something i do out of lolita as well     although it made me realize i could look like what i always dreamed to look like even though i havent been blessed with a gorgeous face and body
  im the same as you anon im 23 and i feel old i see under eye lines and nasolabial folds forming i have no tits no ass and i have a disgusting fridge body so lolita helps me hide i feel good in the fashion but arent i just using it to hide
  maybe you just focus on the negatives not to say that this board is sunshine and rainbows but i gloss over the shitposts and petty drama and i see plenty of discussion about the fashion and gulls helping each other out in the general coord help threads stupid question threads and so on
  the most active threads are the ones where ppl are shit on not hard to see this as negative
  if everyone hated lolita that much why would anyone wear it there are other far more affordavle communities to get a drama fix
  thats how i feel  i might be way too harsh on myself because according to my familyfriends and girlfriend i look amazing and cute and i have a nice body even though its average  i actually feel worse in lolita than in normier clothes because it attracts more attention and since im anxious it makes me feel even worse and uglier  at home i just feel so pretty and confident but if i go outside after a few minutes my confidence fades away
  again that sounds like a you problem maybe if you stopped looking in the ita thread youll see that not everyone is here to stir shit
  the thread is asking about how the fashion makes you feel not how the community makes you feel its entirely possible to wear the fashion and not partake in drama theres literally nothing you can do in this world that doesnt come with the baggage of some bad apples are you really so selfabsorbed that you cant consider that maybe just maybe there are girls on this board that wear lolita because they love how it looks and it makes them feel powerful
    imagine /cgl/ being a board full of individual people with different thoughts feelings and experiences who are consequently drawn to different types of threads and make different types of posts    impossible /cgl/ is a hivemind of people that all have the same negative thoughts and all gravitate to the same threads and say the same shit day after day we are the borg    thinking of us as being anything else is ridiculous
   maybe one way to look at it is to think historically lolita is based on victorian fashion and if you look back at old photo plates there are lots of women who dont have ideal facial features but they still look beautiful in the clothes of the time because the clothing was beautiful and did make them look more beautiful
  nasolabial folds  nice one anon
  the community is part of the fashion you can both feel good wearing it but hate the salt that some people give you for it just like how you can hate the attention you get or the pictures from randoms
  of course you can no one said otherwise and no a lonelita does not have to be part of any community i can collect pokemon cards without being part of the pokemon community
i have terrible self esteem it has gotten better in the last few years but its still pretty low however i would largely attribute the improvement to lolita    like many others in the thread i have improved my selfcare routine and started to play less attention about what others think of me     i am happy i got into the fashion overall however my impulsive buying problem has gotten worse
  this  i feel that lolita makes me look extra bulky as i walk ive never been looking too elegant while walking even in casual clothes a lot of people told me i look like a soldier because i run fast and move my hands too intensly when i wear voluminous clothes it feels like my petti gets messed with my legs my walk looks extra awkward and everyone makes fun at me
  lolita makes me feel beautiful because i realize my beauty ideals come from my childhood storybooks and dolls which all featured the victorian and rococo motifs that inspire the fashion   headtotoe details galor lace curls big skirts ribbons dainty shoesi was ambling towards these things even before i officially found lolita the fullon subculture i found bits and pieces of what i didnt know was gothic lolita through a uk gothic clothing site     lolita is definitely part of my self care but i also feel like i give to the world around me when i step out in it people love the whimsy and the wackiness of it it makes folks smile and seems to invigorate them older women ask me to twirl sometimes i always make a warm new acquaintance when im in lolita and it feels good to relate to others through this hobby of mine    alternatively being a seagull has been rough on the esteem at times and i constantly battle with becoming a judgey salt mine that hates my weight i am a lonelita though so hopefully one day i can live in a bigger town and be part of a comm and get some inperson lolita interaction and real perspective  i used to not be as insecure about my fat now im trying to lose weight and it isnt even for me its for other people i should probably talk to a professional about this before this gets out of hand god forbid    tldr lolita is the best thing ever and makes me feel like the beautiful maiden i want to be but /cgl/ culture has exploded some insecurities and sometimes mucks the positives
  nayrt but all memes aside they really are the bane of young faces and theyre impossible to work around unlike blemishes or eyebrows they just hold your looks back theyre really relevant in lolita because they can ruin baby faces that work so well in the fashion
i always had a bad self image issue i had eating disorders growing up and everyone always preyed on the fact i felt masculine and made fun of me for it for the longest time i was only allowed to wear pants and tshirts so being an adult and being able to dress myself and wear stuff that makes me not feel dysphoric has been so wonderful it also helps with my gender dysphoria too honestly as a nonbinary fem my ruffles have brought me more confidence and a better overall self image of myself now im unapologetically a high femme i look cute i feel cute and im happy for the first time in my life
  theyre really relevant in lolita because they can ruin baby faces that work so well in the fashion  unless youre into the subversive aspect of the fashion and wear whatever substyle you like regardless few things are more subversive than wearing sweet in your 30s especially if you dont look as young anymore because you love it and you dont care for peoples opinions within the fashion or otherwise
lolita motivated me to finally lose the extra 30 pounds i had been carrying around throughout college and keep it off so yeah i would say it has helped my self image in that respect it also motivates me to get dressed put on a bit of makeup and fix my hair every day despite crippling depression so another self esteem boost from that    on the other hand my so claims to be accepting of it but is actually embarrassed to be seen in public with me when i wear it which has definitely hurt my self esteem because i basically can only wear it at home now when i used to wear it everywhere all the time ive complained about him before on here    but then again im also having an affair with a super hot metalhead with nice abs who loves lolita and isnt embarrassed by me in the slightest so jokes on so i guess
  its mixed i have paid more attention to how i look and i try to take better care of myself but its also made me extremely conscious of how short and boxy i am part of it is being overweight part of it is knowing that no matter how much weight i lose hats will never fit my large head rings and bracelets dont squeeze over my wide hands and fingers and on top of that ive become hyper aware of my fingers being shorter than average too i know big boned is an excuse fat people use but i literally have wide feet sizing wide hips a thick skull and wide fingers/hands lolita kind of makes me hate my self image even though i love the fashion so so much but i suppose cosplay and normie fashion was already pushing me in that direction anyway my only grace is ive got almost no tits so as i lose the weight dresses will fit me better i just feel like a troll sometimes though
  i also have a wider frame and i promise you that losing weight will help all of those things fit except for hats the fat will come off as you lose weight even on the bony feeling areas you dont think have much fat like your ribcage i used to be fat so i know
  most lolitas are doing fine without participating in the online community my local comm has over 20 active members and ive only seen 3 of them share coords online
  having an affair  youre gross and i hope he burns all of your brand you disgusting whore  sorry you cant get over your so being embarassed that you probably dress like a giant toddler or something but cheating is just plain disgusting
  you fucking deserve to have a shitty so that makes you feel like shit and hurts your self esteem doesnt matter how physically attractive you are youre a disgusting piece of shit
  this gave me good feels
when i was younger i used to get made fun of for being so short and skinny i also have a baby face and im often mistaken for being much younger than i actually am i found myself getting angry trying to fit into normal fashion because everything is made for tall people and i look wrong in sexier fashions lolita made me feel like i found something that was made for me its the only time i really feel cute even though i know im not actually attractive when i wear it i can look in the mirror and actually like myself a little
  thats a very sweet way of seeing it anon  t classic lolita who adore the victorian era      if its even true i hope youll get double dumped thats all you deserve
  thank you this is encouraging ive lost 5 lbs so far in the past month but the coming holidays are super daunting and ive got to steel myself to make it through them it always ruins my progress    im mourning so many hats though
  i was on board until the cheating shame on you anon
  hypocritical maleposter strikes again  nayrt but the majority of yall are whores so    i am not down with cheating in the slightest but your post was ott af
lolita helped me lose weight improve my appearance overall etc but most of all the lolita lifestyle i adopted has had a huge impact on my life     a big part of my beginnings in lolita was discovering the princess portal many years ago i know a lot of people have various opinions of it and thats completely fine looking back a lot of the stuff is maybe silly compared to how we view the fashion now but it inspired me hugely i started to feel like it was worth being good to myself treating myself special like a princess whatever that may mean to anyone  i dont live surrounded by fresh flowers and porcelain dolls but i started to really care about myself i made time to do nice things i was a loner so id often feel like complete shit because i didnt have friends to do things with so i started doing things on my own instead of wishing and upsetting myself i plucked up the courage to go to cool museum exhibits the cinema shopping all alone it was liberating   id take time once a week to wear something nice make a pot of tea have it from a nice teacup and have a dainty breakfast or lunch i know it sounds silly but id never done anything like that for myself before i never thought it was worth the effort it made me feel really special   it wasnt all rainbows i still suffered from anxiety and depression and couldnt always do nice things but it broke the clouds a little just enough     i just started willing myself to do nice things for myself im not saying id still be helplessly depressed if id never found the fashion but it definitely helped    this was all before joining a community and since i joined a community its just gotten better and better ive made so many friends who i never wouldve met otherwise casual friends and close lifelong friends they are some of the greatest gifts this fashion could ever have given me
before lolita i was fairly lame i didnt care about how i looked or how i smelled or what others thought of me i believed i was destined to be mediocre and not worth anyones attention    when i found lolita i started to take care of myself and i established a hygiene and beauty routine my hair looks better and my skin is clear i know how to do makeup and how to pick good products    i realized that i am a good height and shape and i have been working on toning my body for better mobility i have lost 50lbs so far and i would like to lose 15 more through exercise i do have problems seeing myself as attractive with the extra weight i am still carrying but when im dressed up im cute    my lolita purchasing experience has helped me to build a decent normie wardrobe with good quality clothing that suits my body no more bad fast fashion fabrics and no more illfitting pants and tops     with people noticing me and people wanting to be my friend i have become more confident i am no longer the strange reclusive kid i have realized that i am able to talk to others and make friends easily    lolita has made me critical of how i treat others too i still dislike repugnant permaitas though i am more thoughtful about how much effort i put in to criticizing them i am getting better at handling ugly thoughts and noticing when i am feeling sour and judgy for no good reason     overall lolita gave me a toolkit of skills that has improved my whole life
  im a girl but aight senpai  majority of yall are whores  explain if youre talking about those idiots talking about whoring themselves out for cosplay or brand 80 of them are memeing and the 20 left lacks serious self respect    if you cheat you are absolute scum and you deserve bad things for being a bad person no matter how ott this might make me look thats just how i think desu
  dont think im unattractive i just genuinely dont know what i look like and what if anything is appealing  same
  exactly i never questioned it before i felt fine how i was but the regulations of this fashion and the online community has made my image plummet i still wear it because i enjoy the fashion in general and recognize this newfound self hatred is a personal problem unrelated to the clothes themselves
  this is really sweet i am really happy especially for the little things like tea and a nice lunch for yourself i used to hate cooking and not see the point but take joy in baking now when i make things for myself i wouldnt get to have otherwise i dont think its silly at all its important to treat yourself right
  yeah because theres no community outside of this board and the fashion doesnt exist outside of the internet people have different experiences with lolita than just this and i hope someday you do too
  well outside of lolita i still generally dont look great i try to wear good quality clothing that fits me though and dont buy fast fashion but ive tried to take better care of my hair at least    this is shameful but i used to have awful acne and what actually motivated me to get rid of it was a crush on some dude i took medication to get rid of it and now my skincare routine is to keep it from coming back     in work i look pretty mediocre just jeans and shirts sometimes mildly frilly blouses but not lolita ones im thinking now that maybe i will try to wear more otomeinspired stuff to work retail    regarding my body image im tallish 178cm/510 and never had a problem with that but its annoying for fitting into lolita i hover between 130 and 140lbs and still have difficulty fitting into things lolita is the only reason ive ever actually avoided putting on weight sometimes ive needed to put on weight for health when ive been skinny lolita is the only reason ive ever felt fat at 130lbs and 510    but overall it makes me feel prettier better about myself more feminine i never really felt feminine outside of lolita always this kind of butch person the one who carries heavy things for others opens jars reaches things on shelves before i grew my hair for lolita people couldnt tell if i was male or female and i didnt care i still dont think i would care if someone mistook me for a man but now at least i can take some joy in looking feminine and pretty
this is probably going to be a ramble i met one of my best friends through lolita and id never give it up for the world i love the way it makes me feel when i wear it like im actually feminine and fierce as all fuck ive learned how to make jewellery and style wigs and create accessories its done so much good for me    but there have been some negative aspects no matter how much weight i lose ill always be too tall like other anons in this thread i got into it when i was a skelly teen and its hard to come to terms with the fact that i dont have that body type anymore  i always think well if i was wearing normie stuff right now i wouldnt be too tall but thats not true  im still not the right height for things to fall as they should on me lolita kind of helped with that feeling even though i began to hate my height a couple of years ago because of it  earlier this year i just kind of thought fuck it im going to wear what i like regardless of whatever people think its the same mantra i use when people think im weird for wearing lolita so by that extension i shouldnt care whether someone wearing the same fashion as me thinks im weird either no ones opinions matter or everyones opinions matter and i prefer living by the former   also baby and aatps low waist cuts actually look great on me im proud to say fuck it everyone should be able to admit when they look good  its made me way more ballsy probably a wee bit too ballsy but id rather be able to stand up for myself than not     tldr to my weird rant i love lolita and i love being a lanky weirdo in frills
  ok seriously even kids have nasolabial folds they really dont matter that much unless you look like youre thinking negative thoughts and worrying    seriously i think one of the biggest factors in looking young is just coming off as a positive person no one cares about wrinkles or folds if youre smiling happy and friendly
positives  as someone thats always been interested in art and design but had no direction since gaining an interest in lolita and fashion in general i really feel like i found myself i used to give zero shits about my appearance but now know the strengths in my small size and appearance i used to dream of being tall and sexy because thats whats desired in the west but now being called elvish or cute or being told i have tiny hands feels good   negatives  i never had an issue with my weight until i got into lolita ive always been average weight with a high metabolism and i consider myself extremely lucky to have never been actually overweight but its just not enough for me anymore i dont even have a particularly large bust but im still regularly susceptible to boobloaf and nearly all my weight gets put on at my hips thighs and lower stomach not even my ass  i started doing dance for excercise and it hasnt done much rather than ruin my waistline by strengthening the muscles there i feel like im on the verge of anorexia also i hate how my bitch ass genetics gave me a long nose minimal chin and thin hair
lolita made me feel miserable idk if its either femininity or the fact it looks childish to a lot of people i dont feel people treat me serious they rather see me as some kind of cute little girl that must listen to whatever adults say
  body image issues    ayrt i did have some when i started i worried i wasnt thin enough and in the last 3 years ive went from a 90cm bust to 95 70 cm waist to 75 but at the same time i have a fully brand wardrobe im so incredibly proud of and happy with i realize im not skinny by any stretch of the imagination but lolita has made me more mindful of healthy eating and wearing things that fit and flatter my body type     i get genuinely sad when people say they are too big when really theyre a healthy size maybe a little softer than that but not massive i wish we didnt equate lolita to a stick thin curveless figure but i also feel thats only thought by those not super involved with the fashion yet thats an outsiders point of view
  same as me anon even now i get mistaken as a middle schooler and being short doesnt help im glad lolita makes you like yourself  even if its by a little
  i dont think im unattractive i just genuinely dont know what i look like and what if anything is appealing  i continue to be uncertain as to whether i am cute or not  while i think my hair is pretty nice i dont know if anything else about me is really that suitable for lolita  damn you put into words how i feel whenever i try to explain to people that i dont know what i look like people look at me like i have three heads i look into the mirror and see my face but i have no idea if its attractive or not in one second of looking at myself i can watch my face go from pretty cute to mexican maid lady to cute to weird old cat lady even now its hard to put into words but yeah the best way i can explain it is that i cant figure out how i look or how clothes look on me
  thats all your fault  anon
  you should add a devil may care attitude to your coords
  im the same way i really miss being able to buy at physical shops because i used to rely a lot on trying something on and asking the staff and a friend how it looks on me
i think lolita has definitely helped my selfimage i have terrible acne and proper makeup has taken me from hating pictures to wanting them taken its also allowed me appreciate being short and having feminine features im a guy i really never cared about fashion until i got into egl either now ive learned the joys of making a coord ive been blessed with a good comm and made a few friends i maintain a small social media presence with other lolitas/oujis and everyones very nice which is a good selfesteem boost more than anything lolita lets me be myself instead of pretending to be a normie
i criticize my looks constantly but since getting into lolita that has gotten worse im constantly worried if im too tall too fat unnattractive in general since getting into it and im in the process of losing weight which is v stressful so i can fit pieces better and feel dainty and elegant but besides that i love this fashion so much and when i wear lolita i truly feel like this is who i really am and that my personality matches my outward appearance
  anon if you feel the need to cheat then you are obviously not happy with your so and you need to just end it with him even if hes embarrassed of going into public with you being in a relationship with him at least entitles him to some respect and honesty youd want the same from him maybe he doesnt give you the respect and honesty you deserve  all the more reason to end it with him    i dont mean to lecture because youre a grownass adult but its unfair to both of you both to deprive yourself of someone who will enjoy being in public with you when youre in lolita because its important to you and to deprive him of being honest and straightforward about the situation    i dont know what your aim is or if youre hoping that hell catch you cheating so you have an excuse to break up but i think youre better than this im sorry about your depressioni hope things get better for you
  gulls helping each other out in the general  calling someone a new fag is soooo helpful      enough with your not me horse shit i never said anything about this place being a hivemind just that the lolita side of the board ive seen the past 3 years is nothing like the happy go lucky bs at the beginning of this thread sorry but i dont believe the girls who post here are actually happy with their lives and ok with themselves ive met the types that come to this board and this site in general theres something off about them aside from the people larping here its mostly inept individuals with inflated egos
  i feel the same way anon i hate the online community so much but i just cant look away
  i never said anything about this place being a hivemind  no but you did just say that everyone that comes here is inept and has an inflated ego some anons are like this obviously and theyre also the ones who continuously post memes like  lurk moar newfag  sorry you got posted  etc theyre not the ones who actually contribute to healthy discussions which do happen here believe it or not   but again this is what you choose to see and if anything it says a lot about you than anyone else whos been posting in this thread why do you keep coming here if you hate it so much
  its mostly bitter fucks like you that contribute to how awful this board can be youre probably one of those anons that constantly shit on other people because youre unhappy with yourself and therefore see this board as a safehaven for autists like you so when you see people here enjoying themselves and having a generally positive experience it flies in the face of your perception of the board and the normalicy of your behaviour in general
        i dont really know to feel about this since i feel like ive improved with the help of those threads i just look at all the things other people are doing wrong and make sure i dont repeat those mistakes    i mean sure clearing your acne or losing weight is something you gotta work towards and nothing really fixes unfortunate genetic lottery but most of the girls that end up being shat on in those threads dont actually look genetically ugly they end up there because theyre wearing ugly or mismatched things have bad grooming skills dont fit their clothes or are fat and most of these things are fixable although losing weight does take a longer time to fix than others    i find hugboxes to be downright detrimental like i could put on a dress and if nobody tells me its ugly i dont know if i actually look okay or theyre just being politically correct i always feel deep down they think its ugly they just dont tell me so it doesnt help with sparing my feelings and i never really get better at not looking like a walking disaster    so yes lolita did pretty much help me dress better take better care of myself and feel better that i take better care of myself i dont think thats completely at odds with the ita thread existing
  youre so friggin sensitive get over yourself  youre literally whining about trolls who hurt your feelings if your skin is this thin maybe dont visit 4chan like this place isnt that important that you need to subject yourself to us meanies  its your choice
  honestly the best way to cope with that is making sure youre wearing pieces that flatter your current figure i use a loose corset and/or chest binder to get the proper silhouette but otherwise this is just a fashion there shouldnt be horrible pressure on you to change yourself for a dress just change the dress for your body type
  id love to see examples of the pleasant conversations youre referencing like outside of the b/s/t and dream dress threads and even those threads are filled with trolls and shit stirrers im glad you can be positive and see things in an optimistic light but at the same time youre overlooking all the negativity which outweighs the positive on this board      for autists like you  hmm no i also never accuse people of being autistic when thats literally not something you can tell from talking to anonymous strangers but you just keep on memeing because my observation bothered you cant think of any other reason youd hop on the typical autism 4chan insult are you sure you dont shit up the board by calling people autists      i think you could have probably learned those things without negativity just the same thats all im saying im glad for you though     hopefully youre also a better person mentally now and realize you dont need unnecessary criticism in your life       i dont even know what youre talking about to the point where im not even sure if you meant to reply to me no one hurt my feelings i do know some girls who come to this board and there is really no other way to describe it other than something is off about them i really cant say much more with out giving away who they are which is why im not going into detail but it had nothing to do with me i just met them and was nice to them now i dont hang out with them has nothing to do with me being sensitive no idea why you assume this
id say lolita has brought both negative and positive things into my life but mostly positive really    the negative part is that it has made me very self conscious of my appearance ive always been on the chubbier side but i never cared much about it until i got into lolita sometimes i just feel like im too big for this fashion even if im not even plus size in western sizes and it sucks im not saying i cant find things that fit most of my wardrobe is brand but i just feel like i dont look nearly as good as skinnier lolitas it doesnt help that ive been stress eating and gaining weight recently it makes me feel so gross and i have a fear that i might grow so big someday i actually wont fit my brand pieces it probably sounds dumb as fuck but its my biggest issue with lolita really    other than that and the reason why i fear outgrowing my lolita pieces so much is because i fucking love this fashion even if it makes me feel self conscious from time to time when i look at myself at a mirror in a full coord i feel so special and elegant like no other clothing piece could make me feel i just love covering my surroundings of cute sweet and beautiful things and for me this fashion is one of the most beautiful things i have ever found and i am so grateful that i am able to partake in it it has made me grow a huge appreciation for more historical fashion styles and ignited my love for rococo art and aesthetics it has also empowered me to try new things and do the things that i want and not what everyone else expects of me sure i still get nervous when i go out in frills but once im outside i become more confident and sure of myself
i was an anachan when i started lolita so i fit perfectly into everything i wanted     now im finally at a normal weight and i hate it because i get boobloaf and i despise my thicker thighs because im 58 and i think it just makes my ap shit look like ageplay i still love and adore sweet but i hate the way i look in it in terms of body shapethough i love everything else     im thinking of trying more elegant styles in brands with longer waists because of my height/boobs the waist of all my beloved 2010 era ap hits me like two inches above my actual waist i just think that as much as i love super sweet shit its not meant for me
  nayrt yall so damn catty on this damn site its clear most lolitas have insecurities that cause them to want to talk shit about other people constantly
  nayrt but handmade threads and even draw threads are quite positive self post threads and waywt threads used to be quite good but now we rarely have them just hide the bad threads thats what i do
this thread made me want to wear lolita so bad but i have work today thanks anons ill wear it on my next day off for sure
im not a lolita but i wear a variety of other jfashion styles like fairy kei himekaji etc     i started wearing these styles in high school i am 52 and have remained in the same ball park throughout my life in terms of weight 110114 lbs and i wont lie i really didnt think too much about how my body looked until i started wanting to buy brand i had this desire to finally step into the jfashion community after being an outsider admiring other people for so long    im a college student now and i can say jfashion has been both positive and detrimental to my mental health at the same time i definitely take better care of myself than i have for most of my life i exercise several times a week and im very critical about what i eat however its left me feeling paranoid about how my body appears and its gotten to the point that i avoid scales because i dread seeing whatever number pops up when i stand on them the rational side of my brain says its not that big of a deal and im being stupid i know im not a landwhale and am at the average healthy weight and shape for my height but it can be defeating when a skirt that fit me just right one week feels a little snug the next am i going to go full anachan for the clothes no but i still feel envy seeing girls more petite than i am looking better in the styles i like although looking good is subjective being a little heavier or skinnier doesnt influence your ability to coord despite everything i could never give up wearing jfashion as its become a pretty integral part of my identity
    i hate to say it but while ive read all the newbie guides on how to dress nothing really beats seeing someone doing it wrong and realising it does look like shit or seeing someone do all the right things and still look like shit and then some anon comes along and explains it maybe you dont count this as a positive interaction but i find it useful to analyze why a coord doesnt work so i can learn from it    plus theres all the times itas themselves come into threads and despite being told its futile to pick a fight again another interaction i count as positive as this is often solid advice start arguing that they arent ita  and meanwhile their picture is right there most times they do indeed look like bad thats when i realised ano one cares for excuses byou cant argue youre pretty when youre ugly not when your photo is right there cyoure not actually fighting back the bullies you just look like an insane dumbass deep in denial especially when all the flaws are fixable things like better shoes or better makeup or something these arent things you can learn from a guide you realise it when you see someone actually fuck up in a thread meltdown    as for being in a better place mentally ive had people pick on my shoes for being ugly but i acknowledge that yeah some of my orthopedic shoes are indeed ugly as fuck and i dont spend that much of my life obssessing over anons who took five seconds to comment ugly shoes i dont know if thats being a better person mentally now or unnecessary criticism its just seeing so many breakdowns on the ita thread i realise its kinda pointless and easier to let it pass    i do wish the itas the best but having seen some of the bullheaded ones i dont know sometimes its their own bed and you cant help them only learn from their mistakes other times its nice to see people actually improve after being posted
i got fatter after discovering lolita i can kinda see why it was/is a fat girl fashion in japan  i might be an xs in the west because i have a relatively small frame but im a ml in most east asian countries and lolita is pretty forgiving compared to fitted skirts and jeans when you gain 34kg thankfully i discovered it as an adult so im not having any crises of not being in my 14yearold body but its not great for my waistline i still love it though  japanese altfashion was one of the first times i saw street fashion that i felt i could actually copy because it was on body types that looked a bit like mine
   i think you could have probably learned those things without negativity just the same thats all im saying im glad for you though     moreover its not like everyone needs to be improved people might do a couple of coords then drop it all and sell everything out is it so necessary to force them
  i agree the ita thread taught me how to coordinate when i was a noob i went through every pic until i could consistently figure out what was wrong with each one or what wasnt
    lmao how are anons forcing randoms to improve if you want to improve then improve if you only want to do two coords sell everything and leave then do your two coords sell everything and leave whats stopping you the imaginary 4chan lolita police at your doorstep
  i really do mean how the people are here and how they act yes there is positive stuff on the board but it is few and far between there are a lot of people coming here who arent just trolling theyre just people who are off mentally and they really are lolitas that go to meet ups  i have every reason to be skeptical of the positive stuff posted on 4chan cause this site is built off lies its one of the many negative past times that anons love so much
  you just look like an insane dumbass deep in denial  dear god anon you let larpers and trolls who only know how to call something they dont like cheap invade your brain and now youre a better lolita    yea man you are deeply insane
  okay but what makes you think the experiences and feelings posted in this thread are all lies as was said upthread the fashion exists outside of the internet and i have no doubt that its had a positive influence on the girls posting in this thread as it has for me
  if you only look for the negative in life thats all that youll find try hiding the negative threads anon it also helps to ignore bait but gulls have a hard time with this
  youre being baited stupid
  a lot of normal weight girls look super cute in ap even at your height or taller desu super huge skirts look silly with stick legs underneath it looks best with normal not fat legs i say this as an anachan so
  thisand slightly chubby girls are adorable in sweet not overweightjust on the bigger end of average weight
  reading this made me feel bitter sweet happy i wish you the best anon
am writing this from my psychiatrists waiting room  i had to pull out of lolita around 2012 because along with my then mostly untreated mental illnesses and anorexia it was really affecting my self image especially bodywise negatively id obsess over becoming thinner than i already was over being perfect and pretty over how others in my comm would percieve me  in the years since ive gotten on meds done several years of therapy and this spring gone inpatient for three months now that i am much more stable im beginning to dip my toe into it again very careful about what content i consume etc so it doesnt affect me negatively again its still a struggle not to slip back into old habits but im taking my time and taking care of myself
positives    i feel great about my clothes coming into it from the goth side of things makes me feel a lot fancier than whatever band tee i could through on before i left the house wearing all black has also been an excuse to keep from learning how to match and coord clothes well since ive gotten into lolita and aristo ive found it helps me feel and look better even in my trad goth outfits the fashion also gives me an opportunity to make friends im content working at getting a good wardrobe together before i actually talk with anyone in a comm but i like knowing that once im better i can have people to talk with about skirt releases and if a shirt if work buying or not    negatives    i never considered myself fat before getting into this fashion im average if a tad chubby in the west and now im so preoccupied about loosing weight often ineffectually that its started eating other parts of my personality i hardly feel like i can cook any more despite the feeling that it was the one thing i was good at im also one of those people with self control problems meaning im always out of money when i see something i like and get frustrated when i cant afford it i admit its my fault but its still a damper on my day i also keep buying clothes despite having more than enough normie clothes already      you can always try attaching a ribbon to the inside of the hat and tying hte ribbon under your chin of at the nape of your neck if your outfit doesnt work with a visible ribbon all you have to do is slide it under your hair or put your hat on as part of your hair styling so you can work around it  a hat loving anon      cheating  just dump him and be done with it      you and telephonecan are the best part of the lolita half of cgl desu      join me in aristo its a more mature look and helps with getting more respect
  honestly stop looking at /cgl/ if you are vulnerable this isnt someplace you should be post to fb where its all positive or lj where no one will even notice you posting
  nah i know which threads not to look at and that i can just turn off the computer if anything gets to me its exposure therapy lite
  as someone who went through similar thingsi feel you anon you can make it im sure youll be a very pretty lolita and that you are pretty as it is keep on working on yourselfit pays off
without well coordinated pretty clothes on i just feel like a very unsightly awkward body my posture is not great and the same goes for my face and hair but apart from this i think lolita fashion suits me most clothes suits me though im thin i genuinely enjoy the fashion but sometimes i think without clothes i wouldnt have self esteem at all
  if nothing else ive become a better seamstress that alone has made it all worth it
    serious question do you guys dress in the style outside of your personal life/events im into jfashion but never bring it into my professional life because it would affect others opinions of me doing well at my job is what allows em to pursue it in the first place so id never do anything that would cause higher ups to look down on me i was into lolita in 20062010 but would only dress up for events i was a teenager back then and handmade everything so it was a little different
  im so glad im self employed
  woa girl that sounds like a dream show us your purple card and your new lamborghini hon bossbabe
  now im less glad im self employed because it led me to you and your comment
  ive worn it to a few jobs before the place im at right now would be totally fine with it ive just been too lazy and dont have much that works for daily wear anymore sold all of my sweet and basically have to start over from scratch lmfao rip     the places ive worked at that allow it though are creative jobs ie costume shops and fashion stores so i do hear of some lolitas who wear really toned down lolita to company meetings etc but you dont hear of it very often
  imagine being this mad about other peoples lives if a man berates you you owe him nothing shes probably prepping to leave  enjoy being undesirable    leave him as soon as you can a man embarrassed to be seen with you doesnt deserve you you have to treat your presence as a privilege not a right  but also affairs are bad fix your shit girl    as for me lolita made me feel more like myself/ more like who im supposed to be i had always been super feminine growing up which always felt in direct contrast to my nerdy/otherwise nonfeminine interests lolita makes me feel like i can have it all i can look and feel like a princess while blasting metal on the way to my job as a software dev and still reasonably fit the spirit of the fashion  lolitas at least in my corner of the world also seem to be relatively betteradjusted than the cosplay community its nice feeling like im hanging out with other adults rather than people continually somehow having crisis after crisis that is most likely regional however a lot of the cosplay community up here are uwu tumblr types a lot of my lolita friends also use /cgl its just fun to laugh at the drama from afar    as for self image ive felt like i have to strive to match the clothes that i love so much ive always been tall but petite and my tastes unshirred older classic brands are a good barometer to keep my weight in check lolita did give me the final push i needed to get a breast reduction that i had been contemplating for nearly a decade of shoulder pain so that was also nice my biggest insecurity at the moment is my hair i have a lot of it but its pretty straight and its a challenge to get the volume id like with it as a result
  ntayrt but why are you defending having an affair
    i feel like if you actually wore jfashion like you say you wouldnt actually need an answer to this question
  rip the bandaid off coward cheating is unkawaii
  no because work involves body fluids and is in a medical laboratory my coworkers who know about it dont seem to look down on me for it
  not a lolita but a nanchatte and years of cgl and seeing nanchatte irl here in japan has made me feel fat and like im made of cottage cheese my tits are sagging and my face is lumpy and my nasal labial lines will never go away i look different in every picture and constantly ask my friend which one looks like me irl
have you ever happened to drastically ruin your brand for the halloween eve tell the scariest horror stories that happened to your pretty possessions
once i spilled red kool aid on my dreaming macaron skirt which is yellow i got it mostly out but the stain is faintly there
very minor horror story but ive broken this ring twice which sucks because lolita designers love sticking crosses on everything so its easy to match with i snagged it and broke it bought another one and broke that one a few months later then they stopped selling it all my other rings are fine this one is cursed
tried taking this vm op from white to ivory and this was the result of the first attempt    luckily i lifted most of this out to a pink based ivory but i did a lot of crying laughter of disbelief until then
once i tried to remove a stain from my etc bag with alcohol but little did i know alcohol melts vegan leather so i ended up with even bigger nasty blob it was heartbreaking experience especially since initial spot was barely noticeable
left my precious ap heart bag hanging on my door hook with the rest of my bags didnt realize all the weight of the bags were on the ap bags strap   after a month or to i decided to re arrange my bags when i pulled the heart bag off last a whole chunk of the pleather on the strap stuck to the hook and came clean off  it was already peeling slightly before but now its super noticeable  im devastated because its my favorite bag
  it doesnt look too bad
  wow mine broke off too and i lost it currently hunting for it again
  thats a nice colour tho
i was on acid and playing in my dresses and as i was tying my waist ties i hear a pop and the button not just came out but the fabric anchor behind it popped out as well now my sugar fairy cake has a large hole in the side of it
  luckily these are fairly easy to find secondhand and not super expensive if i recall correctly ill bet youll be able to replace it anon  im sorry this happened to you though i wish these bags were made from sturdier material id happily pay the higher cost for it too
  its happened to me twice where ive busted the zippers on baby dresses and baby only its an easy fix but its annoying outside of that i do try and be careful with my items
im probably gonna out myself for telling this story but its been long enough that i dont think anyone is angry anymore though i could be wrong lol for me its something i look back on and cringe now but im not really mad anymore    a few years ago i got together with a couple of friends to go shopping i wore my milky berry jsk in white and coordinated it with mostly white items blouse socks etc wed been at the mall for about an hour when one of my friends ran into her very normie sisterinlaw who was shopping with her 2ishyearold sonmy friend was clearly embarrassed to see her so the rest of us kind of kept our distance and continued shopping nearby at some point the boy who obviously wasnt being watched closely wandered over to us and was super curious about everything in that rough little boy way like yanking on another girls usakumya and getting upset when he couldnt play with it we started leading him back to his mom when something else caught his attention and he started to run the other way so i quickly grabbed his hand to stop him from getting to far and he started to scream now that it was suddenly a big scene his mom and my friend started walking our way but he was in full tantrum mode by the time they came over and had flopped on the floor kicking at me and hand managed to yank my petticoat part of the way down in the process i stepped away to fix it while the others explained what happened and his mom halfheartedly scolded him and then she picked him up to come over and apologize to the nice girl still sniffling and pouting he tried to wriggle out of his moms arms and flopped back like they dowhen he suddenly sat up and got super still 1/2
  this sticky little boy then vomited what i later learned was half a bottle of pedialyte and some mac and cheese down the front of my white jsk and of course with it being milky berry this was the point of no return his mother and everyone else in the group was mortified and we made our way to the closest restroom to try and clean up what we could on both him and mebut i was really only concerned with getting the chunks off so i could drive him with a tiny bit of dignity because i knew the jsk was ruined   after apologizing about 600 times his mom started insisting that she replace the dress which i wasnt eager to discourage in the momentbut knowing how shed gag at the price i tried to tell her that they dont make that dress anymore and finding another one would be too much trouble etc etc when she pulled out her checkbook and insisted i tell her the retail price i finally gave her a hard number and thats when shit got heated she looked at the dress looked at my friend scoffed at all of us and was suddenly furious that i was using this as an excuse to scam money because theres no way in hell it would cost that much to dress up like strawberry shortcake my friend tried to pull up a sale post on her phone to show her i wasnt just making up a number but she wanted nothing to do with it she grabbed her kid and left after telling us we were all disgusting and should be embarrassed for so many reasons so the insult to injury so to speak was really the nail in the coffin for me and by the time i got home i just took the jsk off and threw it in the trash if id been thinking clearly at the time i probably wouldve tried salvaging some of the material but it took a long time for me to get over feeling angry every time i saw that print 2/2
  wow that lady was a huge bitch sorry that happened to you
  drive home sorry for typos
  i did it once in my milky planet but it didnt break it luckily
  i would have sent her an invoice in the mail lmao
  i felt terrified just by reading this moreover it happened in public place so theres no way to protect yourself from shit like this
  damn i feel like i remember reading this at one point but seriously what a stupid bitch if shes going to talk all high and mighty about paying you back and chickening out like whats the use of trying to look cool with a checkbook i mean i would have gotten mad too but not enough to throw away the dress probably soak it in stain remover but well it was your dress after all seriously i hate stupid parents who cant take care of their equally stupid kids
  im sure there are probably a lot of stories like this its my first time telling this one here though because i didnt want anyone to think i was trying to bring up old shit or embarrass my friend shes not really into lolita anymore and as far as i know no one active in our old comm knows this story either so i think its okay  milky berry is a no go on soaking because the red is super bad about running the area that got vomited on bled a bit and i had another area on that jsk that bled because i dripped a tiny bit of tea on it so as far as i know there was no hope for it   one thing that really bugs me thinking back on it is that she basically expected us to babysit for her while she talked she watched him come over to us but didnt care enough to do anything about it and she really didnt seem to care that much when he started throwing a tantrum either like you know he was rarely told no at home and a lot of his behavior was probably chalked up to well thats just how little boys are which makes me angry especially since he had been kicking at me too
  whoa what kind of tea did you use  assuming you tea dyed
i got semi drunk at a party with this hairband on and managed to drop it multiple times at one point i realized that the heart had come off my friend luckily found it on the dance floor but in the morning i also found out that 3 of the gems had also disappeared rip
  tbh i actually use replied a bags for this reason  i feel dirty about it but whatever cheap ass pu the make them out of is significantly more durable
  replica bags not replied a
where is iron cover chan in this thread i love that story
i generally take great care of my dresses but ive had bad luck with a few of my daily ones my boyfriend accidentally dyed one pink and just yesterday another got caught in my bike brakes and tore basically im an idiot dating an idiot      oh noooo its a nice colour but im glad you managed to fix it how did you lift the colour
  a waitress once spilled curried squid on my pink fantastic dolly and i had to wash it in the restroom sink after another wash when i got home it actually all came out but that was a horrifying experience
  i hope you got compensated for it wow what an idiot people love to make waiters into holy martyrs that could do no wrong but every waiter ive encountered has been either rude or just straight up not giving a shit after dealing with shitty customers i would be really mad if this happened to me inb4 youre a bad customer nah recently a waiter didnt enter my order when i was out with my boyfriend had to wait 30 minutes for it and he still tipped the guy and i didnt say a word
  maybe if you worked in somewhere like retail or anywhere where you have to deal with the general public you would understand that humanity is shit
  i think i saw your insta story about it lol
  i was thinking of fb actually but who knows could have been a different story  oh god that makes it even more horrifying i hope their stupidity doesnt pass to the kid 
  haha probably now im wondering who you are anon friendo im so sad about my dress looks like im going to have to get it shortened since it cant be patched at least its not a printed dress
  lmao guess what bitch i worked call center for ages im still very polite to my customers and yes i fucking hate the rude ones my point is i hate how waiters are over glorified when really a lot of them are pretty shitty and apathetic
  if its at the hem could it be made into scallops or a bustle
  ooh unfortunately its a very long gothic dress with a chiffon overlay i think scallops might be too sweet for it a bustle would be interesting if it had torn at the back but it tore in a large patch on the side ill ask my tailor though maybe it could be a viable solution thanks for the suggestions
got white pax paint if you dont know what that is its a type of very sticky paint used in sfx makeup made by mixing prosaide a very strong adhesive with acrylic all over the sleeve of an iw blouse that shit does not come out of clothing the blouse honestly didnt fit me well so i wasnt that upset and i purchased it for a specific halloween coordinate i never wore again but i havent tossed it yet its sitting in storage somewhere
  god that sucks can you maybe rip it up or pour more paint on it for a costume or maybe if its long sleeved you could get it made into a short sleeve
  i forgot to mention it was a black blouse i managed to spill on it before i debuted my costume the outfit i was wearing was more of a costume than a coord desu i had on sfx makeup and crazy contacts and shit because halloween so i covered it up with black india ink to make it look passable it is a long sleeve blouse and the cuff and lace where it spilled is now kinda weird and crunchy and a slightly different color from the rest honestly i feel like the style is too mature to look good with short sleeves and it was a little short on me and too tight in the chest i dont even have big boobs iw just makes their blouses for tiny flat chested women so the only thing im actually upset about is that i probably wont be able to sell it now because of the damage i wasnt planning on wearing it again in the first place
my pearl choker from baby broke at a meet thankfully we were able to gather all of the pearls for me to fix it at home
  nope not at all it was an older chinese woman at a dim sum restaurant and she wasnt even apologetic about it lol i really like the food there though so i didnt want to make a big stink about it
i got the hem of a super old dress caught in a fence as i walked by tearing not only the lace but some of the dress it broke my heart and just a few minutes later some crusty old rude woman decided that she absolutely had to know why i was dressed like this and demanded me tell her why when i told her that i just like it she told me i was lying and was being a threatening asshole ho bobbing and weaving and getting overly aggressive i was so not in the mood luckily a stranger got in between us and she started being a bitch to him and he told me to leave thank you kind stranger
  maybe you could have the sleeves removed and wear it under jsks/cardigans
  i like the bruando logo on my bags
  rip milky berry dress
  lol i like being a cheap whore who tries to come off looking brand
  i saw your insta story and came here to mention it im awfully sorry about your dress anon thats a real bummer
  we can all tell
ive worn an older aatp dress to larp in its gotten coffee and fake blood on it so far
  name and shame so this awful parent can get internet hate from raising a child with a personality shitty enough to ruin other peoples day
  i need to get some older cheaper pieces to mosh in i have this old piece i just got in im probably going to go see gif from god in wish my brand luck gulls
  thankfully the gems are a muich easier replacement than the bow you can find the same size gems and put them back in using super glue or uv resin    ive broken the bows off of my ap plastic bracelets and rings and uv resin fixes it right up
i used to have two excentrique dresses they were kind of fugly for lolita but really nice for normie wear because they were made out of nice textured fabric so thats how i still wear one of them to this day    once i was running to a work party and wanted to wear the white dress so i put it on then i put shoes on and was running around like a nut trying to get ready except then as im running i somehow get my heel  caught in the back of the dress i heard a huge rip and with that rip that dress it was a very soft knitted fabric so itd look wonky if i tried to sew that seam up i still sort of regret it to this day oh well at least it was a cheap dress 10 on y auctions    i also have a few holes in the lace of some of my dresses and to this day i have no idea how the hell those holes started im so ashamed because one of the holes is in an mm dress im low key trying to find a replacement before the hole gets bigger
i had just bought an old jetj with thin sewn waist ties it was second hand and it had some stains so i was soaking some spots in oxyclean while the dress was laying on a towel on the floor when i lifted the dress up to look at it i accidentally tore a waist tie straight out because i didnt realize i was stepping on part of the waist tie the force of lifting the dress while simultaneously holding the waist tie down was too much for the old stitching    i actually hate waist ties and only the stitching ripped but not the fabric so it worked out in the end i removed the other waist tie and everything was fine the dress is fine but i still remember the heart dropping feeling of hearing brand tear
  honestly this  like i want to support you ap i really do but half my ap bags fall apart in one use  the other 2 are fine but i have 2 that are super fragile coincidently one of them is the exact same one that anon posted the red heart pochette    my cheap taobao bags and swimmer bags never do this like what the fuck i dont want to pay like 70 for this shit
ive spilled nail glue on a skirt that was impossible to get out  grass stains on a jsk from playing frisbee in lolita  lost two buttons on a jsk from swapping clothes with a guy at a party for some reason  yellow stains on a jsk from drinking and spilling the drink  im a monster
was at a picnic with my ex who was a smoker he stands too close to me with his cigarette and a stray burning flake melts a hole right through my jsk luckily its a pretty small hole and the jsk was polyester so the edges of the hole got sealed by the heat but i was still pretty upset
   calling it vegan leather instead of pu    fucking tumblr
  chinese people not even once
i got hot glue on one of my jetj chiffon dresses when i just quickly tried to fix a brooch that broke into parts th fabric is so thin that it kinda melted and the glue merged with the dress its impossible to get those stains out the stains are only noticable at close range i am still embarrassed to wear the dress though because it kind of looks like cum stains worst mistake of my life
  i had a polka dot btssb salopette i used to wear casually all the time once on the train home after a day of shopping i was testing out the paint markers i had bought in a little notebook as i was bored and when i opened one the lid came off completely and bright pink paint spilled all over the dress the women sitting around me sensed my annoyance for sure as i haphazardly tried to clean it up with a newspaper i probably would have worn it still im an artist so i frequently get little spots of paint and such on my clothes and i feel it adds character though this was a pretty noticeable stain it doesnt really matter for casualand it was a cheap salobut i let a friend borrow it and shes never returned it      sometimes ive had bad days or just plans gone awry in a specific coord so ill wear the coord the next time i go out or something and stuff will go wrong again i swear that coord is cursed until i use the pieces in a different outfit or wait a decent amount of time i know its kindof silly and suspicious
  and stupid as well ugh these blobs are haunting me what was i thinking
  the truth is that im not native speaker so i didnt bother to remember how to spell polyurethane
  i like it when i can tell someone is pretending to be a different anonymous poster to try to make that anonymous poster look bad in the middle of an old thread
  last summer i got a brand new beige innocent world jsk i wear it out in a coord the next day promptly sit on some chewing gum on a public bench should have known better its impossible to get the stuff out ive tried all those little tricks you find on the internet and all those did was ingrain the gum deeper into the dress fabric its a thin cotton and while its not very noticeable it does suck especially since it was nwt
  it was like 5 years ago anon i dont even know her new last name since she got remarried
  i posted that not because i was trying to be her but thats because its what she sounds like
  big disagree there boss
in the park new op new bag new shoes so clean and cute feeling a manky collie dog comes along after getting out of the river  shakes himself off beside me that wouldnt matter but the river is half sludge so he just gets oily dots all over me that dont wash out like fml
  not that anon but how does someone wanting replicas because they want a fake brand logo not scream cheap bitch
  holy fuck this is the literal most terrifying and disgusting thing i have ever read    this is why crotchspawn demon goblins are the scum of the earth and why i flat out ignore them
  oh i think you might have misread something  she said she buys replica bags because of how easily brand bags disintegrate  thats not a price issue thats just like not wanting to have to find a replacement second hand every couple years
  if you follow the post chain she said   i like the bruando logo on my bags    
  thats a person responding to her  it wouldnt make sense if the replica bag girl said that because replica bags dont put the brand logo on which is presumably why that person responded that to her because they want the logo
  i told you then it was setup and look at your stupid ass still believing it
  call center  not the same as face to face cs ive done both youre more disconnected from the customer than you think
  then dont buy brand bags or replicas why is this a hard concept
  thats not what the discussion was about  i agree but thats a separate discussion
kind of not a big deal story now but it was horrifying at the time   a couple years ago i went to this japanese culture night at our local art museum i just got lavender castle mirage op in the mail so of course i was going to wear that later through the night i noticed i got spots of chocolate on my dress i wasnt sure how long the spots had been there i felt embarrassed that people had been taking pictures of me with chocolate spots on my dress i decided to not mess with the spots till i got home i thought they were already set in anyway thanks to the reapplying of shout i managed to get the chocolate stains out
  how big were the stains were they that noticeable
  lmfao i work as a waiter and some of my coworkers are literal scum who get high all shift and barely can handle any customers  i dont work at a shitty place either some waitstaff suck and deserve to get reamed
i have one of the smaller ap heart bags and i left it resting on an ottoman by my bedroom wall anyway the heating in our house gets pretty intense when bedroom doors are left shut and mine was and i came back to realise that a clear file i had blutakked to the wall had pretty much slid down from the wall and landed on the bag which meant that the blutak was resting against it and in the heat sort of half melted onto the bag i tried to sort of remove it but it peels the pu off which would be worse i guess    to be fair that bag is second hand and fairly oldish now and the pu has sort of split along the edges even though i was careful with it and only gave it light use
  wow salt mcgee people can enjoy a story friend
i have an ivory coloured btssb coat its gorgeous and i love it    i wore it on the bus once and i guess there mustve been black ink all over the seat i was sitting in because when i got up i realised there was black stuff all over the sleeve of the coat    managed to get most of it out after many washes but its never gonna be perfect
  no i want to real deal
  yeah people also enjoy reality tv but that doesnt excuse their stupidity
  ntayrt but damn go swish your pettis and take a nap or something
  what to close to home for you
fun story  i was but a wee lass dumb and naive decided to take to the sky in my frills the transportations of london were delayed person under train on my head was a wig with golden curls upon it my beloved moitie headbow the bow was made of gorgeous chiffon and adroned with silver crosses and blue jewels the stress was numbing and my companions had to rush at the airport the queues ran long of with the wig as security was strict i put the ensamble on again tears in my eyes we boarded the plane the two hour flight was like a hurricane once we landed on solid ground again we visited the porcelain throne a relief and to wash of the dried tears on my cheeks i took the bow of my head to release the tension of my tempels walked out of the restroom renewed and calm in the depature hall i realized again the forgotten headbow security was kind enough to let me back in to look and to my horror nowhere to be found  i cried in the carriage the whole ride back home  it was a summer night almost 7 years ago but i still grieve that moitie headbow
  this is sad but hilariously written i love you anon
  trying this hard to be a mean girl   cringe
  was this written by a toddler or do ukfags really talk like this
  alright youve actually rustled my jimmies now    first of all ive never found tina fey to be funny i always hated her even back on snl    secondly that movie is horrendously unfunny no anon im more of a hellraiser fan if i had to compare myself to a cunty character itd be julia gothic and sly as fuck    and i wont be surprised if you dont get the reference youve already made it clear you lack good taste
  wew you sound like a real unique gal there anon
  oh god i have one too and im so scared of this happening just through regular wear its already starting to go a bit greytinged on the sleeves how did you wash it ive never washed a coat at home before idk if dry cleaning would help
  getting this irate on an image board  wew
    ru ok
  hellraiser isnt edgy        typical u mad reply from gulls who dont have anything original to say
i recently got one of my dream dresses in the black colorway since oldschool baby prints are notorious for running in the wash i knew i needed to test the waist ties first before just washing the whole dress so i washed the waist tie the water was definitely black but the excess dye came out easily and didnt stain the light parts of the print i figured i was good to go when the dress needed to be washed    a few weeks go by i wear it a couple times and it needs to be washed i confidently get out my handwashing tub fill it up with cold water and gentle detergent and wash away i assume it is fine    the next day after the dress is dry i go to hang it in my wardrobe the motherfucking print bled i dont even know how i was so careful i even tested it first for fucks sake now i dont know exactly how to go about fixing it and its been keeping me up at night should i just wash it again and rinse it a million times with some color catcher sheets please help kind anons
    i dont know what the fuck youre talking about but you sound like an autist
  i know you dont know what im talking about you dont even know what actual autism is you just spout memes
  my god anon are you me i had an old black baby print bleed dye like a motherfucker when i tried to wash it even though the detachable piece i tested on was fine to the point the water was purple and i legit wondered if the thing had been washed in its 12 year life     as long as you havent done anything to set the dye heat vinegar you should be able to save it there used to be a post on egl where a girl cleared out print bleed with baby shampoo other posts that suggest dylon color run remover the info isnt the most uptodate but give egl a search    personally what i did was put it under cold running water until the water ran clearish then agitate and soak in cold water and detergent changing the water when it looked too dark after the dress could soak without dye leeching into the water i rinsed it out again then put it through my washer on cold in a delicates bag to get the last of the excess dye out
  youre trying way too hard to be cool anon its really pathetic
    kek
  well thats kind of your fault for flying with lolita thats something you should never do
  nayrt but ive flown in lolita before with 0 issue its really not a big deal same goes for packing lolita for flights and long trips
  who hurt you
  youre trying way too hard to be cool anon  if thar were the case i wouldnt be posting on 4chan silly       tina fey when she threw out norm macdonalds jokes
  anon youre cracking me up youre so triggered by tina fucking fey
  shes garbage my dude
  nayrt but why not its not much different from regular clothing dont see why it would be a problem
  thank you so much anon your technique sounds a lot like what i was planning to do just rinse it until the excess dye comes out i feel a lot more confident about trying it now with some color catcher sheets thrown in there because fuck it i already bought them anyways
    i think the initial shock of seeing it look like that overrode any possible redeeming points about the color but i can kinda see what you mean about it being ok now      it was the ecru color from dylon cotton dye so not tea      jacquard sells a color remover powder that activates with hot/boiling water so that took everything out without needing to resort to bleach
    nayrt ive flown in lolita cutsew ops ftw shirred pieces are still also comfy but when i read  she said she had a wig on besides a moitie headbow and mentions putting her ensemble back on after airport security like how complicated was her ensemble to begin with i think thats the point where i noped out     like i mean yes lolita is just clothes yes some peeple wear wigs on the regular yes headbows are also just clothes but doing the whole shebang with public transport and knowing you need to go through airport security i mean i do cutsew ops because i can wear a wireless sports bra underneath and i avoid dresses that look like the buttons might be metal and here this girl is doing the full wig and whatever else is going on with her ensemble     i dont know i think a younger me would have done it but seriously gals dont do this its stressful enough to fly especially if you need to rely on public transport being on time pick simple clothes so you dont have to worry about dropping bits of accessories in faraway airports that you may never be able to get back to lolita or not
  i also used pretty generous amounts of detergent hoping that the sulfates would loosen up the color that bled onto the print and as more insurance against the dye setting unfortunately since it was an all over print with quite a bit of white space i couldnt really clean individual sections     good luck anon let us know how it goes im rooting for you
  im one of the anons who commented before about flying in lolita and i agree with this its definitely possible to wear lolita for flights and be comfortable but you need to be smart about it having said that i do feel bad for the op she was clearly young and silly when she did that
ive had a few so prepare to be spooked    spilled onions sauce on my first dream dress the first time i wore it didnt notice until a few hours after wed left the restaurant thankfully it rinsed out after a lot of gentle hand washes but i was mortified and really upset at the time it was maybe my second or third brand dress ever    someone once spilled half a glass of cider down the front of my wonder cookie op i nearly died thankfully that print is really sturdy and it came out of the washing machine like new no colour run or anything     this ones the real horror story i threw a load of hardier brand pieces an old op some socks a blouse in a wash with a towel im less careful with a lot of stuff that i know isnt really delicate somehow there was a dress wrapped up in the towel some jordash/dark star green crush velvet thing i was holding onto for halloween   it ran into everything   i was so confused when i opened the washing machine because as far as i knew i hadnt put anything else in but when i saw the culprit i got so pissed off that i immediately threw it in the bin i was so furious   the lace on the op was a greenwhite the blouse was pinkgreen the socks were now greygreen and black i washed them and washed them but nothing would work the dye that ran in just wouldnt come out of anything at all     happy ending a friend took care of the op and its like new again and the blouse too the socks are still grim but im holding onto them in the hope that i might find a way to save them they were the striped bxw otks from the holy cross release and they dont seem to pop up often
  may i ask which larp anon
  its not really a horror story if you do it deliberately is it
  japan fucking loves pleather for some reason fuck pleather how is it 2018 and we still dont have a suitable vegan substitute for leather so that people wont get uppity about animal based goods seriously pleather is so bad i wonder how the fuck it even took off as something stable to use for fucking bags it cracks within a few uses and flakes off like crazy    fuck pleather also fuck genuine leather too fucking stupid ass marketing term used to trick people shit should be illegal to use hehe its technically genuine leather so we arent lying yeah but its fucking glued together floor scaps of leather thats just a step above pleather but will still crack apart because its crap    tfw i just use kate spade with my brand and ap doesnt get my money because they want to make a bag thats like 2 work of materials cost 80    make fucking leather versions of your bag ill pay 500 for it fuck you
  do you know what your friend did to save them sounds like something id wanna write down
  once saw a 35 year old eating a bag of fucking cheetoes   shirt is a fuckin mess fingers not only have cheetoes on them but also what looks to be what i hope is chocolate  nose dripping with snot  im in mint honey cake  he hops out of his carriage and walk towards the street while his mom was smoking a cigarette 5 feet away looking in the opposite direction  simply say hey your kid  she doesnt even turn realize she has headphones on  im not gettin close to that shit and risking my dress getting ruined  car swerves and honks  mom realizes what happens   runs to kid  looks around to see me  why the fuck didnt you try to save him he could have been killed    bitch not my responsibility fuck off nobody told you to get knocked up and then smoke a cig on the side of the road without watching him glad im a lesbian and dont have to ever deal with that shit
  people who cant tell the difference between chocolate and shit are astounding
  god i would have done the same  natural selection
  oh my bad i guess i dont see enough shit smeared fingers in my life to know the difference between it and chocolate maybe i should hang around preschools more
  says the person who was going to let a child die just because you didnt like their parent    we dont need another sandy hook anon
  why cant strangers watch my kid for me  please never breed
  wtf anon its not their responsibility to be looking after some stupid broads brat if that child got hurt that would be on the incompetent parent
  aint anons fault if the kid is too dumb to live and its mom doesnt care  like the other anon said natural selection
  just stand there and watch a kid get run over  lol not my fault  this is so fucking try hard edgy
  a bystander doesnt have to risk their life to save someone sorry that is such a difficult concept for you to understand
  i hope you get hit by a car you bitch
  nobody is obligated to risk their life for a random person not doing so doesnt make someone a bad person not too mention at the very least shed have ruined an expensive item if she tried to intervene
  not too mention at the very least shed have ruined an expensive item if she tried to intervene  could have easily pushed the kid out of the way and then scolded the mother for not paying attention to her kid by explaining that her kid almost fucking died    see   good samaritan law exists so that people just stand around like insensitive tools watching someone fucking die because oh no not my expensive clothing thats shallow as fuck
  but the kid ended up being fine i bet if she pushed the kid out of the way and he fell the mom would freak out at her given how negligent of a mother she already was
  how is risking your dress risking your life  how shallow are you to think your dress is worth more than a childs life  i get that the mother was being irresponsible but that doesnt excuse her being a crappy person who values a dress over life
  its my responsibility to protect someone elses life    not even police do this  
  implying kate spade is much better  we have a poorfag in the house
  good samaritan law does not compel anyone to action good samaritan law is not meant to force you to do something you are not willing to do    good samaritan law does protect you should something go wrong while you are helping  say the kid does get hurt by being pulled back he falls and scrapes his knee good samaritan law protects you from being sued by his mother for causing him to scrape his knee
  there are people who have been pulled into court and put under oath to give testimony because they chose to be a witness instead of doing anything as the other option was to pay a hefty fine because they sat there and watched someone die    letting someone die in front of you is different from saving someones life im not talking about running into a burning building im talking about not letting someone get hit by a car      my god i would not use us police force as an example of good people are you retarded
  yea if she didnt communicate maybe i would alert the mother as i was grabbing the kid away from the car i guess morons dont know how to function in society which explains why you wouldnt know how to handle the situation all you know how to do is keep your clothes clean
    youre still going on about this you know after those 3edgy5me deleted comments you made about muslims you have absolutely zero claim to any moral high ground youre just as much as an edgy cunt as that other anon just let it die
  no i was not the person who posted gore i just agreed with them because that is exactly the kind of mentality im talking about and im not the only person arguing that a childs life is more important that your sjw bullshit go cry not all muslims on tumblr and fb where it belongs    a child shouldnt get run over because honey cake is more important thats fucking dumb anon
    you do know youre being baited to argue right
  anon dont pull this haha you think thats expensive shit doesnt do anything useful for the thread cut it out     what bags would you suggest instead
  you type like that goose lady and i live for it
  i handwashed it in the sink with a bunch of oxiaction stain remover i think i might have also put it through the washing machine on the delicate cycle once just make sure you straighten out all the bows and stuff once it comes out and dry it flat
  but it is better it doesnt peel or flake    are there any highend western brands that offer anything remotely loliable anyways kate spade is hit or miss but they have some stuff that works
    i finally had a chance to try and rescue my dress today and im pleased to announce i was successful i ended up hand washing it with some gentle detergent and color catcher sheets twice then rinsed it 4 times until the water was completely clear if you look really close you can see where the color ran before but its 90 gone and since its a busy print i doubt anyone will ever know thank you anon for your help in saving my baby
  awesome im so happy to hear that anon hopefully the last bit comes out eventually but im so glad youve rescued it
  yes i know anon i dont even think that story is real honey cake anon posted a typical tough guy greentext story it read like something youd see on /v/ or /ck/
  virtue signalling on /cgl/  while simultaneously making fun of sandy hook   fuck off
  fucking this you smug cunt   if brand is more important than a life to you you need to seriously get some help like professionally because youre a shitty person i bet people hate you irl and talk massive shit behind your back    not even a single anon that has posted so far
  is this the shitty meme guy i love the bad ps
  making fun of  not what happened i mentioned it    not sure what virtue signaling is but it sounds like a fucking buzzword sorry but honey cake will never be more important than a childs life this is pure commonsense and i say this as someone who doesnt want to have kids but that doesnt mean id let one die
no as drastic as others but one time my blouse got stuck really badly in the zipper of one of my brand dresses that i never even got to wear out previously before that yet i tried to ease it out but it became clear that id either have to wear a half zipped up dress for the rest of my life or break the zipper
  i know this is from two weeks ago but for anyone else in same situation try vinyl collectible toy cleaners like the ones sold by twin pines or volks its meant for lifting decades old marker and makeup off old dolls and figures so it works well takes a while for certain stains but at least its safe on vinyl bags and shoes
ugh just put a hole in a pair of aatp socks even after cutting my nails right back and wearing sockettes underneath guess im gonna have to learn how to darn darn
  if you have holes with no explanation maybe check your place for clothes moths its probably more realistic that they were torn without you noticing or something and i dont know if moths even go after the sort of material lace is made out of but just to rule that out i guess
a somewhat bizarre one from years ago i got a new red velvet jsk pic related and wore it with an ivory chiffon blouse    at the end of the day the blouse was stained red from the jsk i knew that colour could run but this literally transferred while i was wearing it i guess the sweat from my skin must have made it run i wasnt even sweating all that much though i managed to get the dye out after several washes with stain remover though the blouse is now pretty much white instead of ivory
going for korean all you can eat while drunk and in lolita was probably not a smart decision   nothing could have made that point more clear than accidentally getting spicy oil from chicken aaaaaallll over myself   my white sleeves were orange and soaked through and the print of my sk looked ruined     oxyclean could only do so much and bleach was out of the question but good ol dish soap and elbow grease did the trick   3 hours of my life were wasted scrubbing my mistakes out of my brand but it was worth it
  your mistake was looking like a person that noticed him out of the buggy and not just as oblivious as she was
  small claims court seriously you should have got your money back for the destroyed dress you had witnesses
spilled coffee all over my holy bunny bag and an ap blouse and op last weekend immediately threw it all off when i got home so glad i got it all out but i was on the verge of tears over holy bunny i love that bag
    ive put more holes in tights after clipping my nails than having longer nails  theyre super sharp after youve just clipped them i started filing mine with a nail file and its cut down on holes in tights
  ive had the same thing happen with a surface spell set same material jsk with a chiffon blouse   after a couple of hours the blouse was stained around the underarms im guessing it was sweat that caused it to transfer   i was able to remove the errant colour with sunlight handwashing soap the bar kind i use that laundry bar for all of my stained things it removes the stain 90 of the time the other 10 i take to a drycleaner
dont see one in the catalogue     a thread for asking for help tweaking a coordinate or for when youre not sure whats not working in an idea you had maybe you need some pointers on meshing pieces together this is a thread for when you already have the basic idea of what youre doing for simple questions please see the stupid questions thread old one is full im sure someone will make a new one sometime
so i feel a little silly starting the thread when asking for help with a fandom coord but here goes i dont have a hard time making coords normally but i want this to read well as a coord in its own right aside from being a character homage    obviously doing a bakura themed coord but im uncertain where exactly to take it in parts utilizing my jun ling skirt and tights and ill be getting the boz lp in februaryish which has a nice simple white blouse that ill put the hair clip on as a neck bow for a boz jacket i own the leftmost one and will have the lp one but is it just roland bias making me think it would be best and i should search it out would need size l hence why i dont have one yet but if its certainly better ill make an effort    accessory color is where im torn i own both the meme headdress and new hecate one in black but in white they could imitate bakuras spiky white hair not going to wear a wig obviously that veers into cosplay if i did get them in white i could try tying in more with with the ap elegant doll shoes in white i own and buy or commission a corsage in blue/white to go on the jacket bag can also help tie in more blue or white in as needed or should i just stick to black everything i feel like white legwear would look off    id really appreciate help/feedback on this idea its been floating in my head ever since this egyptian print came out and its just something fun to work on too
  i love yugioh so i support this ive definitely considered getting a white jacket like the ones you have pictured to do some kind of kaiba coord lol    for your questions i think the jacket you own is suitable enough but try laying it out with the skirt to make sure it doesnt cut off at an odd place my preference for the headdress is the white antique beast bat onekeeping the legwear and shoes black seems best as well i would lay this all out to decide on the bag color    i would personally keep black and blue as the main colors and use white and gold as more minimal accents since i think adding too much of them could look a bit tacky
  ah that sounds so fun especially if youre brunette aatp makes loads of sleeveless white long vests maybe one will pop up pretty cheap someday just for you i look forward to seeing it if it ever happens    but thanks so much for the feedback yeah i dont intend on adding more blue or white than the current plans though you think i should stick with the black shoes with the white headdress at least i own both shoes so ill be able to see what works best down the line thanks again glad to know my idea isnt the worst lol
  nayrt but i think the white shoes would look harsh the balance will be better with just the blouse and headdress for small accents
what would you recommend for a coord with this
  this is a really cool idea and i hope i get to see pictures of you wearing it sometime in the future  while the roland would look good i dont think its going to make enough of a difference to make going through the trouble of getting one worth it when you already have two jackets that would work perfectly well i do agree that you should try it with both to see which one looks more flattering though  i also prefer the idea of either headdress in white but i really do think it would look better with white legwear instead of black
  the colours are a bit hard to pick out in your photo but i would match your coord with the little accents on the dress so cream/white/offwhite tights to match the collar black heeled brogues/oxfords or mary janes a fairly simple black headbow and classic satchel style bag     if you wanted to wear something over it id go for a cardigan that picks out the red colour or black or if youre in a cold place a capelet over the top     classic low key makeup and hair with simple dainty jewelry     can i ask which dress this is anon its adorable
  my teen years were spent obsessing over marik x bakura    i approve of this coord
so i asked in the worn thread to almost no avail about how i could coord this dress so im assuming this might be the better thread to ask in i was thinking about finding one of those long sleeve turtleneck iw cutsews to wear with it but im still not even sure there my friend recommended a faux fur capelette but as i dont own one yet and its just a cape it still doesnt help me out much i own a few white poodle purses and i have a pair of btssb heart buckle shoes in sax id like to pair with it but that still leaves me without legwear or a blouse im pretty open to different interpretations because honestly im stumped on how to coord it but i am more of a fan of cotton fabric/lace and round collared blouses if that helps at all
  thank you   im a bit new to lolita but if im right its victorian rock from milk  this is the listing i got it from if its any help 
  here is an example of how to work in an accent color to add interest to your coord   i thought would be good inspo since its the same the and main color
    oops
  this is pretty much just how i would wear it if i had it in the most boring way but here you go id go with sax accents over fully sax accessories and keep the focus on the jsk i dont know how this would look without winter accessories though the heavy fur trim on the bottom makes it harder to style for me it would also look cute in an overaccessorized lateold school coord imo  ps imagine that the whites match couldnt find anything better through lolibrary
  i do like the idea of having red accents i like sax and cherry red a lot for a more vintagey50s vibes this probably could make a cute 50s style winter coord if i can find the right pieces      anon this dress actually comes with matching earmuffs i dont have a picture and it seems like no one online actually has a picture of them but theyre like heart shaped and faux fur maxipad headdress style its pretty cute i love the idea of this even if it is basic i need to start somewhere with it thank you
  i think you could use this for a simple cozy look  id bring out the red with a red beret and socks and then go with black shoes and bag   if you include outerwear as suggested then use the red for that and pair white legwear instead    i think it would be cute to take some otome inspiration and use a pair of patterned legwear in similar colors such as an argyle if this seems a bit much for you then dont be afraid to keep it simple
the cosplay conventions i have been to one thing that they have in common is that guy in a deadpool cosplay being/acting obnoxious i wanted to know if its a phenomenon there is presented in other countries than denmark
fellow dk here   i know your pain theyre everywhere anytime i try to have a good time with some friends an obnoxious deadpool comes and ruins everything and makes it awkward for everyone before he runs away off to annoy someone else
dutch anon here     same here
spanish anon here i thought obnoxious deadpool cosplayers were only a thing in my country people in general are pretty rude here but it seems its a worldwide phenomenon
america  yes    obnoxious spiderman seems to also be becoming more prevalent though
the dragoncon parade usually has an entire section of obnoxious deadpool cosplayers     in the usa people like to not just dress up like deadpool and act like assholes but many of them like to do mashups with other characters so you see totally random rawr xd stuff like harley quinn deadpool or jedi deadpool i have no idea if people in other countries feel they have to do that but its a thing here     i try to ignore them but a lot of them want to harass people because they thought it was funny when they saw someone else do it on youtube
  to be fair that one guy on youtube is pretty nice and asks permission for his shots    everyone else is a fucking obnoxious prick
  mexico here we have annoying deadpools and spidermans
and here i though this cancer was mostly in the us theres one at every con
brazil  a lot of them here too
midwest usa yep been an annoying occurrence at every con ive attended since 2010
  dpiddy yeah hes like the only genuinely cool dp cosplayer ive ever seen
russia confirm deadpool retards here as well every con year by year nothing changes every time you see some deadpool guy you can say it totally jerk who think it is fun to annoy everybody girls here think it is fun as well though and always love some jerks so i doubt if its just me such grumpy person who does not get the mood of conventions maybe i just too old for this shit
australian anon  can confirm obnoxious deadpools exist down under
same here in the netherlands
    we have a dutch deadpool who released a book written from the perspective of dpthis is the first page and handed this out at prizes at a local cosplay contest
also always an annoying star lord that wants to dance    like so 2007
texas the deadpools seem to be getting less obnoxious over the years i remember they used to be super annoying or im building up a tolerance
    they are here in canada too they seem to think their in character bs is somehow cute or acceptable     fuck that shit
never see any splatoon cosplay around these parts i know a lot of them are bad but surely there are some good ones right post em here and feel free to post tips/tricks/whatever about making good splatoon cosplays too
    i seriously doubt this is a coincidence the first sentence being similar to never see/talk the second sentence being a question the third sentence asking people to post in your thread    yes i was there for your thread in /sci/        you caught me off guard last time but this time i was ready and i ended up being successful    this was a fun challenge
  perhaps threads always take longer to upload than posts anyway  that being said i do want to see splatoon cosplay in this thread looking through the archives its been mentioned few times on /cgl/ and finding good stuff is hard most of the splatoon cosplay ive seen is offputting or forgets essential parts like the eyemask i figured /cgl/ would know better cosplays and how to make better splatoon cosplays
what the fuck is going on in this thread
tentacles never look good in these cosplays i have no idea how to make them work even if they look skillfully made they just look bad
    how would anons suggest making marinas wig it seems impossible to make it look good
  its pretty much impossible
  smaller suction cups than that girls maybe smoothed out a bit more her long one looks a bit rough at the bottom  maybe if someone built a base out of balloons and then liquid latexd it and filled that with stuffing it could work
    does anyone know who that girl is and if she has a cosplay tutorial page im willing to spend so much time on getting good marina tentacles   i tried to make ones with ovc and stuffing and it super did not work
  marina   pearl   callie   marie 
    heres a good reference shot for marina so you have a good idea of how it should look like
im goiing to be doing the headpiece and tentacles out of casted flexible resin with sparkle flakes in it as one whole piece is there any reason why this wouldnt work    girlfriend is doing something similar but different with some pvc sheet and a filling but im uncertain if itll go as well
  which character are you cosplaying as anon
  pearl
  wig covers the 5head  whats the fucking point
  i want to do a generic squid and my girlfriend is opting for either a squid or octoling short haired versions because otherwise itd be a nightmare
  not looking unkawaii is better than not looking accurate duh
  implying 5heads are unkawaii and not a sign of superior cuteness    fucking normies i s2g
  if youre doing short haired tentacles you could probably afford to use slightly heavier materials if itll help the look of the tentacle hair
  marina is so good
  yup thats what we plan pure resin for the entire headpiece is surely going to be heavy
  what the fuck for a split second i believed what i read
veemo
really good head hoping to see it finished some day
  whos the artist 
    rinrintwindrill on twitter
  mythical /sci/cgl/ crossboarders
  thats pretty damn accurate though the ears shouldnt curve upwards like that
  big tiddy pearl  so wrong yet so right
for only 18 forever21 will help you become a real anime with this eyeshadow palette book are you hype anon
i like how the whole cover is pink but theres only one real pinkku in the whole thing and four almost identical shades of offwhite
  what a shite looking anime themed palette might as well buy a better quality neutral palette from morphe or some quad from the drugstore with that many similar colors
why put a magical girl on the cover then make the entire palette nude/neutral
  is this real    the nasake on the right middle  o i am laffin
  its real there are even youtube reviews
    manga eyeshadow palette  samey instathot makeup instead of something themed to a more cutesy theme like the girl on the palette cover    i mean i guess she didnt have that much choice but would it kill her to do something different than fuckin laser cut eyebrows and smokey eyeshadow
  lmao can we do away with overlined lips already those only look good on drag queens    but im not surprised ive gone to riley rose several times in my area and only one of the employees doesnt do instahoe makeup this had a lot of potential maybe should hand the concept over to sugarpill theyre more familiar with notbasic makeup looks
rude japanese anime
  wheres the pink
    all i could hear in my head was hey wanna look like one of your precious animu want some funny crazy palettes to express yourself with look at this cover doesnt it look promising boom bitch enjoy your 16 shades of motherfucking brown
absolute trash when people bitch about people buying makeup for packaging this is exactly what they mean also pretty sure all makeup from f21 is shit anyways
im absolutely no artist but is it me or does the girl on the cover have really odd proportions if we look at the legs and compare it to the angle of the torso
i am in love with that outside but wtf at the colors ill just buy a sugarpill palette and print an anime character for the front
there is only one shade in that whole palette that even looks like pink on my screen i can only imagine this being used for middle school aged weebs wanting to show how anime they are
rude cosmetics is a cheap makeup brand intended for small companies to buy from wholesale this was just one of many book themed palettes others were unicorn themed scifi themed but all had pretty neutral colors since the intended audience is for normies not weebs and lolitas f21 did not make this palette
  her use of the bikini bottom font fuck
        keeks depotted it and replaced the pans with mac eyeshadows i like her version so much more than the original
  attacking girls choice of makeup on this board and complaining when theyve never talked to you  yikes
  girls never criticize other girls  are you new here
old thread       /cgl/ idol spreadsheet      /cgl/ resources spreadsheet under hiatus      previously  footage from starlight idol festival rolls out  sakura hana  can she be saved  akiba idol emily posts some ambiguous stuff and apparently quits the idol scene  kazu from tambourine idols is caught talking shit on her spam account    since most of us here are active in the scene lets talk about what youre looking forward to creating or sharing any release plans for halloween/fall/coming months     featured group pastel girls
also not sure if it was brought up last thread but the overseas idol collection website just launched their resource database so theres a list of composers mixers artists etc that are open for commission     heres something to start off the thread   stellure had mentioned finding mixers to be the biggest obstruction to them posting clean audio and not just doing live performances so hopefully this means they can put out lyric videos for their other songs soon too i really liked sincerely yours and im looking forward to its video
    any release plans for halloween/fall/coming months   im hoping to finally start my solo odottemita youtube channel this month currently learning a couple covers to film including a halloween one to have some content for a few weeks while i work on a larger project for the channel im really excited for it
    this is super cute i didnt expect anyone to make a dance cover with n girls
  that was a lot better than i expected i didnt really like how sexual some of the scenes looked like why were they being pushed down onto the table   editing and expressions/attitude was great
  wow thats some fantastic mv style editing the expressions were so good and the way they handled props was exceptional
    dia deserves better
  i wish theyd used some of the official outfits but these make more sense with the theme and filming i guess reminds me of the time i saw a seira cosplayer with a perfect replica of the cherry dress she was so cute
oof sorry for double comment i came here to share this video actually and got distracted    
  hamako is a steaming pile of garbage
im not sure if it has been talked about here but im interested in your gulls thoughts about the top kofi reward tier    background its a local idol dance cover group who are raising money for cosplay travel and accom to a different state for a convention    1 kofi usd3  250 kofi  usd750    it sits really wrongly to ultimately be pimping out a member if someone is putting that amount in it would be to specifically get in the draw and they have written any limitations or even locations it might be a joke tier but it seems way too risky
  havent written any limitations
  first kofi tiers seem so weird in the first place i dont know much about it but is it like patreon where its monthly    second i dont know if thats her idea or not but even putting it there as a joke seems really out there it says draw which implies multiple people which just sits wrongly and then the boundaries thing
  kofi isnt a monthly thing just a one off payment   i think their total goal is just under usd1600 which is around aud220
when will ppl learn that some ll songs are boring to watch on stage 
ive started thinking of trying to create a dance comm in boston since it doesnt seem like there is one aside from the billion ll cover groups ive just been wanting to jump around to some cute and old vocaloid songs i hope people would want to join ive never really been active in my local comm so im not sure what to expect
  it sucks because this is a great song and their dancing isnt bad but holy shit that is a huge stage its all about how you use space but thats way too big case in point    
  i was thinking of starting my own channel too i havent been able to learn any dances cuz of school so maybe ill just refilm an old one i learned if i do something for halloween    anyone here going to the anisong world matsuri in new yorn next month
  i dont like this at all it is essentially pimping out a member what if the people putting money towards this draw are total creeps i dont know a levelheaded person who would put in 750 for a date with an idol group member
  coming from someone who has done something similar in my own town dont expect much and just go for it
  if you could do it again what would you do differently is there anything you wish youd have known
  id be more strict with who i accepted into the group at first i accepted everyone who wanted to do it rather than actually tested if they were motivated enough to actually help put out good content because of that i ended up with a lot of drop outs and people who didnt like to practice over time people were weeded out but i couldve avoided all of that
    fan/idol dates are pretty heavily monitored and planned out in advance by the girls and the production invovled they have places picked out and the staff is on standby anyone who does this is most likely going to be a local fan and they would be banned from the local shows if he decides to be a major creep with her    and given the experience most of these girls have with different types of fans they can deflect the average creep trying to go too fast they will make you feel like you are the center of attention but only the ones who really connect with the date actually have a chance of making this actually feel like a real date instead of emulating one
  ok but this is literally a cosplay group offering one of their members to be dated not an idol group
  i mean if they are of age and consented whats the issue
    i think they took that idea from a couple of idol groups i have heard of this once        note the accompanied by a staff member part so haphazardly making a guess i think someone in aquaria will do the same to make sure nothing gets out of hand    but given they are just an amateur group
  uh 1600 usd is 223885 aud anon
  in the draw   i feel like its going to be actually be juried rather than lottery honestly despite what they may officially say
  but will more than one person actually give that much money anyways 
  they can always claim so i mean who is even going to check like just have another group members brother go on the date and go teehee what a coincidence
sorry if this is somewhat off topic but would it be weird to try to become an idol in my mid 20s i had a small following in my late teens but life happened and i kind of fell off of the face of earth but after a trip to japan and several people telling me i have what it takes i kind of want to archieve my dream again  would it be weird  i am assuming most western idols are young teens just like in japan
  a lot of western idols are in their mid 20s if not older honestly you should just go for it might as well have fun
  do it seriously like the anon above me said there are a lot of 20something idols out there
  do you know what the climate is for idols in japan right now have you done your research into visas and how work conditions will be i would not advise going japan to be an idol right now
im trying to find a decent miracle wave dance cover thats not sunrise or aquarius but i stumbled upon this    
    this is the one with the flip right  thats a lot of shit in the room how is she gonna do that    its just if youre going to learn a dance wouldnt you rather learn one you can actually participate in apart from weebleing on the spot idly because youre waiting on other parts to finish or at the very least learn the part which is centre at that time
ellie of lnav quit the group two members down after mocha left arent they supposed to be performing in december
  i mean you can cover the song perfectly fine without being chika but this girl avoided nearly every part where you go onto the floor or do a spin the dance can still be fun/interesting without attempting the flip but she didnt even try
  uhhh how old is their mari this absolutely feels like they are pimping out one of their members if shes under 17 then /yikes/ they need to be told they cant do that and if shes over 18 and the only one in said group thats over 18 at that thatsabsolutely pimping out your member just because shes legal    who is monitoring this date the other members most dance groups dont have dedicated staff that arent just their other friends in their age group or even just themselves most the time its incredibly risky for them to do that as even just a joke
  i think they should just focus on mystic wish they can always do ll songs if they feel like it and its much more entertaining than just being another ll group not to mention it doesnt keep them stuck at always having 9 members     i think they were a good group but they dont keep enough of a presence online or actively post enough to get anywhere maybe if they just focus everything into this new group they can actually make something of it
      that is utterly low effort    and on the other end of the spectrum you got the overachievers more asian ll groups being good at what they do only a couple of problems there        a disregard of personal safety when it comes to the chika cartwheel during the live tour they set gym mats for anju so she doesnt hurt herself if anyone here decides to do miracle wave remember safety first on the stage     punk rock is a vocal style outfit not a high energy dance outfit i though their chika was desperately trying to check if her strap fell off     the chika cartwheel was only 2/3 if she dont think she can do all three at once pause the music till she execute the third cartwheel
      is this a joke is that actually considered good new to the scene and genuinely curious
  if you can speak full fluid japanese get a visa to japan work your butt off for a long time to afford travel and get a place to stay actively audition over and over up against actual japanese girls sure    but my question is it really a dream once you make an audition are you aware/ok with the fact that this whole shebang lasts maybe a year or two max you work overtime constantly making a part time pay lots of idols have a second job or get into sex work to afford their idol career if they even have time you will probably also not be a front girl is all of the time prep cost and all a dream
    welcome to the odottemita thread where only the most morbidly untalented dances by weebs are viciously mocked to oblivion
    the people saying you have what it takes were scammers    im not being negative im saying that as a fact the prime agencies who will treat you like an actual human being pay you properly give you housing and work with your visa arent the ones telling just any one you have what it takes they are the ones going throw tens of thousands applicants every audition the open and picking like 3 girlstheres a reason why the same net idols get posted on here we like their dances and they make good side money off of it the best thing that comes out of it for most is the be dance choregrapher/ background dancer in a video for the real star    like  said if your cant speak/read fluent japanese which im going to guess is correct because of most of the board always asking for translations then seriously its hopeless    become a net idol get a following is your best bet but actual idols on stage with a high end agency isnt happening the only foreigners they ever take are from other east asian countries or halfus
  exactly there is no risk in being a net idol or performing at cons
    nice use of the frilled dress during baam
  what is so awful about it     i think they said on instagram they already had a replacement
naomi and juju both left one wish       
  i wonder what kind of internal drama lnav has to have such a high turnover for members
  i doubt its drama i think its just the commitment since they practice a lot and a lot of them are at the age where they have to focus on school
its drama check mochas youtube for her post about leaving also she just posted on her story about feeling outcast from the group which is sad i think the og members are running the group and not letting the new ones have any say in anything
  mocha is overdramatic about everything always i dont put much stock in her reaction at all
  jenny has left now as well
why is seishun youth academy never mentioned itt
  theyve been mentioned plenty but fact of the matter is that all they do is perform live and do the same songs as when they debuted no single no mv no new songs afaik no reason to talk
has anyone seen this              
  when she nudges at the blanket with her foot  my sides
    the spanish one looked really good they got the looks     and elis birthday gives me the perfect excuse to post cosplay dance covers featuring eli        
  they never do anything cringy enough lol
    new content from stellure i cant believe they were like yup that sounds great about the beginning of the song
    everything is just starting to sound the same to me i dont know if its the flat vocals or what but i probably couldnt differentiate between their songs if my life depended on it
  they do know the entire group doesnt dance at the same time in relay right
  i dont know i think this video is pretty cute at least song quality aside i know its just a kpop dance meme thing but its nice to see the girls having fun/not looking awkward/wearing clothes that actually fit and flatter them than whatever monstrosities mimi makes for them im still sort of rooting for them because theyre always just a little bit short of good if they took classes on stuff like singing and dancing then i think it would actually be pretty enjoyable to watch them this stupid video is somehow miles better than whatever that panel nonsense was that got posted here a few threads ago
    not sure if anyone has talked about this yet but this girl calls herself a jpop singer and dancer
  i feel the same way i dont get how they get so much positive feedback about their singing when it sounds that flat
  she looks really stiff with her dancing
  i will say at least that in the local comm they are very active and put on great shows they draw pretty big crowds and are already going to be holding their second solo live in the next couple of months which i dont think many groups have done at this point as in renting a space themselves selling tickets to the event organizing everything themselves without like the help of a convention or something but i do agree its hard to follow them or interact with them unless you live close to where their performances are held
the animeusa idol showcase was this weekend  did anyone go
  i left midway because there were to many love live groups
    wait there were non lovelive groups at animeusa
  danzoo dash fsk and dtp were there i think the rest was all love live
  genki girls and juliane were present too they had mini lives outside the dealers hall i really think its sad ausa didnt let them in the idol showcase considering it was oversaturated with love live there was barely an audience towards the end because of it
  lol at least one of the girls in genki girls and julily performed in the showcase with different groups
  not to mention the sound guy was absolutely horrible the event was about 40 minutes over time and it was supposed to last from 1 pm to 4 pm i felt bad for the acts on stage when they had to deal with all the technical difficulties the sound tech took waaaayy too long to play songs people lost interest too because you got mediocre acts performing up there they just left the room what i find ridiculous is that on their application form there was no section for groups to link videos of themselves meaning the one in charge wouldnt be able to tell if a group was good or not ausa idol showcase was a mess
       wow our scene is just slowly phasing out the ll groups except for newers ones    and for another topic which songs and outfits are what you call the budoir of odottemita aka using sex sells to gain viewers and male fans
  garasu no hanazono anything that uses yuri pandering
  holy crap thats a long showcase  sounds like they should have been pickier with who could perform and cut the time down who wants to spend that long at a convention watching shitty ll covers
  i cant tell if its just her shirt that is loose or if shes not wearing a good bra but the amount of bounce just looked painful   idk how long she has been dancing but if shes just starting out she has a solid foundation to build on
    wait there are good ll covers aside from chinese ll competitions which have enough groups competing now
  speaking of which anyone here going to holiday matsuri this year i couldnt go last year but im considering going this year and going to their idol fest and idol related panels
  shes not great but shes not horrible either plus shes cute at least
  because i wanted to be fair i sat through all of it all 3 hours and 45 min well that time is gone and while danzo is good and imho they performed better here than at their awa and their awa show was really good the in house maids did a pretty good job and they sung dtp was pretty good and fsk is well they are utterly competent i mean that in a good way they have really good dancing and seem like one of those stereotypical urban multicultural youth dance teams  that is in an advertisement for soda or nikes     there was a lot of love live like i could honestly go a month without love live and the best ones were 9pbm was good the puka puka had really good stage presence and the 2 girls had like solid starter group but otherwise it was the same stuff i have seen from small and amature groups across the country      god yes like please someone make an idolmster or kpop or something i am begging you
    the problem is idolmaster suffer from the following problems      1 copyright issues and crap the japanese are particularly anal about copyright and its difficult to find promotional videos of jpop online compared to kpop less accessibility matters especially when there is competition    2 image issues akb48 vs your standard kpop group like blackpink and twice although you can apply that to idolmaster vs love live    3 same old japanese insularity the japanese music industry is uninterested in expanding their foreign presence local sales matter more so the asia pacific region is ignored to the delight of the koreans or in our case love live which is the only idol series to have any overseas presence    it isnt totally bleak if you have a good solid community who can give access to resources about idol groups beyond ll and vocaloid but communities like atlanta and seattle dont have access to younger asian communities who knows a lot about idols and merchandise that isnt bootlegged goods so we are seeing a larger ratio of ll cover groups vs non ll cover groups because it is the only thing they really know jidols is not a plug and play genre but requires dedication
  while you are primarily right about these things i think a bit of information needs to be updated     the japanese are particularly anal about copyright and its difficult to find promotional videos of jpop online compared to kpop   while in recent years there have been issues with jpop and copyright not only have they not always existed but theyve also been significantly improved over the past 12 years not only that but kpop at a time had the exact same issue but it still thrived on even during its dark period both love live and ims are under lantis looking at their channel or doing a quick search of lantis idolmster brings up promo videos     the japanese music industry is uninterested in expanding their foreign presence  while this is still very much true for a majority of artists including underground ones in recent years a lot more groups and franchises have been trying even if minimally to gain more overseas traction not because of ll or anything like that but because of the fact theyre realizing that a lot of people are actually paying for their content which also had a lot to do with the restrictions being less strict with that said though there have been more effort put into overseas fans for hp  48g than there has really been for ll    or in our case love live which is the only idol series to have any overseas presence  being the most popular does not mean the only love live has the largest overseas presence  i think its because people lactched onto the concept of look we do it ourselves not with an agency but we also see many people interested in bandori now too which more or less started right out marketing to overseas from day one theyre also pretty much a diy series which i think is the issue with ims its not relatable enough    tldr  japan has issues but lets not pretend like its the only reason people arent interested people like easy access because theyre lazy
  unless youre trying to be a kawaii loli idol desu i think you will be fine there are some good idols in their 20s but thr best advice i can give when being an older idol is to act your age or else you will be cringy
  actually only part of ims is under lantis iirc million live and sidem while the rest is under columbia who is much more strict the non ml 765 songs and cinderella girls some songs like dream arent on youtube at all because of copyright issues
  youre right they are under different agencies but still searching columbia music jp idolmster still shows quite a few results if they arent on youtube its probably more of a licensing issue than it is copyright still there are videos from the games that are for dream the first i saw was for english subs for the song and scrolling i saw more from years ago so like i said people are just lazy and dont want to actually search
its not hard at all to get into idolmster lol people are literally so lazy     the ml and cg mobile games are so easy to play even if you dont speak jp and theres ton of resources for them the animes ogmas cg and sidem are all on crunchyroll     and if you want music or dances  literally just a google search ive never not been able to find a song or dance from imas that i was looking for     you can easily find bulk downloads of music and there are plenty of fans im really confused what you people are talking about
  thank you  i am     and it isnt like when i got into imas 8 years ago cg and 765 have anime there is a tumblr with translations of all the content and all the songs you can download torrents are easy to find and twitter people translate all the event stories it is the golden age of being an imas fan you can even find the dances for most of cg on youtube there are a bunch of japanese youtubers who archive them and have them on in 4k at 60fps honestly even the basic bitch cg cosplay starry stary bright which can do literally every girl is cheap enough not ll literally any convention that isnt fucking tiny has sellers easy but can be found on fucking ebay/tabao sic easy
what happened to dejavudea she hasnt posted on twitter since september   people mentioning holiday matsuri reminded me that shes been on radio silence for a while now
  i dont know i really hope it isnt a health issue she even deleted her instagram suddenly and kinda completely stopped her otakon vlog ive been getting nostalgic and watching some of her older vlogs been subscribed since 2014    shes never missed a year of drunk pumpkin carving i secretly hope she returns for that    saged for somewhat off topic
  how are you able to download the games
  ntayrt but either apk or if you have an apple product make a japanese itunes account i personally have quite a few japanese rhythm games
  jfc why are you so mad that more people are into the more easily accessible franchise
  sorry you feel called out for being lazy about expanding your tastes
    ntayrt its frustrating when youve sat by and watched something as mediocre as love live make a killing from the popularity just because it received more of a backing over here in the west and then have people apply that to the real idol industry    meanwhile youve got something with a longer lifespan better outfits a wider range of characters and choreography that doesnt require you to twist the arm of 9 people to be in the same place as once or push them along to finish everything   ive just always loved how easily it is to customise idolmster dances you can have whichever girls so anyone can join and you can switch positions so if someone has stage fright they dont have to be centre if they dont want to    ive gotten each of the games and theyve only gotten easier to understand over time too ims 2 was a bitch however if you dont understand japanese    im not saying people cant start out with love live or aikatsu or whatever but i dont think it hurts to expand a bit once youve done with it because you could end up really enjoying something else and making new friends    then again this is coming from someone who started with ims before this whole idol thing really took off so i appreciate how easy it is to access things now in comparison to then and how savvy people can be with idol culture
its frustrating for me as an ims fan because i think the truth isnt people would like it more if it was accesible  but the truth is a lot of idol fans are lazy teens with bad freaking taste bad at dancing singing cosplaying totally ignorant of what actual idols are up lls ass thinking its actual the best out there and totally lacking the motivation to learn any better     and unfortunately i think those types of people grossly outnumber the others which is why the community is so over saturated with ll bull crap and theres no end in sight     i dont even dislike ll honestly but imo theres so much better out there like ims and it sucks that if i want to go to an idol fest i have to sit through endless awful ll dances just to enjoy the few good performances outside of it which is why i strongly believe people organizing these events should limit ll groups significantly
    the good news is if you make any friends into ims theyre usually keepers pretty much everyone who was into it when i started out is still there unlike those who are rapidly phasing out ll and moving onto the next hype train     i dont know about you but id rather have friends who stick around and will branch into other things on the side with you instead of practically dropping you along with the fad because its all you had in common
  im glad someone else gets it ims is so flexible youd think there would be some more groups out there im not expecting it to be the majority but damn i went to metrocon this year and saw one ims cosplay the whole time i was there it was new gen from cg and they performed onegai cinderella at the idol fest panel no one else seemed to know the calls for it either      im thinking of doing it myself although im not sure ill enter an actual fest just a side thing in the hallway maybe      original branch wise you can choose 13 15 for some songs for almost any song and which order theyre in some songs even have full solo versions the dancing can also be easier for new comers on some songs theres some fun parts for group dances too theres also so many outfits both idol unique and same per idol with different color considering these groups are unstable as hell member wise having dances that are easy to change number of members and vocals for is a good thing heres some in game dances i like personally            i like love live but i prefer variety im sure after the first few times itll get boring as usually only the most popular songs are performed if i heard something like storm in lover id be happily surprised         ive been into ims since the 2011 anime aired i have to admit im not into it as much but thats more because theyre slowly fading 765 out and theyre my favorite branch i like the music from the other branchs but im not as personally invested in them im not sure what i think about pdp in love live either wug is ending soon so im mostly following non idol music franchises at the moment like bandori i hope a new kind of idol series comes id personally like to see one about underground idols
    i also started out with ims as well i will say love live was what actually got me interested in jidol in the first place though        what they need is more variety of songs to practice with    an idea some groups have is taking the sif outfits and doing related songs that is odottemita related can help expose people to new songs i will use kdcc for example as they did a lot of covers of other songs using ll as a base         or just very recently aqours cosplay was used for kyokiranbu since i havent seen non ll cover using aqours so far     
  opinions
  maybe im just naive but are there really that many people actually wanting to become real idols    i see people talk about it on 4chan negatively but everyone i know in person is just doing the net idol thing i didnt think anyone was actually wanting to be in the japanese idol industry     is it actually prevalent enough to warrant a video i like that  i would hope not
  i mean ive been playing starlight stage since day 1 but you cant just deny the accesibility doesnt matter   sure it takes some more effort to start with it but even then theres a lot less merch translations etc to go with idolmaster that makes it harder to get fully into     id also argue that its the amount of characters to a certain degree everyone in ll gets treated with a lot more equal attention then something like cg
    you had a lot of young girls wanting to go audition in korea to become kidols or to work with the company it isnt too hard to not see that happen korea is always looking for expats people who can speak another language to serve as an foreign promoter     with jidols however it is harder since japan doesnt really promote overseas with love live and to a lesser extent akb48 lets face it their influence had been mostly negative for promoting growth outside of japan introducing people to idols you got people invested in the odottemita scene who wanted to become actual pros and hopefully now an audience to back it up
    been following this disaster of a group called hamako idols for a while and they just posted their first live performance thing that mostly turns me off from this group is the two bearded dudes ruby and dia who have a history of harassing girls at conventions
  lets face it their influence had been mostly negative for promoting growth outside of japan  really how come
  hamako is so creepy and cringey and theyre constantly losing members but just wont die
    i made a couple of points here     image is a major problem for jidol given how the initial impression about jidols is how their music sounds childish and like children songs instead of the trendy sounding kpop most foreign sites for japanese news also have a negative perception towards idols in general     but a major hurdle jidols have is japan isnt willing to actively promote their companies outside of japan unless their members push for it and agree to help fund the passion project themselves
if anyone has netflix theres a really informative documentary there called tokyo idols i suggest it    it really made me think and now i think the culture is just sad    its really hard for me to understand how japanese people think because ive had to struggle all my life to finally just accept and be proud of myself so i could be happy man they must be miserable and that just makes me sad    the girl theyre following its like whats she gonna do after this stint as an idol is over what can she do    i guess a lot of these girls hope to become kyary but the audience members it just makes me sad to think about these poor men who spend all this money     i think were being naive anons
  tokyo idols has been proven multiple times that the director had an agenda against japanese idols there is alot of translating issues and things cut intentionally one man interviewed said they pushed others and himself to say certain things also did you notice how many female fans were in crowds there were zero questions asked to female fans on this issue    i would not following what any of that documentary says because of how inaccurate and interntonally misguided it is even a few foreign idols living in japan have negatively reviewed the documentary and director for pushing her agenda and only making it to fit the western views of how creepy and wacky japan for profit
      and this is what i meant by image issues this right there is why jidols have such a huge hurdle to leap that kidols never went through
  wait what i had no idea i want to like everyone but i need to protect my east coast friends    10022186  i am not trying to be an sjw at all but the entertainment industry worldwide as this harvey weinstein thing that just blew up is full of seedy folks so i find this japan is sooo awful guys like kinda exploitive and racist at worst
  storm in lover is one of the most boring dances to watch its my least favorite for sure
  idol industry in japan is awful and not really comparable to american adult actors same with the kpop industry just because you find out your dream of being an idol could be a shitty idea it doesnt make you racist
  ntayrt but while it isnt comparable to the western industry it can be to the korean the only difference is that while japans industry is widely talked about and criticized koreas is not they both have the same problems and scandals just in different capacities neither are great industries to be in
  they just kicked out a member for literally molesting people so you know
hello im hoping selfposts are okay i just uploaded a dance cover and would love concrit    
    the big problem is japan saw no reason to promote overseas so they didnt pay for damage control unfortunately that is also a turn off for potential fans
  its unfortunate that those creeps are involved in that group but the performance honestly wasnt bad
  which one are you
  looks generally really nice my only complaint is that the framing is a little off the camera could be pointing a tad lower also the background could be more interesting for example if it was filmed when it was dark and you could have put some extra lights on the floor etc
    i recommend doing something with your hair next time it was kind of distracting and getting all over the place
  i agree wouldnt say it was good either but just average def forgettable which is better than full on cringe you cant erase from your mind
  youve definetly got the cut smile down but id say next time either just keep it either on the facial expressions or do lipsync not half in half and only do half the lyrics
  im gonna counter this anon and say that doesnt really matter that much if you focus too hard on facial expressions or lyrics it becomes really cringy and forced looking really quick ive seen seasoned idols only do some lyrics and other times have whatever facial expressions when youre dancing youre dancing if you were singing it itd be another story but when just dancing i wouldnt worry too much about that i think you looked fine    but i would agree with the camera angles and location its kind of boring and desu if i was searching for covers of this song to watch i would have skipped this one you could play with the color a bit more as well its very drab
  boring and desu
    maybe do it in front of a haunted house or during night time with pretty orange lights in the backgrounds at the basic level or do it at a spooky setting      
melancholiaah just put this out i like the vocals and the song but sometimes its hard to hear what shes saying what do you guys think   
  the dancing is a bit sloppy  im the worst to give advices to help but i found it too jumpy and not enough controlled hope you understand what i mean good luck 3
  noob
  i love your energy id suggest trying to control your movements more there are times where big movements are great but other times it ends up being too much
  eh id disagree on half/half not being okay as long as its natural and the dance is busy enough i dont see whats wrong with smiling and lip syncing a few lines here and there to hype yourself up
  those two guys are some of the nicest people i have ever met in my 10 year history of attending conventions james and graham are complete sweethearts and ive never heard a single person say anything negative about them before this unless you have evidence to back up your statement about them being creepy you can shut the fuck up
  someone got posted
          noted i will definitely look for a different location next time and fix the camera issues           thanks for the stylistic tips i love dancing with high energy and smiling but maybe ill be a little more selective and add some very clean movements as well    thank you all for your input im glad for the advice now at the beginning of my channel rather than making a bunch of mistakes later down the line so thank you so much
    sadly i have multiple anecdotes about them not being the most innocent  at one virginia con i had a weird interaction with them where they joked about fujoshis despite me barely knowing them and last katsucon my friend asked them to stop making comment on other ruby cosplayers to which they responded why should i so while i have no evidence to document these encounters i have no interest in having any more interactions with them
  just their general presentation makes me think theyre weird not putting on makeup and not even shaving their beard seems like theyre doing it for some trap fetish reasons
  what kind of comments
  female tripfag  someone got posted    you retarded
srproductions posted their auditions but there isnt a timeline which makes me nervous     who all is auditioning im considering
  im sending my files in soon but they said theyre accepting people as they come so theres no telling
  just about every girl i know thats had to be around them was creeped out by them myself included
  i already sent mine im sure itll be fine i think it all has a lot of potential i dont think theyll drop the ball on it after so much work
did anyone else see cosplay realm release that idol themed issue    i dont know why cosplayers think they qualify to give information about idol culture when all they do is talk about or reference love live
    accessibility issue no one with actual knowledge wanting to come out and talk about it    like i didnt there were better odottemita scene in china before a friend shown me some videos of a performance
  things like oh rubys showing a lot of leg and dia let her out like that not necessarily horrible things but still creepy in regards to other cosplayers cosplaying a 15 year old
  no one with actual knowledge wanting to come out and talk about it  no there are so many people out there wanting to share information about idol culture idol culture panels at conventions wouldnt exist if none wanted to share information    the real problem is people not being open to or researching anything beyond love live and media outlets taking the easy way out to make a quick buck
  yes omg i was coming here just to talk about it you are not an idol if you cosplay love live you are just a cosplayer a dancing cosplayer seeing so many misleading informations being shared about idols makes me sick
  thats embarrassing for you       i feel like people get weird about them solely because theyre older guys with beards i have never heard of anyone saying anything even remotely negative about those two before seeing this thread so comments made here just dont add up i feel like people are picking on them because they dont like it that two dudes are having a blast cosplaying their favorite idol girls and wont put effort into being passing because theyre having a ton of fun as is       yall must be in some kind of niche group because again i have never heard of any of this before right now and it seems more than suspicious that everyone all of the sudden has an issue
  a grown ass man with a beard cosplaying a 15year old girl is okay and not predatory at all to you
  i wish they just had a deadline that way id kind of have an idea for when to expect to be accepted or rejected
  yikes gotta love the well ive never heard of it so it never happened attitude how embarrassing for you
  no people can dress how they want and it doesnt mean by default theyre predatory thats not a hard concept       if you have names and details post them
  yeah feeling the same if they dont get good enough candidates they could always extend it but no date sucks
  so sad to see a woman bending over backwards to defend some creepy ass dudes
    stumbled upon this new dance group thing i only see a couple members that have somewhat talent imo i recognize a couple of members from nihana i think but big old yikes they are all so boring to watch dance and why do all dance groups try to go with a galaxy theme its so overused and so bland why cant groups be original
  whats sad is people lying and saying theyre creepy just because you dont like men cosplaying your waifus anyone in the idol community i run with has nothing but nice things to say about these two
    i tend to find a lot of the sexy odottemita love to use the little devil set     as you mention aside from garasu no hanazono you also have koshitantan as another yuri pandering song
  its either galaxy or a sunrise/set theme so overdone
    meanwhile in asia it is food or flowers
  so sad to see people policing who can and cant cosplay idols as if they have some kind of authority on the issue    sorry you dont have any proof
please someone tell idol academy to stop butchering choreography or at least make good original chorography it made me sick to my stomach how horrible the dance instructor rechoreographed 7 girls war and now beginner
  maybe its just me but youre either looking at this from the wrong perspective or youre nitpicking youre right that the choreography is by no means amazing just for beginner i couldnt find 7gw however neither are the people shes working with she was doing simple steps and they still couldnt even follow along that goes for the advanced class too shes also making choreography for people who can barely hold a fucking note or sing and dance at the same time that plays a lot into it too
  not that anon but wouldnt it just be easier to pick basic beginner friendly songs than completely redo hard ones it makes no sense to rechorograph a difficult song like a beginner for beginnerlevel students when they could have picked aitakatta i dont know but it just seems inefficient and a waste of time     i also still agree that idol academy is a scam taught by people with big egos and zero credibility why take paid lessons from ametures when you can spend money on an actual dance and singing studio lessons it costs just as much as their charging
  she  her boyfriend broke up and shes been dealing with that basically im not sure when shell be returning to public social media
  thats so sad i saw she deleted her insta and was really disappointed i hope shes okay and knows that even if the breakup has been really rough shes still an important person to so many people
  dont forget the totally not otonikizaka clone groups
  i dont completely hate her as another anon said if shes just starting out she can greatly improve      she has that same mix of really stiff and really energetic a lot of beginners do
    people like easy access because theyre lazy  thats literally it nobody is saying its hard to get into im were saying its comparatively harder when you consider how accessible love live is and if youre a lazy weeb who already has love live what motivation could you possibly have to look into more intimidating idolmster especially if nobody around you knows it and youd be alienated from your fellow love livers
any good or cringe halloween covers out now that its over not happy halloween or kyun vampire those i dont wanna see anymore
  all i saw were happy halloween covers there were way too many
  any decent ones at least     im tired of the one version where they start by leaning back its so boring at least do the other one if youre going to do such an overdone dance
guyss im having a bad day pls post some cringe i need it
  fuck my eyes and ears are bleedingand whats with the drag make up
  i agree with what you said i feel like its hard to hear/understand because shes singing in an unintelligible falsetto for the chorus and then the music is really loud however i could see this being a song thats super popular within current mainstream pop music the video is done in a similar style and if some scenes and lyrics were tweaked just a little and her voice too at some points it would more than likely be her smash hit if it were well promoted
  oh and cont im curious as to if pale will get or has a music video the description says that pale is the name of the single but dead decade is the one with a mv it should ideally be revered no if it were an album thatd be different
  barely been anything interesting lately its no fun
  yeah idk why everyone always does that song that and fashion monster which isnt even a halloween song
with the dead decade mv its the bside of the single she is releasing the single sometime soon i think december
can any recommend any cute christmas dances i only know merry pin xmas but id love to do something different
  aikatsu has a cute one      aikatsu also has a terrible rap in their we wish you a merry christmas  
  that first one is so ridiculously easy looking
    shooting star idols did a cover of pumpkins nightmare a halloween song thats not done to death yay  
  santasan  shiroi tokyo  pittari xmas   gem one is so pretty also
  i wonder who you are since this was posted to a private group i hope they find who you are
  i was gonna say the same thing she posts there thinking its a safe community to get feedback posting what she puts there is shady as heck
  i may not like her but this was posted to a closed group she is also just a kid i hope admins ban you
  please just delete it its annoying when she finds these threatens to quit for weeks and fishes for pity
yes anon please delete this even if it was posted somewhere else this isnt the place to post that i reported the post incase you dont want to delete it but please do
      heres some christmas vocaloid songs if youre into that
    whos cover was it
  it wasnt a cover the deleted post was of some kids idol persona selfie and anon laughing over whether or not she was not right in the head      egirls  merry x merry xmas         star night snow        hashire penguin    
  hashire penguin is so freaking adorable
    ah i see thats just mean we all have that cringe weeb stage thanks for filling me in anon
  i know them irl and i was there for that so this anon isnt lying i will speak with them and explain that makes people uncomfortable i had no idea because i am sort of autistic idol fan but yeah now that i think about it being well older it makes sense         claudie i know you irl and we are irl friends so i wont yell at you but this is something that both of us being friends with them have a blind spot saying things that makes girls and lets be honest these are girls making this complaint since i doubt any man is posting here uncomfortable isnt nice so we need to address this here
are kpop dances allowed here because if so is anyone excited to do k/da  
  im not excited to see it overdone
      already happening too much
  shes actually good though so im letting this one slide
  kpop is on the same cringe level as love live
  her facials are still cringe though
  ehh theres some beautiful dance routines out there its mainly the mainstream ones that get annoying pretty fast    
  let me reword it the kpop fandom is on the same cringe level as the love live fandom i believe the same thing about the dances but thats subjective
  whomst
  i agree on the fandom     but i dont find their dances comparable in the least kpop pulls a lot from hip hop and tends to be much more difficult technically like actually needing to be flexible go from squatting or sitting positions to standinging smoothly etc     love live dances are like suuuuper watered down cheer dance only the very basics of jazz line and hip hop even a really out of shape person with little flexibility can do them     and love live formations always suck their dances heavily crutch on splitting up into threes and its so lazy and awkward     ive seen kpop groups with tons of girls have visually interesting and creative routines/formations
  same thing about dances  but kpop dances are actually professionally choreographed between kpop and jpop dances kpop is clearly better composed just from technique and synch  the fandom is trash tho
    i think you didnt read the subjective part and getting mad over nothing still wont change my opinion of them
    i asked if people would want riot to do a jpop/jidol style skins    i got chased off
  let me break it down for you anon    been feeling bad about her weight since she looks like she gained at least 50 lbs  keeps saying on ig that her confidence is low her teeth are shifting back to prebraces in some spots basically is finding something wrong in everything about herself  constant cry fests every time she cant have content ready for her monday uploads on ig garners herself some sympathy and hugboxiness to feel good  all her friends moved out of pa and have lives now  been doing nothing but playing final fantasy xiv nonstop for months to not be lonely  starts spending a shit ton of time roleplaying with other characters on her server   meets some 19 yr old eboy   starts to rp with him like the others  causes exbf to get jealous or her feelings to sway off of exbf unconfirmed which of the two or maybe its both   ex is a big pussy and was always super jealous any time she spoke to any male at all starts telling some friends that she cheated on him or was unfaithful  breakup somewhere in there  deletes her official insta and her private twitter ghosts fb for a month  comes back to fb after a while to show that she cut her hair because thats what the women in nihon do when their love ends  still ghosting social media just works and goes home to her friends online     heres the where is she now segment wont reveal her character or ig username so she doesnt get harassed on there  too far into rp on ffxiv  makes an ig for her character posts screenshots of character with captions that are either quotes that her character wouldve said or other rp garbage  posts pic of her character hugging a character that isnt her exbfs at one point saying she loves him probably previously mentioned eboy  her former guilds members all left recently she took a couple people from there and started a new one together with her as the leader  her title in the new guild is queen and she now roleplays as such    its just sad
follow your kokoro is disbanding after three years 
    why do the good ones always disband first but the mediocre ones continue to exist     but then again i am seeing a lot of ll cover groups disbanding this year as well due to the fact they were tied to their uni and school    well i wish them the best and hope new groups can meet the expectations for the sake of the fans
    she cut her hair my god she was proud of that  how much has come off    wow just wow shes really gone off on the deep end i know she was having trouble with her weight and meds but i didnt think everything got that bad     as much as she needs time to heal from the break up like any of us i hope she picks herself up and dusts herself off soon it cant be helping her to keep it up like this and is probably making things worse for her situation
what are these groups i havent seen a single good one    none of these girls seem to have dance theatre or any sort of stage experience oof how do they form or even find each other
  this is sad c shes clearly depressed
  its not super short a little below her collarbones it was below her waist for like 2 years at that point imo it didnt look good on her shorters better    but yeah shes been off her rocker for a while but now shes fallen into a bit of a deeper hole i think she looks to others for validation way too much and needs to just get some friends that she doesnt try to be the leader of and step back from everything even if she picks herself back up shes still got this big fish in a small pond dynamic in her life that keep her right where she is not growing or changing at all      been depressed more like it i think her bundles all sending her tons of good vibes and you can do it sort of messages wont help her either its a vicious cycle and trying to get nice messages and help from people who dont truly know you is harmful to your mental health rip
  there are decent ones but they dont usually get posted here     people complain on here about all the love live groups but also seem to exclusively post them for the most part when there are groups doing other stuff out there
    the odottemita topic did merge with the cringe dance and cosplay groups after all make sense that a majority of the videos will be cringe i can post the talented ones as much as possible but the decent performances are usually hidden away in bilibili/niconico unless someone rips the vids and uploads them elsewhere
  also some good/decent ones on insta but the covers are all shortened versions
  if you mean doing odottemita or doing amateur idol shows go for it i would suggest playing to your strengths and covering a more mature idol or group that is also in your age range trying to do lovelive or something cutesy like     if you mean actually going to japan to be an idol its not at all realistic unless you have some prior connections and/or fluent japanese not to mention a lot of idols dont make much money and have side jobs to make ends meet if you can actually sing and know fluent jp you might have a chance with an underground chika idol/altidol group with a wierd gimmick
    one clear example would be seishun who focus on foreigners and dansou two of their members went back to their home town to open the first overseas branch and do chika idol lives there along with regular appearances at festivals    but you are on the money on connections because the local scene has has enough people interested about idols in the con scene and passionate fans who went to japan to learn more about idols without that you wont get very far as the experience is an one way street since what good is bringing back the idol experience when reception is indifference or outright dislike thanks to years of a narrative condemning japanese idols and japanese idols alone
deannas fucking instagram account for her ff character im cackling i find this so weird especially because she has a nice law job as far as i know and shes almost 30i think shes just going through some shit right now but wow
    its a fairly good reminder that it can happen to any of us and why i will never get into an mmo its too easy to replace with reality and healthy habits/self care    i do wonder why none of her friends have given her a hefty pimpslap back into reality yet if they cared about her they wouldnt allow her to continue like this  even if they dont live near her anymore she still lives with family right im wondering if they have any idea how bad it is if it was me slipping into this downward spiral id want someone to knock some sense into me
  her friends actually seem to be encouraging it some of them even follow the account if you look through the followers on that account
  if they want to fuck thats their choice to do so as long as they dont bring mutant babies into the world
    it just goes to show what great friends they are in all seriousness this is depressing to hear because at this rate shell never get out of this funk in all likelihood shell make things worse for herself and itll get harder to fix
  i know some local groups that are real good and a couple have even started singing during performance but i dont post them her to keep the internet drama/stalkers/incels away
  was she dating that one larger guy who was always in her vlogs
    you mean greg i dont think so i dont think we ever saw him he seemed the most decent and likely to keep her head screwed on though
  she was dating lai/kite the asian dude that you may see show up here or there i think he was in one of her drunk pumpkin carving videos if youre curious
im kind of sad they seemed like a good/cute couple but im sad to see that it didnt work out
    i really like the chinese odottemita cosplayers they all look pretty professional in general yao ren mao was my first experience with odottemita in china        the good ones alway find half decent set to dance behind compared to the really cringy ones we have seen before
question for everyone to get some conversation happening but who are some net idols who you like or do not like but think they have potential as an idol due to personality or stage presence or who has a good voice but lacks the presence
  a lot of people i know think that paidashe usually gets mentioned here has the most potential to be an actual idol
  juliane almost has it all the look she can dance good even her stage presence is ok but her voice is like nails on a chalk board imo it sounds like she is yelling or whining i still think she has a lot of potential despite it
  people have already mentioned paida and julianne i think melancholiaah has potential and im also rooting for peachy parade though i wish they had more content cherry from citrus is a strong dancer so i see potential in her as well
i think they have potential  emma   peachy parade   amaitsuki  aidorujanai  iro bang  lulu dayou  natsuiro party  juliane
  paida and julianne for sure polaris from stellure is also good and that one girl who did the sakkaku crossroads cover from ages ago all of them are fantastic dancers and paidas vocals are just amazing mahoubunnie is super cute as well she has a charm to her that makes me overlook some of her flaws as a performer
    liking juliane/julily paida peachy parade and iro bang at the moment julianes been showing on social media that shes practicing a lot and i get the feeling shes working on something big right now idk      i wouldnt say she sounds that bad her live performances can get a little yelly because shes dancing a lot but her songs thatve been studio recorded sound alright she could definitely use vibrato though you do get some notes with nothing but air behind them and no movement in the pitch which can give you that unpolished sound
  i agree with what others have said mostly     a few others i see potential in that havent been mentioned yet     martha from parfait party  calina from morning sunrise  poppy from tambourine idols  alexpinku  san from love navigators    i think all of them have really good charisma that something that makes me wanna support them and they all have a good amount of talent too particularly martha
  ohhh i forgot about martha she is an angel i like calina ok but her voice is a bit too projected for me in her glass doll cover she sounds like shes yelling    id add citra from citresse but it looks like theyre inactive
looking at mimis instagram story i see shes concrunching stellure outfits once again i wonder when she will ever learn theyve had atleast 2 months or so to finish them too
      sees criticism for singers way better than me  guess ill quit      im confused by what peachy parade is doing they have potential and im rooting for them too but i wonder if they even care that much about it being successful since they dont really put much effort into having an online presence
  i like paida but as a real japanese idol i dont really think she has the looks to cut it
  they are like say a garage idol group to use an americanism they have fun tour perform but they arent in it for say glory or power
  she needs to learn that shit aint cute publically posting about mental breakdowns isnt what someone with mental breakdowns does
  no dont quit im jaded by being in theater
  i just saw their performance at animenyc and i think it turned out well definitely better than any of the other groups
  i actually loved it saw the stream haha their best song yet for sure if they went with a more rock direction in general it would be super cool
    i just watched the insta live and the quality is pretty bad so i cant get much of a sense of the song but the choreo actually looked pretty decent and the voices from what i could hear sounded more powerful and clear   i think they did well
    its definitely much better than what theyve put out so far my only issue is that they still havent seemed to connect the energy to the song or the dance/movements to the music for example the faux fight wouldve have much more bang had they put more energy into the movements as would the following mini group parts in addition some parts of the choreography still give off the cutesy idol vibe even though the song and outfits denote otherwise i am glad theyre adding more effort into their dances though vocally still a lot of the same but i still see some improvement too
 yeah you can tell that most of the notes in the song are too high for them and it sounds like their voices are being strained also im pretty sure this was supposed to be a callisto center song but mimi was still the focus most of the time she was front and center for 90 of the formations most of which involved her standing directly in front of callisto    about the choreo yeah they do need to put a lot more energy in but i also think they need to work on matching the choreo to the song more like you said since slowly walking side to side with your arms up doesnt really suit a song where the drum beats are hitting eighth notes i also feel like the   drumbeats were off with the other instruments and their vocals at points something just sounded off    also literally no one knew what beat they were supposed to move their hips on when they were all turned around haha
thinking back to a discussion that was brought up in the oic fb group about professionalism the amount of bitching callisto and mimi did on their insta stores about how the animenyc masquerade staff were rude was bad polaris and luna at least had the decency to just leave it at oh the masquerade was a bit stressful but otherwise i had a good time where as the other two basically said staff was rude and horrible to them which if its true yeah that sucks but maybe dont complain about it in a public setting even if it really was the most awful time with unprofessional staff its more important to keep yourself professional and now you just know not to go back to that event or you make a complaint in private directly to con staff
  all i saw from callisto was the attached which to me is nothing major were there more its not great but not necessarily totally unprofessional in comparison to a twitter thread i saw which was more or less a call out on how a group felt having been disrespected and how they felt unwanted at a different con         regardless i feel like these statements should be more prepared or not shared publicly at all
heres a question for you guys is there a net idol/ group that might seem really sweet online but was rude in person
  this is like the third jugde award in a row
im sure there have been occasions where guests have been treated badly by events but there is a professional way of doing it publicly shaking the event will turn them off from wanting to have you perform there again
  i went to a con where i was performing and there was a love live group they were egotistical and just didnt make us feel welcome at all as we had to share a dressing room we had a huge worktop where we could do make up and they have taken the whole area with their crap in the end we had to use a damn corner to squeeze in a dance rehearsal then when they performed badly they acted as if their performance was what the con was made for
  what con was that sorry you guys went through that
  i always worry im like this i try to be sweet and myself but i get easily overwhelmed which comes off as being grumpy i know ive lost my temper with people thatve tried to mess with me during hallway lives but when someone is actively trying to take your microphone or dance in front of you any wisdom on handling that sort of thing
  another dead group    not surprised
    i saw a video of a group dancing outside and a guy literally walked up to one of the dancers when she was middance all she did was ignore him and the audience heckled him to go away and he eventually did    my advice is to either ignore them because theyre either clueless and on the spectrum or they want to get a rise out of you if you have someone with you helping to setup and play music then try to have two and have a small cute hand signal that only they will know which means to get security/staff while the other watches your things    do not give them the reaction you want and when they disappear either dont mention it to your audience or make a joke out of it
  how so she looks like she maintains herself well enough
  i mean i think shes cute and should keep on doing what shes doing in america  just dont think the japanese would spend their money on her  her features arent really in her favor for a japanese audience if she slimmed up a little straightened her teeth perhaps shed have a shot but she should probably keep her activities to the usa i mean look at amina she had the looks but was only there about a year before becoming an escort instead
  its actually pretty common for former idols to become porn stars so im not surprised unfortunately the industry is pretty shady and a lot of girls get extorted for sex   which is why its a probably a good thing most net idols would get absolutely nowhere in japan
  define common besides a handful of 48 girls id wager less than 10 there havent been many more that have gone into the business its more likely the other way around like with ebisu muscats they became idols after already being av idols
  yeah honestly i dont think they go into av as much as a lot of japanese idols go into things like gravure photobooks but gravure is rather tasteful and not like av at all
  amina could never sing for shit and she never seemed to improve paida has a completely different energy from amina and there is no way you can compare the two just because they are black i dont think any aspiring black or poc idol should be looking up to amina shes a piss example of an idol and lacks talent i find it bloody disgusting how many black girls idolize her i used to be one of them    paida is on the right path i want to believe that she wont end up like her
lets chat  what was the first dance you did when you started  what was the first dance you performed in front of other people
  very late but this is also a matter of preference i like both their voices very much calina reminds me of my favorite million live idol umi kousaka     a lot of people find a forceful voice very cute even unpolished
  when i was a wee lad of just a mere 14 i thought itd be a great idea to start off with doki doki morning from babymetal first dance on stage was 5 years later and was loveless world
    the first dance i learned was probably either the hare hare yukai if that even counts or kokoro no tamago however the first one i performed in front of other people was ready from the idolmster
  tried to learn pon pon pon when i was in my weeb phase never finished it though the first jpop dance i performed in front of an audience was mermaid festa vol 1 if non jpop counts i performed an original choreo to an old britt nicole song for a church thing
  thats nice but she still doesnt have the looks for a japanese audience amina did
  it was like 2007 and i was at a con doing endless oldass jpop songs think like oooold morning musume and berryz kobo i think i did renai revolution like 20 times that weekend kinda miss cons being the way they were
      wow i wish i hadnt looked her up wtf did i just watch
  edgy tm
    isnt that the group that made the original maimai tonight with realizing its an ondo    i have seen better original choreos than that one    
  more commonly heard of than in kpop at least i remember hearing that japanese fans of boa wanted her to star in porn and korean fans were super offended but youre correct its mostly former akb48 or their sister groups members
  definitely one of their better songs but the choreography looks pretty messy also those fishnets are not flattering whatsoever
  yikes wtf is that wwii imagery
  i like the fishnets theyre very kfashiony but i dont mind them at all
  i want to like this because its so close to good but in the end it falls short i dont know how they always manage to sound so bland and emotionless in their recordings     the choreography is okay but not well executed     and i love a tacky costume but even i cant get behind these theyre overdesigned and unflattering
soooo who wants to share the tea on sakurahana
  what tea
  if i remember correctly korea barely has a porn industry and if they do its illegal also you severely missed my point it wasnt that its mostly akb members its that it barely happens period most ex idols either go talento solo or back to normal life a very small percent become porn stars
  she was kicked out of the oic discord and facebook
  man i totally missed whatever it was im guessing it happened on the discord after reading through her tellonyms im so curious but im too embarrassed to directly ask those involved
  you didnt miss anything if you remember how she was kicked out of that amino the same thing happened with oic     self loathing people give advice everyone called her out for not listening to advice she cried that people hate her getd kicked out threatens to quit being an idol or delete her instagram and goes back to normal days or hours later
  this is correct as almost all kpop idols continue to be managed by their companies if they leave their group/the group disbands  however one notable exception is honey popcorn the kpop group comprised of former javactresses
  i remember mimi complaining about the colors on the hip piece not matching because the orange was too bright and i agree it sticks out like a sore thumb    not to mention how are they able to make all their lyrics sound like they were badly translated from japanese to english there is no flow or rhythm to them
leaving out most of the replies because it was almost all wellmeaning advice without coddling her too much you can figure it out from context also trying to protect everyone elses info and private thoughts from cgl
      as someone who barely goes on the server i didnt notice this even happened but even looking at her older tellonyms when she was first posted i was not surprised that was the outcome at all many of her new tellonyms are making the members of oic that tried to help her look really bad in an unfair way i dont say this often but she needs help and to be admitted or attend intense therapy because she has a lot of deep rooted issues that she needs to work out     to an extent though i do think shes primarily attention seeking yes she could also be this way but her way of making excuses isnt consistent with someone who actually wants to try its consistent with someone who doesnt want to try and get attention for being sad
  what does oic stand for  are there facebook groups for people interested in idol stuff besides the love live ones
  yeah i left her a tellonym saying i hope she gets the help she needs it took me being admitted to a mental facility to break me out of that same mindset
  it stands for overseas idol collection its a net idol not love live groups actual idols resource and community site ran by juliane
    sakura hana  can she be saved    turns out no
  honestly im really relieved she was so hard to deal with constantly posting putting herself down and then when you gave her genuine heartfelt responses she basically blew you off i wonder if she even realizes that when someone types you up a paragraph trying to help you and you respond with basically  i cant excuses none of that helps that is rude as crap
  i feel like its almost as if it was a mistake to let her in in the first place maybe the mods/admins were just trying to be nice but clearly this girl has no actual grasp of what real idol culture is i mean for christ sakes she keeps talking about comparing herself to nico
this is so sad people are thinking oic bullied her out i wish people would open their eyes and see how toxic sakura really is
  anyone who buys into her bullshit has gotta be just as bad if this keeps them away from oic  thank god
    funny enough former 48g members and their music is remarkably tame it is like their stint in jav have not affected their music    this is one of most mixed feelings i have about jidols in general is the fact they dont end up like a disney teen stars music career where they go slowly from all wholesome to being extremely adult popstars
  can i just    bts and perfume two groups with very detailed dances girl of course you wouldnt be able to do those right away those take lots of practice    it honestly just sounds like shes young and has no idea how much freedom shes going to have when she gets older with a job shes comparing herself to people who are older and work in order to be able to afford this hobby/lifestyle
i dont mean to roast sakura hana but she kind of sounds like a female version of chrischan when she talks
random question but has anyone audition for superrareproductions yet
  holy shit she is 16 isnt she i get it that shes annoying as shit its obvious by the screen caps but for fucks sake you didnt have to cuss at her and make her look as bad as you all made her out to be she seems very attentionseeking but many kids her age are and im sure many of you idols can you really call yourselves that after this shit were just the same at that age    from an outsider looking in it is apparent you were dealing with a really frustrating kid but that language was absolutely uncalled for and the way you handled the situstion by getting everyone involved was disgustingly unprofessional im glad i never submitted to the fb group looks like a group of mobmental bitches they make overseas idols and overseas idol fans look like a fucking joke the simple thing to do would have been to give her a private explanation on why she was being removed and boom problem solved     getting multiple members to gang up on her is so childish you guys look like youre stuck in highschool if you need to get a whole group of people im assuming many of who are adults to mob up on a kid then you need serious help i saw some of them when i was at awa but i didnt suspect theyd be like that i guess you really cant judge a book by its cover oic looks like a cringe corner
  reading back at the message history on the server they only really ganged up on her when she said that she was like nico and no one encouraged people to gang up on her it kinda just happened since people were stuck there for 9 hours straight trying to give her advice that she wasnt accepting guess that triggered people
  you probably have the privilege to never deal with someone like her or your just as toxic and immature as she is unless you were there and saw the full conversations you really have no right to be commenting about the situation like you are     one admin gave sakura two major warnings and several chances after she private messaged the admin begging for chances
  while im not condoning some of what happened i feel like youve never really been in a situation where you tried to help someone asking for help and their response was always i cant do this because of xyz i dont think anyone is trying to make her look bad either i have screen caps of the whole situation and if i ever decide to edit them and post i think it tells a different story compared to whats been posted since so many people were involved and trying to help not only that but this isnt a one off thing theres a lot posted in support of her from her first vent 11/19 i dont think anyone is trying to make her look bad not like shes trying to make them look bad     its not a mob mentality as much as it is someone who refuses to take advice being frustrating is one thing thats bareable whats unbearable is someone who absolutely wholeheartedly refuses to take advice we saw with hoshi teruko who always made the same or similar excuses nobody was ganging up on her until she decided to pull a why does everyone hate me i am listening but    theres honestly nothing toxic about oic its a place created from truly wanting to expand the base and share the culture its not some kind of elitist club     if youre basing your view of oic this situation then of course youre going to see them as a bad place but its not that
  it may have been my poor choice of editing but i wasnt any of the people involved in the screencaps so addressing me like i orchestrated this is moot there wasnt one person getting everyone involved i apologize if the screencaps i grabbed made it look like there were     i left most of the replies out to protect everyones anonymity and because there was a shit ton of discussion and this would have been dozens of pages long this wasnt an instance of ganging up this was literally 9 hours of sakura venting about how shitty she felt and offering excuses as to why she couldnt follow anyones advice and everyone else in the server trying to help her     lots of people shared personal stories of their own struggle tried to gently convince her to get help and tried to reassure her without seeming enabling or coddling i admit some people did get mean at the end but that wasnt a concentrated instance of ganging up or bullying those were a few individuals that got frustrated and fed up after trying to help for nine hours straight if you interpret that as oic is a bunch of bullies then theres not much i can say to convince you otherwise but youre wrong
  and just to drive the point in i went back and grabbed a sample of what was happening in that server for those 9 hours this is the bullying shes crying about on her ig story this is why she thinks everyone in the oic hates her
  i need to get my stuff recorded and sent in haha
  same here i only realized that i dont have any lines to read for the va part i only have snip recordings of auditions i joined i wish you luck annon
  i auditioned too and recorded the next day i spent a big chunk of the day deciding on what before just defaulting to ll scripts in eng  jpn since theyre easily accessible compared to others
has anyone here applied for oics mentorship program
sakura hana is creating her own spinoff of oic called international idol community
yes create your own group of coddlers because none else is willing to    in all seriousness please spread awareness of her i was friends with her but stopped because she is very manipulative and toxic
  not going to release any screenshots but ill say this  these screenshots of supportive messages were like 90 of what was being said to sakura the ones posted above where people got fed up were very few and far between and only really popped up at the end of several days worth of people trying to help her and having their wellthoughtout advice ignored    the admins stepped in right after people all got frustrated and removed her rather than pming her or giving a warning because as mentioned before she had already gotten two private warnings and this gave her a third strike    i thought it was all handled pretty well overall several people in oic have reached out to her to let her know that if she still wants to look for advice that theyd be willing to be there for her so she really does have a willing support system as long as shes ready to reach out to them and accept their help
        i know shes a kid but this is just a whole new level of petty for her
im so sick of it i want her to learn a lesson and have all her supporters see the screenshots posted above how can we go about it
wow the sakura hana fanpage runners abandoned their instagram account saying there no longer fans shouldnt that be a wake up call to her
  wait she had a fanpage lol
  she did was 100 sure her sister made it until i saw 
oic callout post from a sakura hana fan
  holy shit whats the account name
  its abandoned and all the post are gone theres really nothing left of it being her fan page anymore
so quick thought has anyone ever seen sakura hanas sibling that claims to be her sibling on instagram did they post photos of themself because i find it funny that she says they share a phone/both post on each others instagrams and are always one second behind the other   also her siblings instagram says they love hatsune miku but besides love live thats all i hear sakura talk about jpop wise i dont think sakura has a sibling i think she has these two accounts to make her seem a little more realistic and she can back up her own words and make it seem more reliable also a lot of her tells are herself trying to make it look like people really support her
sakura catfishing her followers as her sister lol a thought
  there is someone who says they are her sister and they have posted on her story theres a video of her somewhere in that mess
  first two posts are 2d idolsgreat start i see
  apparently theyre not actually blood related though
yeah theyve mentioned theyre just best friends who are like they are sisters or something surprisingly the sister is almost more cringe than sakura going by her rants i cant wait till these girls are 20 and look back on all this stuff the cringe will be real
juliane must be rolling around in cringe right now oic being so blatantly ripped off man sakura had to make it worse by making it even cringe
  honestly i wonder if they even know maybe someone tipped them off but according to sakura almost everyone in oic has blocked her more likely she blocked them so theyd have no idea
  interlunium recasted for their lead she hasnt performed in a song with them yet but her solo stuff makes me think ill prefer her over the old cv
  whos the new va
  shes one of the vas for the rival group
  gotcha dont know how the new va sounds but im going to miss takara i really liked her voice
i went through takaras twit feed a little bit and found two interesting curiouscats
  second one here then a little later she mentioned that her dms are only open to commissions or something because of nasty messages
  if she was enforced by someone else obviously something went down
  hey anon i definitely get being young and annoying i was definitely there just not at 16 maybe like 8 16 is immature yes but too old to condone behavior like that its manipulative and exploitive when she comments things like that she thinks shes inherently not as good as the other girls and wants those girls to encourage her that she is good without putting in the same work thats why she is going to deflect all advice she doesnt want it she wants to magically be the idol the others are without the work money and process    again shes 16 not a 6 year old she should be able to handle backlash handle swear words angry people or holding herself accountable yeah i dont like the idea of idols cussing or telling of someone like that but its not like they were insulting her or bullying her shes old enough to handle that nonsense and even if she couldnt shes old enough to learn     tired of this hand holding mentality shes not in kindergarten no one was there to hold my hand at 16 and i delt with all the backlash at my cringe on my own
  isnt she the one that started the group or am i remembering things wrong
  no mom0ki junkos va started the group
i think its time for a new thread
  one of the other cvs posted the screenshot where takara claimed she was kicked out without her knowledge and informed their followers that takara was informed shed be leaving before any announcement was made i think that cv later took their tweet down to avoid any conflicts since their both under contract i think mom0ki stated somewhere that there were personal conflicts between the two that ultimately led up to her departure but that was deleted from the questions channel from what i remember seems complicated
  it feels like takara said something without the right meaning because she was emotional at the time i hope shes okay but the misinformation is unfortunate on her part
  hello im part of an idol group we promote as idols and not as love live/imas cover group     we are looking for a new member to join us however our community is filled with toxic and young people and/or in other groups we hate the idea of making a public scouting post as it can bring in unfavourable people to join us people who might not mesh well with us etc we want your opinion on how we should go about looking for a new member    we thought about private scouting to help us find people but think going through an audition can be intimidating  so thoughts
  i dont think auditions are really all that intimidating i can understand how anxiety might make one feel that way though personally as a group leader i find it to be one of the better ways to scout members as you can gauge someones level of commitment to your group from the get go using an audition did they learn a new dance/song cover just for this audition or just upload/rerecord an old one did they coordinate a good location for their dance cover so their video looks visually stunning or is it a sloppy bedroom people who take the time and effort to put a lot into just an audition not even knowing theyll get in or not can often times be the best/most committed members private scouting can yield decent results as your searching within a small social circle but ive found that recruiting friends can often make people lazy because they get into the mindset that they wont be kicked out for being a lazy shit because youre friends with them and dont wanna hurt their feelings
  wait so which one is takara in the group
  takara was the center/face rinko
  just do auditions the type of performer who is put off by having to properly audition isnt who you want in your group anyways     and if no one good auditions then you could resort to trying to privately scout theres really no down side unless you just really dont wanna put in the effort to put together an audition
  my group as well has kind of run dry in terms of people wanting to audition as weve held them for 3 years now after the major con that happens for us locally and at this point our group has kind of already accepted everyone we want/the people that keep repeatedly audition we are not accepting for good reason for now were taking a more relaxed approach and allowing people who want to join for only certain performances or covers to do so and also like others have already mentioned just doing private scouting via our invitation only     dont be afraid to hold auditions it will really show who is willing to put in the effort and who isnt
  i mean this as nicely as possible but i think you need to grow a pair and just hold auditions just because someone you dont like applies doesnt mean you have to accept them they dont know what goes on behind the scenes or who you are looking for i also second the comments kind of pointing out that auditions take effort and with your own rules you can find what you need in a member anxiety sucks but youll be fine
  as others have kind of already alluded to people who dont like auditions are the same people who dont want to work for something its like if a person wants to be an actress gets an agent but never wants to go to auditions what do they think will happen theyll just get a role
new thread 
new thread banned because cringe sakurahana white knights what happened lol
  i guess we just make another one i dont know did the new thread even mention sakura at all
  i think for a second and then some chicks popped up demanding we stop making threads about her no one did at this point if they want us to be such bad guys why not just start reporting her account
next thread just dont mention her at all
  just make a lolcow thread so we can discuss her
  thank you for tips everyone i think the major fear was honestly the community we are part of its large and very very toxic so rumors are bound to spread about us being too good for anyone or something like that but youre right if people really care about joining they will audition will update
  untill she does something cringy again which would be in a week or 2 at most
new thread got taken down again
wtf why nothing stupid was even going on there
    i honestly feel like youknowwho is responsible we werent even discussing them maybe they just think the whole thing is bullying people grow some skin for fucks sake
this is dumb but aight play the immature game i guess
  can we try for another thread i wanted to know if anyone ended up applying for sr productions
  i did but i didnt make it to the second round really bummed but maybe another similar opportunity will present itself one day
  i made it to round two fingers crossed
  what character were you going for i wish there was a discord or something where we could discuss this   im really hoping i make it in
  im curious how soon they will start casting the email doesnt give a deadline for submitting your callback stuff so will they wait for all current callbacks to come in before deciding even more complicated since more people could be sending in auditions and getting call backs everyday makes me more anxious
is there a discord for dance covers besides oics theyre definitely more about original content and discourage stuff like cosplay covers so i feel like there should be one thats more general and hobbyist and covers a wide variety of songs love live idolmaster nonanime idols etc
  well they said initially theyre accepting people as auditions come
how do you feel about idols performing in cosplay
  i have seen people in oic post anime idol dance covers but not in cosplay as long as its not a cosplay cover since oic is trying to seprate itself and the idol community from the cosplay community people really dont care
  i feel like someone asks this every thread lol  can we have a new thread
  if /cgl/ lets us it would be our third try im getting worried that this might be the end
  i got called back for lara and amelie and was initially auditioning for lara
why is no one talking about pizza yolo and their awful name
  the first one was taken down because of a certain someone and her friends spamming the thread  the second one being taken down might have had something to do with the molestation allegations  i really wish the threads could have just been pruned of the offending posts rather than being deleted altogether but i guess this is what were dealing with now    i think any major drama or whatever ought to be redirected to the lolcow farms maybe in a thread for the net idol community in general if there isnt one already       i always look forward to honey himes projects but yeah i have mixed feelings about the subunits name i spent a bit a of time trying to figure out if yolo meant something different in italian but didnt find anything does the groups name literally mean pizza you only live once    i do like the idea of a pizzathemed italian idol group though sounds silly and fun like hamburgirl z
    cosplay covers is how i got into a lot of songs i have never heard before i said once and i will say it again it is the best way to expose newbies to music they havent known about before
  lolcow has a european net idol thread but not a general net idol thread i tried posing on there but none would shut up about kelsey beckii and friends
  the cloest conclusion i can come to is its suppose to sound like pizzaiolo which is italian for a person who makes pizzas the name pizza yolo might be a play on words or sounds similar but cuter
    isnt that just for uk ones anyway but even then yeah it is mostly just those bunch im sure a netidol thread would be accepted
previous thread     ask all your lolita and other jfash questions here for any cosplay questions your best bet is the cosplay help thread
ill start does anyone know where the watch button on lm went it suddenly disappeared for me and its just not there for some reason my watchlist still exists
  its still there for me on desktop using multiple browsers did you accidentally adblock it or something try opening it in a different browser or incognito mode and see what happens
i am a us shoe size 7 would getting a us size 8 be too big the shoes i desperately want are only available in a size 8 halp
  is it a flat or high heel  idk how true it is but growing up i always heard it was better to size up on a heel
  probably but you can always add an insert and that might help
  they are sneakers
  yeah for sneakers sizing up is fine because you can control how tight it is
    thanks i appreciate the help
anyone know what the deal is with ordering from innocent world i placed an order over a week ago and havent heard back except for the confirmation email
any tips or things i should be aware of for ironing jacquard    really want to straighten out the creases from shipping on a jacquard ap jsk i just got in the mail
  a few days ago i asked about shipping clothes/items from japan to america in /fa/ and about if the website doesnt shit internationally etc and one of you said something about japonica and im quite interested but i dont know much about it and kinda need a link if the anon who suggested me this is still here pls help and if anyone else have other good sites for this kinda stuff lmk im also kinda interested in zenmarket if any of u know more about that aswell    /fa/ told me to post here so pls help ty
im making a cosplay of a lolita character and i thought about adding a real lolita touch by wearing brand otks    so im wondering where i could find some pastel blue brand otks and if they are very expensive    pic related thats my character
i have big bobs and dont think getting into lolita is a good idea am i correct to assume this i am a 30f2436
  buy a steamer  but if youre a poorfag or lazy you should iron all delecate clothing like this  take dress  put on flat surface  take white cotton or other fabric that does not melt bedsheet/fabric  make bedsheet slightly damp  place bedsheet on top of dress  iron dress through the protective safeguard of dampish cotton  i would rather die than risk putting hot iron on my dresses
  if the website doesnt shit internationally  my sides anon
  japonica market is really good in my experience gulls have said that they favor returning customers ive been using them since 2014 and theyve been perfect every time but i cant tell you if its because im a returning customer or not theyre a personal shopping service so they can buy off websites that other shopping services cant  zenmarket is generally really good really low fees 300 yen for every item you buy no fees for the first item you order through them hold onto your items for 45 days for free and have a variety of shipping options only downside is that theyre pretty slow but theyre my goto ss for auctions etc      brands have released sax otks in the past youll likely have to look for a pair secondhand which can take a while assuming you can find one at all imo youre better off wearing off white or white socks instead itll be easier to find and easier to match too  baby has a pair of knee socks in stock right now   and metas otks are in stock too 
  you are correct
  nah my measurements arent toodifferent from what yours are and i fit in most pieces just fine your measurements seem to indicate someone thats skinny with big boobs and not just general plus size so things will probably be easier than you think    you might have to be a bit more choosy than what someone of your size with smaller boobs would have to be but as long as you check the measurements thoroughly before buying anything you should be okay    a sports bra or compression shirt might be helpful to create a more flattering shape for some pieces and keep in mind that some brands are more forgiving than others when it comes to the fit around the bust     in my personal experience the hardest part of being a busty lolita is finding nice quality blouses that fit both my bust and my waist but that isnt the worst thing
  youre skinny so no my measurements are nearly the same and while i can fit in a lot of brand normally i usually wear a chest binder or a really strong minimizer / sports bra for a flatter silhouette more due to personal taste
  baby only has black with white lace available atm so i doubt thatll work
reposting from last thread  i bought some items from one spos sale a week ago using fromjapan and my order is still pending even though the sale has ended im uncertain if they purchased the items during the sale period some stuff was 3070 off should i expect an invoice for full price
  white is in stock in the link i gave maybe look closer before you jump to conclusions
  where can i get some good quality lace tights with gothish patternsroses crosses etc i wear tights daily id prefer if they didnt rip after just putting them on like the sheer normie ones do
is there anyway to wear a short sleeved blouse w puffy sleeves  a cardigan without it bunching up  looking ugly probably not but i thought i would ask /
i would like to try lolita but i defenetly dont want to look like a degenerate fuck im 6 and around 210 punds should i give up or there is hope for me
is there a taobao replica of these shoes from iw or something similar or rather i should ask if people have seen good looking wine heels ive been needing a deeper red shoe for coords pretty bad but everything secondhand doesnt fit or is awfully damaged or is hideous i dont really want to buy brand ones new as they just dont hold up for their price    a pair of these shoes are taunting me on mercari being in the wrong size but such a good price    unless does anyone know if iws heels run small i have a pair of size m boots from them and it feels like they run a bit big
  have you checked lizjill on taobao
im trying to put together my first cord to wear out but im having some troubles mostly w the bottom half of the cord i have a full set but i dont really like how the otks look w the cord it clashes w too much print for my taste so i was looking for some insight as what else i could do tt
    japonica      zenmarket  wwwzenmarketjp/    fromjapan  ttps//wwwfromjapancojp/en/    they all work differently look through their websites and read carefully basically you give them a link pay them  they buy the items you specify and then ship it to you
    if youre willing to post photos coord help thread  will be able to help suggest things    if youre doing conventional lolita ie not one of those ott princess or one of those borderline softloli coords then plain white lacetopped otks or utks would work match them to your blouse colour    my fallback is usually lace tights also matched to the blouse colour theyre easy to get off taobao for most colours the lace gives enough texture so it doesnt look too cheap and boring
    look imma be honest here if you pretty much look like crap in normie fashion or any other fashion then youll look like crap in lolita too     6ft and fat can work in lolita muumuus and long underskirts are in between that full shirring adjustable shoulder straps custom taobao/indie you can definitely find stuff that will fit you     its just if youre also ugly lazy ungroomed poor/cheap dont have a clue how to look good unwilling to learn unwilling/unable to take the extra work/cost to find/alter things to fit lolita isnt going to solve any of that so pretty much if you cant already look good outside of lolita youre not going to look any better in lolita either at least learn to look somewhat presentable and decent in normie fashion before you try for lolita    hope that helped you somewhat
  sometimes it takes 2 weeks they are slow especially during sales but have always gotten back eventually for me
  ive been thinking about it but im pretty nervous to self post so ill probably make a college or set everything i have in mind for it out  get a pic of that the dress is dolly cat in the pink colorway im definitely not trying to do anything remotely ott for my first cord i just want to be simple but look good/put together decently tt i have pic related coming in the mail do you think they would look okay over some white tights
does anyone know how accurate the sizing on ozz ons website is  it seems remarkably generous for unshirred and normal sized looking clothing  picture is one of the items im looking at
  white tights  if you absolutely have to layer them on top of tights  instead of solid white try something like pic related theyre subtle but cute and they work with the dot tulle lace on your main piece
  man that sucks has the item you ordered ever sold out during that time thats my main concern
  nayrt but yes thats happened to me a few times im actually waiting for confirmation myself its been nearly two weeks now and i suspect ill get an email notifying me that my item has sold out instead  hope for the best anon i hope you get your order
  the best way to do this is to wear a blouse or cutsew with smallish puff sleeves and a bolero with wider sleeves on top not an easy task because neither is very common but its possible if youre careful about the items you pick
    due to the eyecatching pink ruffle on the top of the socks theyll work better without white tights underneath    dolly cat is pretty perfect for it if you keep the rest of your coord white and pink as well but make sure there isnt a huge gap between where the skirt ends and where the socks begin ideally you want just a little bit of skin showing if you want to be sexy or none at all
  oh wow never heard of that taobao shop thanks anon they dont have this exact shoe model but they definitedly have something that will work thanks again    if anyone knows if iw heels run small or not id still love to hear
i think this is related    anyway trying to curb my jfashion spending habits ive been spending a lot of money on cute clothes and i cant stop lol    any tips for online shopping addiction i check brand pages all the time and im not sure if i really want to give up knowing whats being released
  id suggest steering clear of any shopping sites and maybe just sticking to brands twitter accounts to see their updates unless that alone prompts you to buy things in which case i dont know what else you can do other than completely avoiding updates on new releases
  that is really cute thank you anon ill look around for a pair also a bit worried about cold weather though but hopefully the socks will keep me warm
  do you wear bloomers you should if you dont they dont seem like much but its an additional layer that can keep you warm
  i would perfer for no skin to be showing especially since its pretty cold where i live now  im just more comfortable that way though the dress is a bit short on me since the cut i have isnt the higher wasited one
  i have a pair but they are a bit big on me  peak out more than i would like them to i wish they were just a little bit shorter know anywhere i can get a decent priced pair fast
  if youre not in too much of a hurry you should look in the secondhand market metas bloomers pop up for sale all the time there  this pair for example is simple and very cute 
  youre supposed to size down on a high heel not up
  ozz on is prett small it fits better on small girls than small men
  ozz on uses materials with quite a lot of stretch they look best on small people but will fit surprisingly large
  that looks really cute thank you anon for the help do u have a discord or anything of the sort
  i do have a discord but id rather stay anonymous sorry glad to help though i hope your coord turns out well
  its ok i understand thank you
order something from youvimi after hearing some good things about it  turns out the item i want is out of stock after i placed an order for it  they send me an email letting me know  tell them i want a refund  23days later  no response  did i get scammed gulls
    id do skincoloured tights if you totally need them or the sheer ones another anon linked above if you really need white tights chose different printed socks that dont have the ruffle thats what makes it weird to wear tights under the socks as it obviously marks where the socks end    seconding bloomers for keeping you warm too
      kind of want to chime in on this advice im not sure how original anon feels but when it comes to lolita i rarely buy brand new so staying up to date with releases isnt too difficult for me what really gets me is browsing second hand and seeing that one item i really want come up a lot of them are older rare and you dont see them often so it feels like that impending now or never type of purchase     anyways taking a break from browsing second hand really helped to curb my shopping with newer releases they feel plentiful so it isnt as urgent that you purchase hope this helps
i feel like this is relevant for this thread not sure where else to put this brand blouses fit my torso just fine but fitted ones tend to be tight around my upper arms i also have broader shoulders which doesnt help my case would low weight lifting do anything to help my case or would putting on muscle make things worse i typically only really do cardio to keep in shape but im starting to feel sad when i buy cute blouses only for it to look atrocious when i put it on
    thank you for the replies i think youre both right i own some second hand brand myself but as i like to make larger orders at a time second hand orders end up being as expensive if not more than buying one or two items new i think ill just do my best to limit looking around mercari for now
  just got an email  we can refund but it will cost both of us costly fees  you bitches put an item up you didnt even have waited two days to tell me you didnt even have it and basically tricked me i dont want your discounts i dont want your 20 necklace i want my money back all of it jesus
  contact paypal or your bank/institution that issued the card you paid with threaten them with a chargeback
  oh shit of course thank you
    awesome thanks for your help
i just got a pair of ap shoes secondhand that are in much worse condition than i thought  can i use paint to fix them  if so which kind im all down for paint mixing too
what is the best shop to get nice quality custom sized blouses from ive only been happy with the quality of materials on a couple of the stores ive bought from
is it possible to ship second hand items from wunderwelt together with new items from wunderwelt fleur  i tried finding information on their website but apparently im completely blind
  yeah you can it tells you in the cart that its fine the only thing is some fleur reservation items cannot and those say in the item itself
  thats great thank you so much
  angelus leather paints are good and very mixable
  mai a cute brands have released pastel blue otks but it would be easier to find white its been years since a brand has released saxxwhite lacetopped socks and pastel blue striped socks are also no longer common iirc she wears white legwear most of the time in the anime so id suggest something like these      im linking the lacetopped kneehighs since the otks are out of stock in white but from personal experience angelic prettys lacetopped socks are longer and stretchier than most brands so they might actually go otk on you if youre not that tall    maxicimam also have a few pairs in stock but these are all definitely utk      
  a bra size doesnt tell us as much as your bust measurement but youre probably fine im a 28/30f and can still fit some unshirred victorian maiden brands like ap and meta go way bigger than that      if the cardigan is stretchy enough i stick my arms up the sleeves to pull the blouse sleeves and the ruffle down and flat if the cardigan is a thicker material this usually hides most of it
    thank you so much for the advice some of those are perfect and now i have a better idea on what could work perfectly for this outfit    have a great day
  how are you supposed to fit them then i take the same size in flats and heels assuming its the same brand with same fit never heard about this changing size thing except for obviously some shoe companies or styles running larger/smaller
  weights wont make you smaller doing strength training will complement cardio for keeping in shape but you cant spot reduce your arms and you do run the risk of adding muscle bulk
  what character is this anon shes cute

has ap got some kind of novelty going around i bought horror candy shop in the sale and tenso has not only got the price of the dress wrong 22260 yen instead of 24040 yen but they also say i have a misc item valued at 0yen that i need to value i only ordered the one dress and nothing else not sure if theyve just made a mistake with the invoice value or if i have someone elses dress by mistake or a novelty gift or something their contact page isnt letting me submit anything and im too paranoid to change the value and pay to ship it out in case its not my dress and is someones jsk instead or something help gulls
what is the general concensus on wearing chunky goth boots think your basic stompy demonia with gothic lolita do normal lolita shoe rules apply still or does the gothic influence make that acceptable ive seen mixed opinions
  really depends on the style of the boots/shoes anon
    there is this     i thought itd be long over by now but maybe they had some extras left over hoping thats that and not tenso counting the plastic bag as an extra
  youll never have a general consensus on anything opinions vary especially here just throwing that out there  anyway i think it can be done depending on the coord imo it looks best in old school but even then you need to know what youre doing to make it work   if you already have good lolita pieces and the chunky boots you want to wear with them you can try it and see if it works for the coords you had in mind no harm in experimenting
  i love chunky goth boots with literally everything not that id post it online basic bitches would rip me a new one  pic related
  surface spell have had the best construction of the taobao blouses i bought theirs and dear celines which dont custom size have been the only taobao blouses i was really satisfied with i do also have a blouse from parity night i really like but i cant make a judgement on their quality overall because ive not seen any other item from them in person whereas ive had several different dc and surfacespell blouses in the past and theyve all been good    so that you know what im comparing to most of my blouses are baby with some moitie maxicimam vm and old ap and iw
i have monkey arms so longsleeved brand blouses and dresses are pretty much useless to me does anyone know where i can get blouses with long sleeves that are a little longer than others
  i dont know but if you wear himesleeves itll still look good if theyre too short
have yall ever washed holy lantern i doesnt have anything on the dress it just has been worn out on the trains etc and it needs a wash any advice the flocking makes me nervous
  vm and moitie often have longer sleeves longer than the brand average in any case if that helps
has anyone ever bought taobao lolita shoes off ebay if so do you know if they buy the shoes off taobao and send it to you or do they replicate them how is the quality im currently interested in a pair that was originally from sosic shop but i dont want to have to go through a shopping service just for one pair of shoes but i also dont want to buy it off ebay if im going to get a really bad replica
  the blouses on the vm blouse i have are shorter than average and the two moitie ones are pretty much normal
  oh maybe you need to look for specific pieces in that case  i have a moitie blouse with 65cm long sleeves and ive come across vm blouses with equally long sleeves unless thats not long enough for you in which case have you tried wearing wrist cuffs to make your sleeves look longer
  im not the anon you originally replied to the blouses fit me fine but im a shortie both moitie blouses i have are 66cm but so are some baby blouses i own with similar cuts to the sleeve the vm blouse i have only has 60cm sleeves
does anyone know where to get these long cardigans specifically in that color shown in the picture
  ive had good luck getting hem from both amazon and ebay probably could the same thing cheaper on taobao no idea both i got were the exact same but from different sellers so they obviously got them from somewhere else great quality and 1516 bucks each with free shipping
  what did you search up anon just long cardigan
  school cardigan japanese uniform cardigan stuff like that the seller i bought from on both platforms doesnt have the listing anymore or id just link that but they had similar pictures to this listing  although the price on this is quite high and it doesnt seem to have the color you want these were the exact pics the sellers i bought from used
so i just had an extremely negative buying experience regarding undisclosed stains with a user in the lolita community ive already posted reviews on lm and in the vetted discord is this something that i can/should post here or is that taking it to vendetta levels pic related is one of the four stains on the front of the dress
  tenso counting the plastic bag as extra  lol i forgot about the plastic bags itd be hilarious if that was it im not really getting my hopes up for any kind of novelty but it seems like it is the right dress at least i guess ill find out when it arrives
  holy shit name and shame
  cry when you realize that i paid 300 for a like new worn once dress i eventually got my refund butanyway theres a whole story what thread would be most appropriate
do i need to wear a petticoat under a skirt like this brand is nile perch i just got one in the mail and i realize that the material is thin enough to see my blouse tucked into it underneath perhaps i should wear a slip or would a petti be proper for this styleattain additional poofage
    anything that isnt lolita doesnt need a petticoat lolita is the only fashion that actually requires petticoats     you just wear a petticoat if it looks better with one try on the skirt and if it looks like a limp cabbage wrapped around your legs then definitely get a petticoat and stick it under there or if you simply like the shape better with a petti then wear one    it does sound like you at least need a slip even if youre not wearing a petticoat though
has anyone had experience with washing aps classic fairy tales in wine i heard someone say in passing that the wine colorway bleeds really badly so im a bit wary    unrelated but what should i search on taobao to find rhs/what shops have good ones
  if you got the refund then whats the story
  she initially refused to offer anything but a 20 refund i was willing to keep it if she refunded like 75 and take my chances with dry cleaning but she kept telling me to be reasonable she couldnt figure out how to refund me properly sent it goods and services so i had to refund her the refund and wait another four days while bugging her to send it i had to eat the cost of sending it back to her in australia so there goes another 35 its a whole thing
  you might be able to find the shop that had bodyline factory replicas in the catalog they had their rose rhs
does anyone know where i can find those really floofy crimped wigs and also good twin tail wigs that isnt gothic lolita wigs
  second naming and shaming if not for yourself then for other lolitas who might end up spending money on shit that is gross
  wait who i bought a dress that was shitier than described from australia a few weeks ago   she offered 20 before i received it but after i got it it was more damaged than she said even after she sent it she told me there was additional yellowing she forgot to mention on the sales post
sorry stuck on mobile so meta has a 1111 coupon that will work all day on the 11th jst will it work on the grimoire mto they dont say when on the 11th the sale will end and the coupon doesnt seem to mention anything in exclusions website is chugging for me though i wonder if itll just be worse tomorrow
  by sale i mean the mto sorry coupon actually has very clear times
  it should be ok the announcement text says   you can use the coupon or get the metamorphose points also for the new release items  which includes the mto for romantic kimono so i dont see why it wouldnt apply to this mto as well additionally when you review your order you can see whether or not the coupon was applied to your total hth
  put inside out in a lingerie bag and wash on cold gentle then hang dry mine is from 2013 and has a little flocking wearing away but it came to me that way from the original owner
what do people mean when they say something is a feeler sale
  it usually means they want to see how much people will offer for the item but that theyre not committed to selling it unless they get an offer that makes them want to part with it    i think they were eventually banned back on lj because it was so wishywashy its much better to just set a price youre happy with or dont sell it at all instead of having people compete until the price is right so to speak an auction with a reserve would even be more suitable
  oh didnt notice that true so it should work thanks    in other things though ugh their website is dying so hard or is it just me ive been trying for half an hour to get these damn hairclips from grimoire in my cart the crash page says to email their english help if its urgent if i cant get the order through in the next hour i have work soon agh do you think theyd take an order through email
  yes or sometimes someone wants to see if theres demand for an item before taking the time to make a detailed lm listing with pics eg people posting a feeler within a local comm using only a stock pic of a dress they own and going to the trouble to take more if somebodys interested
  big bobs
best place to get a really poofy petticoat  if anyone had links they could share id be eternally grateful
  seconding this i need max poof for science reasons
    im a big fan of the petticoats by aurora and ariel     i have this one for cupcakestyle poof it should be available in white and black but it looks like white is out of stock at the moment    
  i heard melikestea is really good
  one of my comm members got a melikestea one and its massive
i want to get something on ya but the seller is no gajin buyers so buyee wont buy it are there any ss that is willing to buy from these sellers
  one day in paradise via lolita collective makes a huge cupcake petticoat im currently experimenting with
  
do you guys wear lolita in public or is it more of a convention thing im the type of person who likes to stand out but gets insecure when people make weird faces at me
  public sure you can wear it to conventions and thats where a ton of the more over the top takes on the style show up but wearing it just going about your day is perfectly reasonable
  many people wear it regularly and theres a lot of factors involved in how tolerable it can be if youre in a large metropolitan area for example people care less about what youre wearing and gothic/classic is often perceived as less weird than sweet but in terms of not liking stares and attention well you just have to get used to it and grow thick skin because people are just going to notice you practice going out with friends in public and have answers prepared for questions people might ask in public spaces where im trying to mind my own business i like to wear sunglasses and just walk very purposefully and not make eye contact also since i used to work on a street with lots of street kids who heckle pretty much everyone     on a personal level i feel like wearing in lolita helps with my anxiety because i know people are looking at me because of my clothes and i get anxious if im not in lolita and still feel like people are giving me weird looks which isobviously most the time all in my head but what can ya do and sometimes you do meet nice people who will be very kind about it and compliment you like people you would never expect so it can be nice in that way
  i wear it out in public whether its to go out on dates or running errands im a super spergy socially awkward lonelita so i understand the feeling you get when people give you weird looks but honestly youll become used to it after a while
  i wear it out in public im a lonelita but ive always been really different stylewise it does take a while to get used to all the stupid attention but eventually you just stop caring and im super introverted and used to be super shy so if i can do it anyone can
  ive had good results hand washing mine with soak detergent      i wear lolita in public pretty often i wore it to a con once but i dont get to go very often to cons     people do make weird faces but that starts to matter a lot less when you start getting comfortable in the fashion    if it helps you can use going out in public in lolita as a motivator to work towards being less insecure when people stare   i had some bad social anxiety a while back but wanting to be comfortable in lolita in public made me want to work to be more comfortable in general now i wear it pretty often even when i get weird looks   maybe itll work out like that for you too
i recently found what appears to be a second hand lolita store on taobao and was wondering if anyone has personally bought from them or can verify that they are legit and not selling replicas the price for a mademoiselle de paris special set sounds about right but for all i know it could be overpriced garbage    
  fromjapan usually will chibitenshi definitely will
  i havent been to a con since 2014 it can be a comfortable place to wear your first coord if youre nervous since youre not going to stand out so much but nowadays i mostly wear lolita to visit museums and galleries or just go out with friends

does anyone have the link to the jfash bangs google doc/power point i really need to save it its so useful
  here you go 
i keep seeing people getting beautiful velvet tartan and gothic pieces on mail threads and i have no idea where or how they manage to get them tell me your secrets gulls because closet child and wunderwelt keep letting me down and i hate dealing with lm    also where is a good place for gothic headdresses i already know antique beast but is there anywhere else
  ah you were so fast anon thank you so much
  mercari fril yja tokyoalice    all my best headdresses were either antique beast or lucky auction finds
  thank you
  the wunderwelt original petti is very poofy i have one and it doesnt even fit under several of my dresses
is there a specific name for this style its kind of earthy kind of a more toneddown otome id love to try and find more of it and not on wish
  looks a bit like the stuff earth music  ecology sell or even some western brands like fat face i dont think theres a specific style name
where do you gulls get your lacey gloves i am kind of hesitent to buy brand because my hands are pretty large i am semitall 172 cm and my fingers are long am i just fucked and shouldnt bother with gloves or are there some custom taobao sellers or just ones that carry larger sizes
    i dont know if it was just the one i got but i really hated my petticoat from them it was too short and the material was scratchy it /was/ pretty poofy though
  perhaps you picked a material thats too hard/didnt measure your required length before ordering i have one from melikestea and its soft super poofy and just the right length    i had to specify my material length and poofiness when ordering of course it wasnt the defaults    pic related is my 50cm poof monster
  under a dress
  get some nice vintage ones they come in western sizes and are usually just as nice as brand ones
  how does this hold up against heavy fabrics    i have a mlt in hard tulle and it deflated eventually cant decide if i want another and if so what fabric the hard tulle used to be huge but now its sad    what do you think about it is it good for heavy velveteen and thick cotton or just chiffon
  seconding the comment also i would consider wristcuffs instead a lot less worrying about tearing shit and chances are you dont have tree trunks for wrists so the elastic will accomodate
  cutie creator/sweet dreamer or lace crochet ones from amazon
    i did specify length and it came out shorter than requested i didnt realize we had to specify material though yours looks much much nicer than what i got for sure
  id suggest organza has the best balance i got a voile one with a lot of layers and although its heavy its still not that pooch because voile doesnt have that much natural structure it might be better if you get those ruffles between layers but she forgot to put them on mine    i have one tulle petti not mlt and only really use it as an extra layer for alines over my normal petti since it holds it shape without getting squished down at the edges      you could try western brands that do stuff for weddings like dents i like buying vintage gloves since i have small hands but it might not be good for you women in the past were smaller so theyre not usually large
  ive had good luck finding nice crochet and lace gloves at places and websites that supply gear for victorian and civil war reenactors i wear gothic though and finding black gloves is easier than finding colors
i got a new jsk today with the max bust of 91 i fit bust 88 blouses just comfortably id say i measure about a 86 bust the jsk is thin cotton and i fill out the bodice without any strain but its a snug fit the problem is every button ruffle detail on the blouse shows up under the jsk is this because of the fit and i should get jsks with a baggy fit or is it because of the fabric and its to be expected am i making an unnecessarily big deal out of this
  i should add its fairly see through when i completely unzip it too but other worn pic ive seen of it with a blouse under it looked alright
hey gulls it there any chance someone who could link me to the lolibrary page for this dress i would do it myself but for some reason the websites currently not working for me i need measurements    pretty please
  also the dress is btssb
  its not working for anyone noob
      not lolibrary but another listing of the same dress with measurements in the desc
  seriously its not working for anyone ask the seller for measurements
  noob  nah just only lurk v specific threads  i kinda figured no one else was able to access it either but the fb page dint say anything so i had hoped i was just unlucky what exactly is going on has it been discussed on the board yet
  i would but ww is selling it i tried to message them once for a sales post but when 2 weeks passed i just caved and bought anyways i dont really want a repeat of that
  holy shit thank you so much
  with pieces like that i usually wear a blouse that doesnt have buttons or a ton of details
    could be either desu if you care to post the dress maybe someone who owns it can tell you more    ive owned some very thin dresses that would show every bump underneath but also some very thin dresses that dont  for some reason ap and meta are much better with not showing bumps im not sure if they just use a better lining for their thin poly dresses or what     and then theres iw which boobloafs in every direction and will show you boob pancakes along with buttons bumps and bodice strain even though max bust and waist is like 5cm above my bust    also could equally be your buttons are too big a lot of my blouses even ap with their fancy buttons have pretty flat buttons not exactly humongous knobs so even if it showed its just be some fairly flat bumps anyhow
what kind of style would you call gunifuni and tuketasis clothing
half of the styles i want to wear require pleated skirts where can i get pastel ones in fatty chan sizes
  bodyline
what laundry detergent do the girls on jp mercari wash their clothes with every time i get mail from my ss all the second hand clothes i order have that old books/bubblegum smell can i order the detergent online help it smells so good
  i asked the same thing a while ago i think the general consensus was that its dry cleaning smell rather than a detergent
those of you who have boyfriends who buy stuff for you where do they buy from do they always buy new my bfs asking me what i want for christmas and i want to recommend a secondhand site that he could get something from but i feel like sellers on lm might be put off by the fact that hes male from what i understand some secondhand shops in japan are wary about selling used womens clothing to men do you know if thats true for closetchild or wunderwelt i feel like the best option would probably be something like yjapan or fril through a shopping service but it seems like a lot to ask him to learn how to do that just to get me presents
  you dont have to display your gender on lm as far as i know and i doubt most sellers would take issue with it and i imagine men buy from closetchild all the time either as gifts or as brolitas or buying the mens clothing they have for sale there do you think theyre gonna turn down a sale and refuse to take his money
is it a bad thing if i cant raise my arms all the way up while wearing an op
  i now associate that smell with the joy of opening packages and its the most amazing thing ever man i just love lolita
  what about bigger than bodyline sizes
  if it makes you unable to function normally yes i have very wide shoulders so i cant rise my arms completely and it makes even dresses a bit baggy on me otherwise look tight i can zip them by myself though and put hair accessories on my head if you cant do those its bad
im really only familiar w/ sweet lolita fashion brands what are some good gothic lolita brands
  boz  moitie atelier pierrot antique beast
i got a real stupid question does bodyline have any sort of customer service email i have not ordered from them in awhile and never had an issues but a large order was just canceled on me and i can not figure out why i cant seem to find any sort of email or inquiry form on the site am i blind if i am thats fine ill admit this is stupid question
  did they send you any sort of email should let you know the reason for cancelling though youll likely have to translate it
  they have not which is the source of my confusion i thought i had paid properly last night but this morning relized paypal had not sent me an emial it was not in a paypal statement and bodyline had not sent me any sort of email about the order the only thing it says on the order status is cancelled   i would like to try to find out if it was an issue with paypal for it to be cancelled or an issue with bodyline itself but i cannot find anyway to contact them im also trying their fb and twitter but i do not think they are going to respond
  oooh thats happened to me when i jsut never finished making the order like if i go to pay then get distracted on paypal and forget and it logs me out then it will say cancelled so likely the payment just never went through because you didnt finish it
  going to say   is probably right same thing has happened to me when i forget about an order or go through with it to see how much paypal will charge me after converting from yen then just close out the tab without completing it if you paid then both bodyline and paypal would send you an email really just sounds like you never completed the payment so after a while the order gets cancelled because it was never finished
    thanks for the help anon theres a good chance that happened completely redoing the order is the best way to go about it right
  adding on to  also sheglit and miho matsuda though theyre a bit more plain
  omg yes love both of them
  yes seeing as how bodyline never received payment since it was not completed
  men cant raise their arms too high in suits so idk doesnt seem that big a deal
  i feel like getting a partner used to an ss is a bit much id recommend closetchild or wunderwelt lacemarket could be okay but what if he had a bad seller and didnt know what to do if it came damaged or he didnt notice the damages    idk if this is an option for you but my husband didnt want to deal with online shopping so he just lets me buy my own gifts within a price range he sets
bought pic related velveteen first velveteen dress assuming dry clean only is it safe to steam maybe from the underside of the fabric
why do sellers list the same item on fril and mercari but the mercari one is more expensive ive seen this multiple times now and im confused i want to buy an item should i buy the cheaper listing on frill or is there some weird caveat plz help
why is rainies a controversial seller on lm ive been looking at some stuff shes selling but ive heard others say you shouldnt support her
  me top left
  can u lurk more  shes a scalper
  because shes a scalper and buys things from fril/mercari just to sell on lacemarket with the price bumped considerably
  i think mercari charges more selling fee or the shipping fee is included in price
  she buys listings from various secondhand sources and resells them after inflating the price far higher than she bought it for theres also proof of her not disclosing all the damages/imperfections that were included in the original listing of the item
  ah i thought it might be more selling fees they both have shipping included
  so i purchased blessing from juno dot ivory op off of lace market it came in really good condition seemingly but once i wore it out i noticed a very faint orangey stain on the outer chiffon layer and you cant really see it unless its out in the sun should i try cleaning it myself or would it be better to take it to a try cleaner
can you combine buyee and tenso orders
  no
  pretty much     have an old thread where we discussed lm scalpers     basically what makes me mad is how there are people who would want those listings rainies buys to wear i would be so hype and it would make my day if i got something i really wanted for a really low price but no rainies and other scalpers theres a few in japan too buy all the cheap listings and try to sell you something they bought at 3000 for 120 plus international shipping
  rainies is a scalper and also just shoddy with her listings i bought three separate listings from her and only got feedback on one of them i would have appreciated an accurate record of my purchases
  should be safe to steam inside out i steam all my velveteen pieces
  i bought a dress from rainies and there were some serious undisclosed issues with the dress i found out those were perfectly stated in the original listing that she bought it from for far cheaper too she copypasted their whole description and left out the issues i got curious then and looked at some of her other listings origins and all of them without an exception were copied the same way with a price raise
this is gonna sound dumb butif youre wearing a gray jacket/short coat how do you tie it into the rest of your coord if theres no gray in your main piece youre not going to wear gray shoes or a gray bag or a gray hair accessory unless its a beret/hat is is ok if theres nothing else that colour at all    pic related not mine but similar i know its greige not true gray irl
  look for items with similar saturation if its a cool gray mix it with cool colors if a warm gray mix it with warm colors also great for monochrome coords with black and white brown generally works nice as well
  thanks i was thinking of wearing it with blues and whites so it should be harmonious
are these somewhat replicas
  oh wow i didnt know rainies was controversial desu doesnt she have like perfect feedback on lm btw since youre making accusations you should post some proof but i mean i do know were on cgl so whatever
how do i get rid of pinholes via steaming    i own ap charlottes bear op and the seller never mentioned that there are two pinholes in the tie pic related is what the tie looks like theyre not very noticeable but i want to try and get rid of them for good    my concern is would the steam damage the fabric at all or make the tiny rhinestone fall off the tie is a silkytype polyester fabric help would be much appreciated
  or just look it up yourself this is not some secret info thats hard to find
  i dont think itd damage it the fabric looks the same as on other ap pieces ive steamed without issue
  i mean yes    but also you might be me and an idiot who is determined to wear a dress even though she cant raise her arms and then gets home at 12am only to realize shes stuck in her dress because she cant reach the zipper and has to ask her roommate whos shes never spoken to to get her out
  if youre worried hold the steamer away from the fabric to gently heat the area and then work the fabric with your fingers repeat until holes are gone
      thanks anons i was even thinking of also covering the emblem part with a cloth since the holes are further up what do you think
what are your opinions on wearing clothes intended for lolita with other jfashion styles fairy kei himegyaru efc
  if you make it work aesthetically go for it all that matters is that it looks good
does anyone know if kuua oyasumi has an online shop
can you use zenmarket for ordering lucky packs from places like axes femme     if not which shopping services are the cheapest and most reliable for getting lucky packs
  its no big deal as long as it looks good for example angelic prettys dream sky looks fantastic with fairy kei
are there other sites like bodyline that ship overseas i know how to use freight forwarders but im trying to ems a quick order before next week

i dont have a lot of money and all my other wigs are shitty bodyline im looking at getting a nice one i wear sweetclassic think allover lace or chiffon dresses from baby and aatp and gothic    would gyaru wigs be cute i am hesitant to get a basic wig when i could just use my own hair and they look a little questionable my skin tone is light olive i am hispanic but not dark skinned
does anyone know the name of this dress
  bunnys herbology by yolanda
has anyone gotten atelier bozs holiday special sets in the past is the quality up there with their regular releases really tempted by their current one all the pieces are something i really like individually unlike last years but i think ive been conditioned by sweet brands to think that cheaper special set  cheaper materials and lower quality i could see with bozs stuff being a simpler design that they might be perfectly normal quality its still 50000 after all and at that price tag i want it to be good stuff    google translate is confusing me a bit based on that bust size for the jacket im going to want the l size of the set but google is bungling it up with the l size of the ladies mini skirt  short pants set will only be handed for 2 periods but im guessing it just means you can order it now but l size will only be delivered during the later janfeb period
  why do you want a wig is your natural hair hard to put up or style a wig isnt a lolita necessity and if you can manage to do french braids you can probably manage a lot of lolita appropriate hairstyles
  i was looking at the boz special set too but to be honest their regularly priced items arent that bad you can get most items for under/around 20000 yen so i actually dont think youll be saving much by getting a set i do think its a nice set though and the items seem very versatile
  my natural hair is frizzy and unpleasant i can curl it but it will quickly tangle no matter what conditioner and leave in i can do braided styles but that gets old and isnt always fancy enough for the sweetclassic dresses i have unless i put a lot of work into it i love wigs because they have that thin slippery texture the exact opposite of my hair
how do you make a shapeless dress like pic related look good
  have negative tiddy keep the petticoat reasonably small pick a top that flatters your décolletage cover your shoulders and chest with something that works for your body have belowzero tiddy

  if you could recognize any of these i would appreciate it very much
how do you guys find out and keep up with when international lolita days actually are
  i found them all except for the bottom left one            
whats the best way to clean a headbow with wire in it  ive heard they risk rusting if exposed to water
  its always the first saturday in june and the first saturday in december
  oh ok easy enough    thanks anon
  damp cloth with a very mild detergent dab what you need clean
are there any websites where i can look up coords by type of items used ie coords with cutsews skirts etc
  its impossible
does anyone know where to get these bloomers been looking for a pair and i really like these but i definitely dont like nor want to support stupid resellers especially when they are likely not worth almost 40 bucks
are these tights too similar to the holy lantern ones or possibly ripping off something else i bought them off ebay without realizing the similarities
  baby has released very similar looking bloomers theirs look even cuter than this actually they pop up secondhand sometimes i suggest you look through the japanese market for this
  nah theyre just a random taobao design to my knowledge not based on anything be sure to handwash them i made the mistake of machine washing mine and theyve lost their sparkle
  i believe they are from yidhra on taobao there are a lot of resellers i liked the ones i got just wish i could find the original store
  thanks but i have seen a couple people wearing these exact ones and was curious if anyone knew where they were from considering this reseller has them im sure i can find them for15 bucks or so not 30shipping and was wondering if anyone had any clue
  what reseller are you talking about do you mean closet child
  cherry_sp on lm
  did you already get them and are they nice if so could i have the ebay link please
i know this is a stupid question because there is a measurement on lolibrary but    vms sailor doll skirt is on mercari and ive kind of always wanted it but the mercari listing says its 61cm waist and lolibrary says 64cm waist im 65cm waist is it really that small im guessing theres no chance id fit it im just in denial right now probably since ive always liked it but never realized i wont fit it
    thanks gulls good to know    unfortunately they have yet to arrive heres the link though  
  gyaru styled wigs might be a bit out of style but i think it works fine if you primarily wear sweet because giant head bows
  youre not gonna fit friendo also remember that you need space for tights to tuck in your blouse etc
i heard that the famous star clip pins origin from 6dokidoki so if i buy them anywhere else are they considered as a design replica is it socially acceptable
  i think its generally considered a generic design so from a legal standpoint its fine not a replica in addition to that many people dont actually know that these star clips were originally designed by 6 so theres no stigma on them like there is on print replicas
  no one gives a fuck
  yes its still a design replica but they look shoehorned in almost every coord ive seen with them so its better to just not buy at all
im trying to get rid of my normie clothing for my jfashion  are there any good sites to get rid of this shit i know of depop already
  yeah thanks for helping me confirm reality anon i guess deep down inside i was hoping someone would comment like oh i have that and its bigger than the measurements say and anecdotally i have a jetj skirt that is waaaay bigger than its measurements on lolibrary but i just need to accept this and hunt down the op thanks again anon
  is there another second hand jp service that will order from mericarijp  ive tried from jp japonia and zen and they wont order from them for some reason
  ebay desu your best bet is depop or like some kind of store in your city that buys clothing like buffaloexchange though to be fair youre not going to get a lot for normie clothes
are there any lolita conventions or mass gatherings left in the us
  try out poshmark
  paradiso
  thank you
  where is this beret from
which ss is the coke account on mercari
does anyone have examples for a dress and headwear in the same print but different colourways being used together in a coord
  i do this all the time and i think other people do too check cof or google for pastel vomit prints like jewelry jelly decoration dream milky planet etc and you should find some mixed colorway coords
  
repeating the question here since it went unnoticed in the wig thread what are decent wig sources for people with big heads 60cm  someone can look into
  arda has large sizes
im interested in getting into nanchatte for more casual jfash do box pleats exist in the fashion or are they not really the look i usually only see knife pleats but i kind of prefer box pleated skirts just wondering if its a nono
is this a good time to sell lolita pieces or is everyone saving up for the holidays
  well it is black friday so maybe
  i dont mean today specifically i havent even taken photos yet
can anyone tell me what the stock now button means i want to buy some socks but ive never bought straight from angelic pretty before   help
  it is in stores stock only you can buy it but its cod so tenso wont work
  since they mostly cater to cosplayers and dont have many natural colors it didnt really come to my mind to give them a try which models are recommendable for lolita usage mainly interested in a dark brown one
stupid question if a seller has paypal fees included in the price are they violating lms terms of use or does this rule only apply for when a seller tries to charge pp fees separately in the invoice on top of the listing price
hey gulls i have a question i ordered something from aliexpress to be shipped to canada but for some reason its in vienna the destination still seems to be canada but is this a common thing do parcels have pitstops i might be paranoid over nothing
  parcels do have pit stops ive had packages go through various countries before reaching mine so its normal
  isnt canada still having mail issues
  thank you so much somehow ive never had a parcel do this so i was a bit thrown off     yes but the parcel isnt in canada yet we can still send/receive mail its just slow af
  yes thats allowed
  pls respond
im used to buying secondhand from japanese sites like wunderwelt and closetchild using fromjapan as ss how more difficult is buying from mercari and fril are there some guides out there id like to give them a try but im a little worried im not very good with internet stuff 
  why do you use shopping services for wunderwelt
  using a shopping service is cheaper than buying directly for my country i live in europe
ive been watching a dress on yahoo auctions recently and the price went up to 300400usd however once the auction ended it was relisted again despite having 16 bids the price is back at the beginning price of 30 what does this mean
  use google translate it didnt reach the minimum bid the seller wanted which is an optional feature for auctions
    either that or the seller canceled it even with bids they can do that
  nah it didnt reach the minimum bid if the seller has that feature on it says so in the bidding box    tfw i know which auction anon was talking about because i was the one who bid it up to 400 usd
so never had ipl hair removal before but when you do it i know you need multiple sessions but when you get a session done does the hair fall out after doing it how long does the affected hairs from ipl take ti come out
how much is local shipping for mercari and frill items is it included in the price displayed    is buying from fril and mercari safe i mean they are private sellers right is there something i should check to know whether they are reliable
    domestic shipping varies from person to person cause some will include it for me it was usually around 500 yen be wary of items that have been listed for awhile or dont have proof photos i got scammed once because my ss was out of town the way mercari works the seller gets the money once the buyer is satisfied its apparently considered rude to withhold money from the buyer even if you didnt receive the item yet which is dumb but okay the seller had a few bad reviews about not receiving items but my ss and i overlooked them cause they had more positive reviews also keep in mind that replicas do get sold and passed off as original so dont be afraid to ask for proof photos and be suspicious of old items that are being described as new i was excited to buy some new popular liz lisa items that were discontinued but they turned out to chinese knock offs but overall ive enjoyed buying off mercari/fril
  not sure how this is related to jfash but the part of the hair thats on the outside of your skin gets burnt off basically thats why you need to shave really clean before getting it otherwise it wont be able to get to the deeper parts and it usually takes a day or two longer to grow back than it would after just shaving although it really depends on the person
  thank you
this isnt strictly jfashion but are there any chinesespeaking anons here i want to buy this shirt because it looks cool but what does it read i ran it through newocr and got lengjing from the first two characters which means quiet according to google translate but its not picking up the last character  i just dont want to be that dumbass who could be walking around with big cocks printed on their front in another language unbeknownst to them
  thats japanese
  it means into calmness
has anybody else not gotten their lacemarket saved search alerts the past few days not sure whats going on but ive gotten zero and i have so many saved searches that i get a couple dozen alerts per day so it isnt that people havent been listing
  i havent been to a con since 2015 and even back when i went more frequently i usually saved my con days for cosplaying i dont wear lolita super often due to my work i havent been getting out much recently but when i do its either for a comm meet parties special events at my uni or just for fun while im out in town
i fucking suck at coording lolita and yet ive been wearing the fashion for 4 years nothing truly ita just everything i put together is so plain compared to what the fashion is capable of     is there any hope for me not being the most boring dresser in my comm
    seconding paradiso i recommend making friends with people who typically organize stuff though because a handful of them are also planning some interesting bigger events next year
just made my first purchase on aliexpress and i was wondering what is this processing time and why would i want to extend it
  do something abnormal or risky dont follow trends wear some unique indie or even handmade pieces
ive never sold my own creations before but is it acceptable to sell an accessory that i used some hot glue to make obviously im not going to charge out the ass and im trying to use hot glue as sparingly as possible just to put clips on the back and embed small things like beads and in a way where its not visible i just dont want to feel like im wasting my time hand sewing fake flowers on to a headdress
  also adding the stuff is mostly sewn just hot glue where its the most logical option
i am struggling to find lolita knee highs lace up boots can someone point me in the right direction
which shopping services can go in person for you to a store in tokyo other than tenshi looking for options
anywhere to buy pure white lacetopped socks right now i know metamorphose has lace socks in stock but it seems like both white options are offwhite
im doing a mercari order is 2395 yen normal for fees it seems like most of it is paypal fees and thats not including the commission fees for the items themselves
does anyone know the processing time for lolitawardrobe ive looked through their faq but they only talk about shipping time
  can take up to a week and a bit 7 business days also make sure that nothing in your order was a preorder because they will only ship the rest of the items when the preorder item is released
  nice thanks for the response anon
thread for cosplay ideas/ techniques that have been stolen or not given proper credit
  original sailor melanin posted months ago
this so much  also theres been hella people on my timeline clearly stealing hee hees wig styling method of flipping the wig upside down and steaming it and not giving credit
  thats a styling technique not stealing a unique idea flipping upside down is a very common way to fluff up wigs and i really doubt hee hee would claim its stolen
      nothing about this reeks of stolen idea to me sailor moon pattern swapout are an insanely common idea as is racebending popular characters and the executions are totally different    hell i was one of three people who ran into each other at dragoncon this year all dressed as sailor mariott with the carpet print and we each thought we were the first one to think of it
  thats been a styling method for as long as synthetic wigs have been a thing this is why 99 percent of stole my idea crying is bullshit
this is such an obvious selfpost i feel so much cringe
  this  no one cares about your special sailor moon variants its always sailor moon
  thats adorable and i love you
lol unless youre literally mass producing exact copies of a cosplay to sell for megabux there is no such thing as cosplay idea theft
  i absolutely love how that carpet is a meme i have never been before but man for sure id make something based off it if i did go maybe like a king of all cosmos or something
    this hell i do it too and i didnt know about hee hee      i love it
  its possible to steal an obviously original design like how momokun operates but ops post is just about a concept its only a problem if someone wholesale copies a cosplay or art design and then refuses to credit
  i agree there is no cosplay theft only homage that the cosplayer should be grateful for too many cosplayers give the bad attitude when really he should be happy to see it and receive more exposure
  thats like saying everyone thats used worbla stole it from kamui because she helped popularize it
lets have an ez cosplay thread for people with little to no sewing skills and wig styling at absolute minimum ill start with some can be bought from a thrift tier characters sans the prop in some cases
so simple that i feel a bit guilty im actually thinking weaving every fabric by myself to make it a challenge
did this one last year with stuff off aliexpress it took me about 30 minutes to sew blue ribbon on the skirt and an hour and a half to style the wig i had a summer con and no heat friendly costumes and id bought the wig for another cos but the color wasnt right so it worked out perfectly for me plus its nice when a costume includes a backpack and comfy shoes
  i actually just finished this one and desu the poncho can be a challenge even if youre going the lazy route
a ton of danganronpa cosplays can be done by just putting together shit from thrift stores aoi makoto leon kyoko byakuya chihiro hinata akane mahiru fuyuhiko rantaro himiko angie off the top of my head there could be more even junko could be pretty easily thrown together if you find the right stuff
  this    i did saihara with very little knowledge by buying an oversized striped suit and folding one side over the other    it worked somewhat alright
  some of these could definitely work like aoi or hinata with some minor modifications though im assuming thats fine but some are definitely too complicated or specific to thrift like chihiro
btb is dead long live btb edition    rrurrrus   block out names   dont fixate forever on one person so we dont get fukken nuked mods  gods   sfw this is a blue board you sluts
  ew wtf is that  t newish fag
  thank you for this thread op bless
  theyre fucking tea parties they are a staple
  anon they look like they need to be stapled
  seconding   those things are at the edge of being functional anymore wearing them to a public event where youre going to be seen by other lolitas was a mistake    i dont have a photo but heres my confession  im a giant bitchy salt mine in private with my personal lolita friends but act reasonably cordial and supportive with my comm   not actively trashing my comm/vendettas just willing to completely tear an outfit apart for fun   multiple babby lolitas in comm have tried friend requesting me out of the blue   i am not the mentor youre looking for
  lol i watched this thread and i was thinking that girl probably has mildew in her closets or something
  where was it posted
  is this old or new what region i dont want her near my brando she might think im too rich
  the original was in a regional comm where people were i think rightfully offended that she claimed the city was making her clothes stink unless she sat in pee on the bus or something its a pretty weird claim
  what are plus size sections
  the original post was her steaming about skinny women shopping in the plus size or large sections in thrift shops  she specifically used the phrase taking up space which is hilarious to me because bitch theyre thin they cant be taking up that much space    us but shes a lonelita again so it doesnt matter
  arizona
  haha oh shit  i didnt notice due to poor photo quality   yeah thats pretty bad actually
  shes a lonelita again  did her comm finally ditch her last time i heard they were mostly defending her shoplifting
  looks like a man
  it was from the sf comm  it was an odd post from the start and i already knew what kind of shit show it was about to ensure
  meant to put ensue at the end
  im dying this is the same girl
  she posted this yesterday so were doing something right
  simple question
  she is i dont think anyone has talked to her about it but people know
  ot but this makes so much sense whether you like this person or not i get so tired of seeing people being like i hate the lolita community so i am going to stop wearing all my clothes forever likeno justdont interact with other lolitas
  i would be surprised if the entirety of her com doesnt know by now she tried to slag the buyer off in her insta and changed her lace market description to say that shed been blacklisted everywhere and that her feedback should be negative shes just drawing so much attention to her own shitty actions idg how shes still the mod of the sales com
  whats wrong with this question
    she or someone using her name it was a newly made account called her out on r/lolita about it
  i think it is due to the whole inserting of the city name and being way blunt on what they think the smells are compare to saying since moving to the city ive started to notice my clothes have picked up strange smells and im wondering the best way to keep my stuff smelling fresher longer without putting to much stress on my stuff  the way the op put it basically saying this city is disgusting and i smell piss and shit on the streets and now my clothes smell like when im away from it
  the way the op put it basically saying this city is disgusting and i smell piss and shit on the streets and now my clothes smell like when im away from it    well but what if that is true why shouldnt she tell that
  it was from the sf comm the whole thing was an elaborate way for her to humblebrag that she just moved to nob hill a wealthy area that might have been trendy in the 90s but is now just full of old people
  she can say what she wants but people can and will take offense to their city being perceived that way by someone who hasnt lived there before casts negativity on the city that is most likely unwarranted
  the thing is its not true sf has grosser areas but unless this bitch is actually sitting in piss somewhere the smells arent going to cling this girl decided that one of her first interactions with her new comm would be to tell them their city makes her burando smell bad and is now crying because she didnt make any friends by it she deserves 100 of the dragging shes getting learn some social skills bitch     im 1000 miles from sf but jfc man
  wanna share a more you know moment ive recently come across so apparently pleather and leather have the relatively same carbon foot print if you go brand by brand they then can be much better or much worse on either end basically it comes down to this leather has the issue of animal suffering attached to it and pleather once produced never biodegrades and so perminately adds to the plastic in landfills also leather can be made safely but most producers choose cheaper methods which are more harmful to the leather workers handling the materials meanwhile pleather produces offgasses that pollute the air around the factory    so next time a vegan rants about the evils of leather in broad general terms remind them that its a muddy grey zone where neither category of materials is inherently better  sorry about that but im tried of girls at meets bragging about their super ethical lolita accessories      good and good
  you forgot that you need to replace pleather bags more often and leather is a byproduct from the meat industry youre not helping the cows by not buying it theyll still die since world meat consumption is increasing over time
    these are facts consider her vegan pussy canceled sis
  if an attentionwhore shits in the woods without getting validation from other lolitas does it make a sound
  wait is she saying moitie uses fur
    i hate the whole concept of this shit ive had people defend it to no end and i cant help but laugh at people criticizing cosplayers spending habits and then flipping shit just because its brandand wasting 800 on a cosplay dress i love you aatp but man people are stupid
  no person who buys this is going to make it look good fax
  im out of the loop so i dont know whats up with this dress but it doesnt look horrible or anything to me i actually like it apart from the decorations on the bodice which kind of look tacky
  its a princess serenity dress the details on the bodice are meant to look like her dress
  i have a confession to make about this dress thank you for posting it    i secretly love that aatp only made this dress in one size i saw the dress posted on tumblr and went through the tags and comments and it was dozens of planets complaining i need this1 but its never gonna fit me a bloobloo i smiled every time i saw another fattie cry about never having it i smiled every time i saw a poor fattie whine about the price and size i love having dresses that only fit thinner people i want something sacred just for me something i can be proud to have and flaunt just a little because i worked hard for it aatp is my favourite designer brand and i love what it means to have pieces from them
  honestly it looks like you dont even have to be that thin to fit this dress so imagine how fat those posters are
    im totally a lolita and also a girl u guise
  then dont buy neither
    this sounds familiar
  i cannot wait to see the shitty coords that come from buying this overpriced piece though ngl     i respect some degree of nostalgiafaggotry but honestly i know too many people buying into this shit and going broke 90 of collabs to revive some old anime or movies looking at you disney look like shit and pander to a crowd that seeks to just set their wallets on fire not considering you could have just commissioned this dress for a fraction of the price if you wanted to cosplay so badly
  amen to that owning brand also helps me prevent becoming a fattychan the day i dont fit into my brand shit is the day ill kms     and i feel that too i love my fat friends but at the same time i was the person bullied for being too thin and so its a very pretty middle finger to display in this culture that glorifies obesity let skinny bitches enjoy things stop making them share their cake with fatfucks who clearly dont need anymore
  ayrt  i feel the same about my fat friends and i enjoy empowering them to love themselves by telling them i like how they look because i do i feel like my thoughts on fatties change because in the tumblr situation you have a person condemning or crying over a thing because of their size and in my situation my fat friends respect me the same way i respect them we dont cry about clothing sizes especially not here in north america where there are stores that cater solely to fat people i think there are cute things in those stores but i dont whine about not fitting so why should i put up with whining about smaller clothes   i used to be too lardy for brand and now i keep myself thin enough for most brand pieces cant help my height it boggles the mind to hear an obese person go on about how hard it is to lose weight and how brand should cater to their bad eating habits no jan put the fork in a salad more often and then whine to me about how hard your life is id love more brand for tallies like me but i am not average so ill hold my tongue
  typical gull this isnt a confession youre common around here
i saved this a while back and think about it wistfully from time to time    please santa
  freal though
  lolling at the serendipity of this woman living in a place called nob hill
    oh im not skinny but i bought the dress in  its half shirred so my guess is all those fatties you see stuffing themselves into halfshirred ap would probably also try to fit into this and thats not covering hamplanets who try to squeeze into everything anyway    the ones crying abloobloo never gonna fit are probably covering that theyre poorfags or were just never gonna spend money anyway i dont think they actually care whether or not they fit they just needed an excuse to whine that theyre not buying it    no comment on the cosplayers thing though i buy a lot of disney collabs and disney stuff from secret honey so its not like i have a lot of room to criticise when im dropping 20k yen on all of the cosplay dresses
  girls who live in sf got butt hurt because they spend thousands of dollars a month to live in a literal shit hole
    i have taken public transport in chicago in lolita and lets be real its dirty af and i have never encountered this issue bitch is lying about why her clothes smell like piss and shit
   the only time my clothes ever smelled like that while in sf was i got roped into helping a disabled homeless person to a public bathroom they didnt have a cane or anything and had a bad limp so i helped them to a building that had a restroom on the first floor by the front door their smell lingered on me but jesus one wash and it was gone unless she is rubbing or touching things on the street that smell doesnt end up on you for no reason
  my shoes stink for a few days after getting home from the city not normally my clothes but they go straight to the wash my carr however thats another story its always gross for a while after a visit
    its funny because i saw a non stock photo of this and it looked awful the promo photos make it look so much better than it really does
  yeah i sympathize more with tall lolitas struggling over dress lengths being too short on them more so than fat people crying that they cant fit brand a lot of brand has been catering to fatter people so i agree with you its not discrimination to make clothes for a certain demographic its a pointless argument  even while japanese consider lolita a fat girl fashion their perception of fat is much different from a westerners but we can more or less agree that once xs or sizes start going into american 15 territory  youre not thicc or big boned  youre fat and not every brand will cater to you
  really i was told this dress was available as a mto that was in the 800 territory was that a lie then hahahah
i dont have an image but consider this an open letter to someone im getting tired of     please stfu about all your illnesses and how your husband buys so much lolita for you yet your closet is almost entirely bodyline theres nothing bragworthy about having a wardrobe full of walmart you literally make every conversation about yourself and its exhausting maybe youre autistic but theres no way youre in your 30s and still dont understand socially acceptable interactions
  can you read they were talking about the secret honey dresses the secret honey collabs are 20000 yen
  thank you im gonna remember this next time my vegetarian friend comes whining to me  i once got shit for wearing wool instead of polyester wtf
  cows going to be eaten dont usually pass for leather use sadly i wish they would because i dont mind a scar from a bug bite on my shoes but i dont want to support the leather producing this is a really hard question
    this     the sailormoon dress is 7080k yen    its the secret honey collab dresses that usually run around 20k yen these arent even accurate cosplay dresses theyre just disneythemed casual dresses     the actual cosplay dresses from secret honey generally run closer to 4080k yen pic related is 60k yen theres a belle ballgown dress and some of the other gowns ran closer to 100k yen including a few of the accurate wedding dresses idk cosplayers are free to spend what they want i guess i generally buy secret honey because its easy i know what quality to expect rather than buying from some unknown chinese shop and barring the fixedsize onepieces most pieces do fit me    for what its worth i only bought the sailormoon dress after a friend saw it in person at la foret and wouldnt shut up about how pretty it was and how she wished there wasnt any glass around it so she could get a closer look at the underlayer with the gold  print idk im just hoping it fits over my boobs okay and i dont have to tailor the top
i hate poorfags i guess    the constant complaining about the cost of lolita and i guess even cosplay is all half the community talks about    its hard to have any meaningful discussion or make friends with similar interests when it all gets flooded out by people who dont own a full coordinate because their budget or sizes or culture doesnt allow it i mean why are you even in a lolita group if your only input is why you cant wear lolita    if you actually do your research and have patience you can find good deals and get nice dresses for 2000 yen maybe not the specific print or colorway you were hoping for but you can at least wear the god damn fashion or resell it to another moron like yourself and get the one you actually want     its strange to me that most high fashion communities i have seen arent also this way crying about how a dolce  gabbana shirt is 500 and the dress they want is 2000 the cost of lolita is a joke in comparison and yet we are overrun by incompetent people with no jobs or work ethic to afford the fashion let alone the taste and appreciation for quality to assemble something that the public at large wouldnt scoff at     the absence of precious burando has forced some people to incorporate pieces from their normal wardrobe which if they had good taste would be an interesting experimentation that could even start a new trend but instead we almost inevitably end up with itas and if the coord was different in a good way the volume of people with poor judgement would result in a majority vote of this is not loli or some such nonsense the community is more often than not embarrassing to be a part of
  i technically count as a poor fag i think the issue is that the complainers are used to forever 21 and aliexpress they dont understand why clothes that are not mass produced and are catered for a niche would be expensive and refuse to understand a lot of these people dont even like lolita for the fashion itself they use it as a way to be that kawaii girl they saw on instagram or to be a part of a community that makes them feel like a unique snowflake the price of lolita and sizing prevents them from living their fantasy because they think they are entitled to it despite usually having bad spending habbits and being fat as fuck
god i fucking hate scalpers those ww lots could have gone to a newbie someone with a small wardrobe or someone whod be really happy about it not to your greedy fat ass i am so very close to boycotting these kind of sellers to make them fuck off
  i boycot them honestly lets start a boycott
  and the source for your data is what i work with leather pretty often and have met several tannery owners cowhides tend to be in excess of 50 sq feet and patterns are placed around any scars except for a few designers who like to include them the leather called box calf which i refuse to work with comes from the same cows used to make veal its not very economically feasible to waste 2000 lbs of cow for every 50 sq feet of leather
  honestly rainies gets a lot of cute stuff and ill be tempted for a second before i notice who is selling them then it doesnt matter what it is or what the price is i refuse to even think about buying it same for the other scalpers it just seems that rainies buys up stuff thats my aesthetic
  this is me but i dont mind offering advice as well i just have a harsher opinion of it to my closest friends in private but if someones willing to improve ill find a nice way of giving concrit to their faces
  fuck i feel this cherry sp has a pair of socks that ive been looking for forever and its really hard im bitter bc i need those socks but theyre overpriced and its a fucking scalper
  is rainies really a scalper her prices dont seem that high to me but im a newbie so maybe im wrong
  yeah i know she scalps but her prices are no different then other sellers and she has good feedback
  that is a completely valid option i was just talking about people whove developed a superiority complex over buying veganfriendly options out of ego instead of a genuine interest in what they preach      again polyester isnt automatically better then wool id argue its an even more ambiguous material because sheep can often have a very good quality of life depending on the farm      agreed the moral / ethical questions around clothing and fashion accessory material is not simple if all leather came exclusively from meat industry byproduct that would instead change the dynamics and wed have to reassess it all over again      thank you for those numbers im gonna keep them in mind as a general reference
   i use to really avoid scalpers but what always gets me is that ive been literally lied to / scammed by several reasonablypriced deals and yet everytime ive bought from the scalpers ive paid too much but have gotten exactly what i wanted it really messes with you i dont want to support their pricing but they technically treat me better as a customer then a lot of more fairprice sellers
  theres proof of her not disclosing all the imperfections
    yes she sells scalped items from mercari  yahoo and frill literally how she received them one time she sold a dress with really yellowed lace and wrote that it looks natural she often doesnt mention missing parts and stains  here are the past threads about her and other scalpers/resellers     there are also some secrets about them but i cant find them rn
  this every time ive been scammed by someone it was always from the fair priced sellers on my local sales page they then get extremely defensive when you tell them the issues
  i have a list i use full of sellers i wont buy from i hate people who do this i wish other people wouldnt as well because someone is supporting their stupid business
  wait is the ss muuh the same person as rainies
  no muuh ss is a shopping service she bought it for rainies
  i refuse to buy from anybody i know to be a scalper or if i suspect they are i would absolutely join a boycott because it genuinely makes my blood boil especially with the cheap wunderwelt lots if i bought one it would be for my own wardrobe and id rather people who are just passionate about lolita and not about making a profit have all those pieces to enjoy for themselves
lolita amino posted their version of behind the bows earlier something about the vermont comm
  basically this 
wow you werent kidding about the mods op anyone else notice a handful of innocuous posts missing
  poor fag here i used to have a job but i was injured earlier this year that prevents me from doing any work but i still manage to get nice shit    even before i became poor fag i would never purchase anything over 100 i dont understand people who whinge that they cant afford burando when my whole wardrobe bar some bodyline and taobao blouses is secondhand brand its not that fucking hard or expensive i think they either have no idea where to shop or want things that they cant afford i have cheap brand stuff for sale on lm and while its not holy fucking lantern its not ugly     i guess my point is i am a poor fag who uses that to my advantage and those who dont are just plain fucking stupid     tldr i agree with you
confession because its been tearing me apart     my life has really gone down the toilet the last few years and as a result i havent really worn lolita in what feels like forever     multiple members of my immediate and extended family have either died or been diagnosed with latestage terminal illnesses two of them right around the time i started my first real job which was far away and stressful enough on its own i couldnt handle everything and had a bit of a breakdown quit and moved home to my family who are mostly poor in the months after i got home i spent what little savings i had and even had to sell most of my valuables including 90 of my lolita wardrobe     i havent been able to get a single decent paying job since then even though ive tried in 3 different cities job hunting has left me feeling like a worthless idiot and every job i do get slowly eats away at me until i physically or mentally cant take it anymore i wouldnt be able to afford to live if it werent for the fact that my boyfriend makes decent money and pays for our apartment no matter how much i try to cut back it never seems to make a difference we already live frugally and dont eat out or buy things we dont need i splurged on a few used books and new bb cream for my birthday this year     it probably sounds like a bunch of whining but it really sucks to feel like im running on a hamster wheel all the time getting nowhere ive worked my ass off for the last 20 years trying to escape the fate of my family and yet here i am i dont even want to be rich or not have to work i just want a professional job where i can afford food pay my bills go to the therapist and have a tiny bit extra at the end of the month so that i can save up for a dress or a meet up here and there     i dont even feel beautiful or confident enough to go out in the pieces i still own if i really want to dress up i just put on my old favorite dress and sit in my apartment
  rhijia is also a scalper they are apparently leaving lolita and have been for about 3 years but keeps acquiring new things from other sellers to resell at higher prices     they bought something from me and i found it with my description copy and pasted from my personal never worn by myself second owner etc to my damn terms and conditions and the fact that i had a cat     i asked them to make their own description and they told me i dont own the words i wrote in my description but i feel if you copy paste someones description you arent being honest to the buyer     avoid this cunt
  damn are you me anon     i really hope things get better for you i know he worked hard to get where he is but sometimes i think its unfair that the world favors men especially in the career world its so frustrating being passed over and/or not being taken seriously for better paying positions     to be fair the economy is in a shithole and our corporate and government overlords arent doing jack to adapt to the changes as it was throughout history the rich are getting richer while the rest of us are digging a hole and pitting against each other     sometimes i wonder what good it does contacting my representatives /     do you plan on going back to school
  shit i meant to clarify that i was referring to my boyfriend but im sure it might apply to yours     /sage
  are you me
  honestly i will probably never be able to afford to go back to school few things that interests me would be a good return on investment and i can barely afford to repay the debt i have now much less take on more     i try not to complain about it and mostly just hide away but this time of year is always hard for me thanks for reading
  work smarter not harder    if you want a professional job seek practical training that gets you certifications or bite the bullet and go for unpaid internships  since your bf supports you he most likely will encourage you to do something that will add to your resume/professional profile    i get it man life is hard af but you can string sentences together and reach out thru here so you are capable of doing things sometimes youre going to have to be your own life coach get with a workforce also dont look for jobs by yourself theres literally people whos job it is to help you find a job take advantage of it    reevaluate your resume and professional references go to your local library and rent out books that will help you become more articulate and demonstrate a stronger presence  companies want people that can be molded to suit their needs but have enough backbone to take punches and keep going you can do this
  her melty chocolate business done the young woman muttered a prayer common among her people nooooo concrit
good confession not really sure what thread would be best to post this in    im obsessed with classical piano motifs especially if they are only pink and white with no black ive been able to collect three of my all time favorite bags and ugh im just so happy i love going and just looking at them in my closet and adoring them     if you like this motif as well i recommend the 2008 bags over the 2010 one the 2008 ones are more of the sturdy material but the recital bag is super delicate im happy to have it but i cant wear it without fear of it falling apart even more
  i often incorporate nonlolita pieces to my lolita coords and viceversa for example i enjoy wearing a turtleneck sweater with a lolita skirt with lolita accessories and a vintage jacket    but unfortunately as you said  the volume of people with poor judgement would result in a majority vote of this is not loli or some such nonsense  and if it didnt come up to be nice i couldnt get any intersting advices to improve my coord but silly things like you can buy lolita blouses/jackets for cheap on bodyline
  it sounds like you are the one with poor judgement nothing wrong with wearing lolita pieces in normie outfits but if you go around calling it lolita people are probably gonna call you out/assume youre new    turtlenecks and ugly illfitting/unfashionable jackets bonus if theyre leather or something a grandma would wear are such staples of itas who are trying to tone down their lolita pieces and it just ends up looking really dowdy or mismatched most of the time its a common mistake as it really takes very keen coordination skills to make offbrand pieces work in a coord
  nayrt but i also incorporate turtle necks however i was already into high/alt fashion before lolita and have many turtlenecks/blouses in many styles and colours to match each coord i think for most people an interest in fashion and style came after their discovery of lolita instead of before it which is why we see so many girls in a prolonged state of ita they just cant seem to figure out casual or full coords
      this dress doesnt even look that smallits almost hanging off the model im a fatty chan but this isnt my taste anyway shit that splits the difference between fashion and cosplay bothers meif you want to dress like a certain character then go ballstothewall and do it faithfully with a cosplay dont drag a lolita dress into it but i could totally see my chunky sistren trying to squeeze into this because there are a lot of fat sm fans out there and when it happens i fully expect the gulls here to post them to the ita thread so we can all trash on the parade of barelyrestrained flesh    confession i hate watching other fatties destroy lolita clothing im not talking about welldone alterations that make the dress fit those are fine im talking about chunkies with no selfawareness who squeeze themselves into these poor dresses to the point that the shirring pops and theyre rippling and nearly bursting at the seams they give too much fuel to the skinny bitch camp that says lolita will never be for fatties and never look good on fatties
  fellow fattychan and i completely agree with your green text     and ngl lolita feels like one of the better fashions for heavier girls it hides a lot of your body and isnt revealing in any way and once you know what does/doesnt work and what brands cater to what its so easy to shop around girls are completely bullshitting when they say they cant get into the fashion because of their weight or bust size  maybe unless youre like 600lb life tier fat
  i completely agree with you doesnt matter that you dont own the words what matters is that they are being dishonest and thats scamming people for sure
  this boggles my mind the fact that they feel entitled to get defensive when they knowingly ripped you off    what am i supposed to sit down and take it when i spend my hardearned money on an item thinking it is going to be in the condition listed in the description only to find that i have spent way more on an item in such shitty condition than i ever would have had i known all the flaws it truly had you have no right to get defensive bitch  you know you did wrong and you need to deal with the consequences thats part of life  its called personal fucking responsibility
  t found a stain on a dress and wants a 50 refund
  thats not even an excuse anymore dollbe makes dresses literally for people that big
i wish ap would stop putting shirring on everything
  yeah no im not a bitch who would do that  thats absurd     i have bought items described as new never used before that were peeling scuffed up faded stained  none of this mentioned in the listing and dresses with several loose buttons stains and missing accessories that were never mentioned     sorry if i touched a nerve but as a seller youre not entitled to money for a product that isnt in the condition described overlooking a small flaw is only human and forgivable  thats no big deal but when you cant be assed to check an item thoroughly and disclose flaws that affect the condition to the buyer then thats just wrong     im not saying you cant civilly message a seller with your complaints  im not recommending being a belligerent asshole at all im just ranting on anon someone should just own up to their mistakes and try to make things right if they can that doesnt mean a 50 refund for a small stain it means a reasonable agreement
  sf is disguising tho anon i used to live there and it smells like exhaust urine and garbage in most places have you ever been to another major city before la and sf are two of the nastiest places around    if anything the butthurt sf lolitas only made it more apparent how far their heads are up their own asses since they think they live in the best city in the world
  as a tall ap fan i thoroughly disagree  though some of it is getting way too much
  even sacramento and san jose smell worse and theyre much smaller
  i like it it as long as there are corset lacing and waist ties you can make it go smaller and fit better than unshirred dresses
so no secrets this week
  most unshirred dresses fit me more comfortably than shirred dresses   im okay with some partial shirring with corset lacing but when you make the whole thing shirred or the whole back shirred its just annoying keep fatties out of lolita for fucks sake
  i always dread that some week will be the week that nothing gets submitted and bring about the end of the secrets maybe thats this week
  i had to sell on a lot of ap because of the shirring making it enormous and shapeless i have a few pieces from soufflesong that fit beautifully but i suppose they do offer several different sizes which probably helps
i dont understand people who say you must like the whole lolita fashion from the beggining to most recent releases oldschool looks so different to modern day lolita it may as well be a different fashion i see how someone could love old angelic pretty yet hate prints and vice versa but if you look at discussions about oldschool its always a shit show
  the worst thing is she doesnt even wash or iron them before scalping them she literally just put them up stained out of the package for 4x the original price
  you sound unfun
secrets are up praise be
  the salt was plentiful cheers gulls
i never thought id say this but i miss shitty 2012 tumblr styles creepy cute amo wigs the rise of legitimate jfashions other than lolita taobao threads in their heyday tumblr being the main jfashion social media and everyone and their mother blasting kyary on their page back then i thought it couldnt get worse but now i feel nostalgic
  limping along still i guess
  test
  i miss the original roots of larme kei it makes me nostalgic for some reason even though its not that old
  i have this with babylitas who are proinclusivity and/or have relative low self esteem like im not a mean person i do my best to be nice but i have pretty strong opinions and a lot are very harsh and not exactly proinclusivity nor lets all be friend mentality    i try to help if i can i try to be nice im always honest but i dont talk about my opinions unless its actually relevant and try to say it as well worded as i can without making it seem less than i think it is but these are the kind of people i know will get their feelings hurt by befriending me if they see my conversations with people let alone if they ask me advice im way too harsh direct and willing to point out anything that can be conceited to keep them happy
  nyart but i just wanted to say im also a lolita in a major slump and this got me thinking about my future again thanks a million anon for real happy to listen to any more advice you have on getting back into adult life after a long time out
  if you care you can look for the brands that do care about the source its a bit more price but they generally list where the leather comes from shoes start around 175 bags around 400 i know some european brands work together with farms in the richer countries because the cows are treated quite well here so marks are minimum and quality is quite good unlike the skin of half dead cows farmed in poor countries for leather often they use pig skin for lining as its soften and thinner without killing poor little calfs    sadly i dont know lolita brands that make stuff
  ah yes you should always move to a new place and tell all the locals how terrible it is    you sound autistic
  ive been a poor fag for many years and im still not rich at all altrough im not poor anymore either but i totally agree i wish people could just either save up and then buy stuff or stay away that time can immidiently be spend on research and thinking what you really want to own    the fashion is a luxury hobby if youre so poor you cant save up you should have different priorities if you can save up do so before you post photos online being poor doesnt say you cant develop a sense of what looks good and what not i would think that someone who knows whats its like to have little money would value each coin more and think about what they buy because they cant buy something like that as easily but instead we indeed end up with tasteless itas who do nothing but complain about not being able to afford some god damn luxury fashion    honestly i have harsh feelings for poorfags who keep on complaining even more so if they look bad while doing so you wont die without it its luxury those kind of people are the reason poorfags have a bad name while they could take their knowledge of knowing whats its like to have nothing or near nothing in their advantage too but if they got time to cry on social media so much im inclined to believe its their own fault their staying poor life aint fair and if your born in a less privileged place you need to work harder to get somewhere crying aint gonna fix your life beside for a lucky few there are way more productive ways to spend your time if you would worry about that instead of luxury fashion you refuse to save up for i would be able to take venting it off better as well
  turtleneck arent bad the right turtlenecks can look great in lolita even brands make them specifically for casual lolita but thats the issue i think itas with no sense of style see that and think they can just wear any cheap turtleneck they buy with a lolita skirt and be good and thats not how coording works there are many types of turtlenecks and you need the right shape in the right size colour and material for it to work    also hate to the use of normie cardigans by many itas extra hate for fat itas who wouldnt even be able to close said cardigan properly it seems a common too poor/fat to buy lolita stuff ita staple as well
  soufflé song is pretty crappy tho the only reason the stuff i saw from them fits okay is because the fabric is cheap synthetic thats somewhat stretchy so it shapes to your body
  yeah sf is nasty but it doesnt cling to my clothes jesus  that girl must have a hygiene problem
  i just wish more stuff was fitted for feminine roundings im tall and i can life with the length but god dam it give me something that doesnt rise in the front as soon as youre not flat its always so saddening when you buy brand the measurements fit in theory but the garment still raises because there isnt enough curve in the pattern to accommodate anything more than a b cup
  i agree to a point i love a lot of my unshirred dresses but i cant stand when dresses are fixed size and dont at least have corset lacing or waist ties they always fit baggy or not quite right for me i think quarter shirring helps make dresses look fitted as long as you arent too thin for the size     agree on the full back shirring though it looks terrible on most people fatties the front of the dress doesnt go far enough too thin its saggy it is really hard to look good in unless the cut is just right for your height
  haha thats not even what happened tho touched a nerve i see enjoy your 2000k a month closet with hobo pee on your doorstep
  nayrt but thats literally exactly what happened in the post in the sf comm she said i just moved here and proceeded to trash the city with her incidentally incorrect perceptions of it leaving smells on her burando     people were actually extremely nice about it at first offering her a few ways to save face and get out of a bad introductory post but she doubled down and decided to die on that hill she deserves what she got
is it just me or is this bitch really rude and has a mean girls attitude ive been seeing her comment snarky shit on peoples pictures on cof inb4 sore you got posted nah just a lurker and i got irked seeing her childish comments
  who are you quoting
  sorry snowflake but i like her
  i mean she says what everyone else is thinking we need bitches like her in the community desu
  ayrt i am completely capable of giving gentle concrit when asked these women are just lolitas need to be lovelies uwu types i feel as though any attempt to form a personal friendship with them would end terribly    she buys things in bulk/from japanese sites/etc and immediately tries to sell them for more than she paid all the positive reviews are because she mostly targets newbies who arent as wellversed in scouring japanese shopping sites/dont know any better  the western market is also relatively expensive in comparison to what you can get overseas      this is the kind of quality content im here for
  she buys things in bulk/from japanese sites/etc and immediately tries to sell them for more than she paid  this is probably the single best thing i learnt from cgl ever lol im so glad i didnt buy that dress from her in the end we live in the same country and i always checked her page i thought her prices werent the best but its so easy to buy from someone who lives in your own country well ill look elsewhere i guess
a lot of my dresses are too big for me i have to layer a lot to get them to fit so i dont look like im a young 1880s boy in makeup wearing a burando tent all the fattychans in my comm loudly complain at every meetup about their dresses not fitting but they get so whiny when nonplanets try to join the discussion    i try not to be judgmental about body types but they whine so much and then proceed to overeat at meetups so it doesnt seem like they try to lose weight i wonder if they get upset that thin people can at least wear the fashion without destroying their clothes
  the whole haha kill me i gained so much weight x doesnt fit me anymore conversation is so tired and awkward and yet i swear i hear it every single meet
  my weight used to fluctuate a lot and ive never been too big to fit something before maybe i just buy smarter  i buy what i know can fit me
      who was this about i missed it
  or the classic discussion of the diets theyre on that they never seem to stick to no one can even suggest that if they made an effort and worked out they would actually lose weight because that would hurt their feelings    weight fluctuation is usually within a range too putting on 40lbs of fat takes a lot of time of not doing anything about the weight gain
      t never experienced the devastation hormonal birth control can wreak on a mismatched body chemistry    count your blessings girls
  this is a thing and it happens happened to a friend of mine wrecked her body very sad but its so rare
  i can totally understand that as being a genuine issue that people cant do anything about really what bothers me is that if someone who isnt fat joins the discussion about fitting or not fitting dresses the treatment is totally different     if someone loses weight even if they dont mean to and their dresses get to be too big its apparently fine to dismiss them and say oh i wish i had that problem but those same people get upset if you dont give them asspats for not being able to squeeze into their dream dress
  its not actually rare at all its a relatively common side effect for most hormonal birth controls
    gaining weight directly because of birth control is entirely false and has been discredited over and over again girls keep using it as a cop out if you gain weight on bc it just means youre emotional eating and cant curb your cravings for fatty sugary things
  hormonal birth control  making you crave things and behave differently than you normally would  resulting in weight gain  entirely false  do you even listen to yourself
  keyword is directly
  you do realize theres more than one bc option out there  you dont need to put yourself through terrible side effects more than one thing works  but if you arent selfaware enough to recognize cravings/do something about sudden weight gain then you arent selfaware enough to change a bc that obviously isnt working for you
  thats not worth anything but a laugh from me especially if you end up getting the top tailored desu this might be a revolutionary idea to you get less shitty friends that push you into impulsebuying shit or even better dont blame your friends for your purchases admit you wanted an overpriced cosplay burando dress good luck not getting posted in the ita thread later
  ayrt its not that rare ive known half a dozen girls that went from kawaii sticks with thigh gaps the size of their thighs to nearly plus size and were never able to lose the weight even years down the road within four months of starting when it happens it happens fast and its usually irreversible because what changes is not how you eat for those months but your entire body chemistry and metabolism its far far beyond what could happen because of overeating fatty sugary things   is welcome to share these discredited over and over again studies considering that there are several dozen different chemicals prescribed as hormonal birth control in the course of its existence and basically no controlled study done on weight gain in humans for most of them shes talking out her ass google scholar is free
  yeah i sympathize with this  ive fluctuated just above and just below the size of fitting into burando for most of my adult life and even i experience the same from the kind of fatties who aggressively refuse to approach weight with anything but a selfcentered attitude but frankly its not causally connected to being fat those bitches would be selfcentered about something else if they were small
  of course im not tooting my horn but ive been almost completely independent since 18 im 26 yrs old now mom kicked me out after i graduated high school as a midterm so i basically crashed on peoples couches the first year i was out had to figure most of my adult shit out real quick    first thing to attend to was learning to budget i also started doing research on credit scores and made sure to apply for a low interest starter card thru my bank also helps to open a few checking accounts and distribute money across them once you have a job and get paychecks one strictly for necessities one for emergency fund one for recreational/hobby purchases etc    get an annual membership to a bulk place like costco sams whatever youll figure out how to set aside 45 or get someone to buy it for you stockpile the necessities and cook at home     this is the hardest part minimize your spending and only reward yourself when youve done something really fucking great of course what counts as a win for you is different from me but control how much you treat yourself    as for jobs i was stuck in a rut a lot of lowpaid entry level grocery store/fast food jobs for like 5 years the best decision ive made up to now workwise was switching to waitressing at a craft beer bar the hours suck my managers are ass and the customers can be annoying but i take an average of 100 home a day now not enough but much more than any customer service job find your niche and get good at talking about it to people bars are best imo because fuck slaving over tables of shitty families and their even shittier crotch spawn can you tell i hate kids lmao     workforces or job agencies are a lot more useful if youre not good at doing shit by yourself check local listings try to avoid using job search engines unless youre really good at selling yourself and have a good resume
  my doctor attributed my weight gain to my birth control considering my diet has not changed at all and ive always cooked home cooked healthy meals and have overall lived a healthy lifestyle i gained 40 lbs within a year on it he took me off of it and i lost 6 lbs within the first month no change in anything my doctor is sure it was the birth control and considering hes the one with the phd im going to go with his opinion on this
  google scholar is free  but actually reading and determining legitimate sources isnt unless your sudden hormonal imbalance completely nuked your thyroid theres meds for that your metabolism will never be that fucked beyond repair also thermodynamics are a thing  hormonal birth control can cause weight gain as a side effect but going on the /correct/ birth control will counteract those measures its like people saying pcos made them obese when an effective treatment for pcos is in fact weight loss    my confession is a lot of westerners but mostly burgers seriously need to get their shit together in terms of nutrition and exercise before they even think about stepping out in lolita just because its normal doesnt make it right
  you have a pathological lack of empathy and you should probably go fuck yourself
this is why i never get in the birth control argument i am well versed in it and its side effects but you crazy people on literally all sides accuse everyone of everything to keep your world view
  unless your sudden hormonal imbalance completely nuked your thyroid theres meds for that  this is actually what happened to me because of my bc     i got rid of the bc got on thyroid meds and lost 40 pounds over the next 5 months    even at my worst though i found a way to do enough exercise and eat 1200 cal a day to mantain my weight but if i ever screwed that up i gained weight like instantly it was miserable    glad to be getting back to normal though
  agree i was fat as fuck on birth control now im 40 lbs lighter and am still recovering from how fucking sick it made me
  if you want to play that game then it goes both ways please provide scholarly articles proving birth control does cause weight gain and that youre not talking out your ass go
  congrats though i still need to lose another 30 pounds to be normal but i think i can get there    i know im somewhat normal again though because ive finally hit a weight where just eating normally healthy doesnt make me lose a ton of weight anymore my body has lost all the weight it could from just dieting and light exercise now i just need to up my exercise to really push it the rest of the way
  anon nayrt but like ive been on two different kinds and one was fine but made me ill and the other one made me gain 40 lbs i couldnt lose no matter how hard i tried so i got off of them and now im back to my normal weight before that disaster sorry you dont understand that hormonal pills cause hormonal issues
  i believe in you anon i lost my weight over the course of a year and i honestly didnt do too much to fix it i dont think i exaggerate when i say i eat only bbq meat and candy im a monster with a bad protein defincincy so dont like stress out too much about it just stay healthy
  this is personal experience in an uncontrolled environment meaning it really has no grit i never gained any weight on three different kinds of hormonal bc so its just my truth versus yours     having said that i quit hormonal bc five years ago and never looked back i honestly dont believe in it anymore the more i learned about it the hormonal kind so im not advocating that its perfect and great either
  yeah anon prove your point by posting the studies you literally just claimed to be nonexistent    nayrt but jesus christ youre ignorant as fuck
  id say i hope you get knocked up but you dont really sound like the kind of person for whom thats much of a risk anyway
  how is this ignorant someone challenged me to cough up studies because apparently they were triggered by my post how is asking them to do the same to support their side unreasonable if anyone is claiming that hormonal bc directly causes weight gain i honestly want to read the study because all ive heard so far is wah i got fat      lolololol    1 theres bc thats not hormonal  2 i actually want to get pregnant so go ahead
  heres a cool anecdote for you i think my pill made me lose weight due to the intense nausea it gave me i was hovering around 130 before the pill now im 118 but it has now given me bowel issues so my stomach is permabloat hormonal birth control sucks
  i hate how when you have a bad experience with birth control youre told to try another like it is just a walk in the park usually you have to be on one pill for three months minimum to really settle into it and see what the long lasting side effects will be most doctors wont let you switch without have tried the pill for 3 months or so then you can try a new pill and start the whole process over again sure you might not have side effects this time or it could be worse its russian roulette
  oh god the diets the fattychans in my comm all eat like shit order only highcarb highfat dishes push any vegetables off their plate because theyre yucky and then whine theyre still hungry and want to get dessert but claim they actually eat super healthy and just cant lose weight because of their genetics then every few months they try some shitty crash diet for like a week dont immediately become misakosized give up and take that as irrefutable proof that its physically impossible for them to lose weight ive seen it happen over and over and over again and its so awkward because they talk about it every single meetup and if you say anything but oh you poor baby yes theres nothing you can do they complain that youre shaming them one girl said that she went jogging one time literally one time and it hurt her legs so clearly exercise is not a healthy option for her i suggested swimming because its a great fullbody exercise thats easy on the joints and i personally love swimming but that was apparently shaming too another girl tried to convince me that my boyfriend is emotionally abusive because he fills out portions of chips into bowls instead of letting people eat the entire bag in one go call me un empathetic all you want but ive given up on reasoning with these people
  i feel this anon its why i dont interact with my comm much anymore that group is full of lolitasatheart and overweight whiners who want brand so bad but dont want to put the effort in to get it    i guess i have a confession related to this i block any person who has im speshul delusions on facebook/insta/twitter etc i typically give them a pass the first time unless they are insufferable at a meet but as soon as they keep on their excersize is ableist or diets dont work train with nothing to back it up other than how their feelings gets hurt when they remain fat after one day of trying something im done i used to be close friends with one girl until i had coffee with her alone one day i hadnt seen her since i had lost a substantial amount of weight which she commented on and then turned the conversation around on herself and claimed that she could never count calories or pay attention to what food was doing to her or else she would get depressed unprompted she ranted about diet culture to me i was unsurprised when she continued the rant on facebook later that day im glad i blocked her
  cutting contact with a close friend over a weight loss rant    women were a mistake
reading all this stuff about bc is really making feel anxious well i should say more anxious since i already was i have pcos and im not sure whether       an effective treatment for pcos is in fact weight loss    is true maybe it is for overweight people but i am underweight and i cant lose more weight / so i have to get on bc for 6 months and ugh i really dont want to gain weight before my period i usually have this insane crave for food and i really really hope i wont be like that every time every day when im on bc
  inb4 anon tells you that doctors can be wrong
  4chan finally releases us from its website and we still get shitty crossboarding trolls
  thats cause the domains are related stupid its never going away
  also pcos anon here i do get some mood effects from bc but since bc is actually fixing a hormone deficiency in us we typically dont get nearly as bad side effects your obgyn should be prescribing you bc thats more specific for pcos than the general stuff other people get    pcos is also expressed differently in a lot of people it /does/ cause weight gain for some and weight loss /does/ help it for some but not everybody    im not underweight but i am skinny and havent had any weight gain on or off bc     if it helps im on a kariva generic
  start naming birthcontrols that make everyone lose weight then
  i believe people mix it up a lot with increased appetite which happened to atleast me but clamed down after a year otherwise its hard to say from my own experience since i started when i was 17 so a lot could be just natural changes but now its suddenly causing me tons of side effects again which could lead to weight gain eventually because they affect my appetite mood and cause me pain and im talking about the pill
  high carb dishes   so as a fatty chan should i be trying to avoid carbs i heard it was impossible to avoid them entirely
  ive been gaining and losing weight since puberty its my own personal hell my metabolism is super slow im always tired and i will gain weight/fat insanely fast in order to look good id have to be under 1500 calories a day and work out and lately my life has become so stressful i lack the motivation since i want to wear lolita more often again im dragging my sorry ass to the gym regularly and weigh all my food
  yeah its pretty much impossible to avoid them entirely   there are low carb diets but if you want to lose weight and stay thin over a long period of time its better to make healthy life style choices instead of just following a short term diet     there are different kinds of carbs and a lot of foods that contain carbs are actually really healthy vegetables fruits nuts oats etc so if you consume those in reasonable amounts youre gonna be fine   carbs have a bad reputation because theyre also in a lot of foods like white bread pastries candies chips  just junk food over all basically  dont try to focus too much on carbs or try to cut them out entirely instead make healthy food choices in general
  your mother having you was clearly a mistake thats for sure
  anon my doctor told me the side effects were going to be weight gain with the pill stop acting retarded     i was in the nexplanon but when that made me physically ill with morning sickness on the daily and insane mood swings i took it out and tried a pill i dont remember the name of it right this second but i know i was in the same environment i was in when i was on nexplanon and youve gotta be a complete retarded fuckhead to not realize that different people have different side effects with medication maybe i wasnt on it long enough to make the weight gain leave but it still happened even for others they might not notice it but the extra hormones added to your body on the pill does make you want to eat more or leaves you feeling less full after eating so even if t was a dietary issue its still a side effect of the birth control and i think every single person i know whos been on depo has gained anywhere from 2060 pounds im actually not even exaggerating there i had a kitchen manager who i was close with tell me about how she started taking depo and she ended up 60 lbs heavier without a change in her diet she didnt mind it too much but it did happen my own mom is on depo and she gained 40lbs in a month and i watched my mom struggle hard to keep a steady diet that was healthy three years later and now off of the shot her steady diet thats not some stupid health fad and shes lost almost all of that weight im proud of her     get your head out of your ass and for the love of god please stay on that birth control forever for the sake of humanity
  isnt rainies just a second hand store though why are wunderwelt lolita desu and closet child ok but not that one dont they all basically do the same
  rainies is an italian girl who sells as a private on lacemarket she buys things for cheap only to resell them at a higher price
  those stores have people go to them to buy their clothes and they sell it second hand its a legit business rainies uses ss to snipe cheap stuff from yja and others and marks up for a profit its not
    which means shes not a business and probably doesnt have to have her income taxed etc though idk how things go in italy fk rainies i recently saw her post on fb so now im glad to put a face/real name to the username
  show the pic
can we just agree that birth control affects everyone differently and be done with the subject this is a secrets/confession thread take your personal opinions outside of the fashion and shit up your fb timelines with it instead
  businesses dont get taxed either here in italy eheh     jokes apart what picture
  im a huge sailor moon faggot and i was at first kinda excited when i heard about ap and aatp doing sm collabs     but all i got was a halfassed fairy marine recolor and this sorry excuse im glad i dont miss out on anything but it didnt stop me from making this face when i saw them in lolita updates
   i just read up insulin resistance on wikipedia and it says a big deficit is a good thing like under 1000 calories i really read a lot abot nutrition because i dont eat meat cant eat too much gluten and im allergic to most nuts and fruit   i can rememberr a time when my waist was 63cm last year i was down to 68 i want to get down to that again to fit into my dresses nicely
  the lower your weight goes the less it has in reserve its going to depend per person what they need and clearly you are feeling weak the way you are doing things now for me any less than 1400 calories and i feel like death in your case if youre getting enough food for your weight then maybe you arent eating the right things at such a large deficit your food is already going to need to be nutritionally dense that doesnt mean all meat just minimally processed and lots of greens i dont eat much fruit at all your diet sounds pretty restrictive at this point i think asking your doctor is probably the best idea
  fuck off rainies you are not the same as legit lolita second hand stores      just search rainies in the lolita sales in english fb group
so this has to do with both lolita and cosplay but me and some friends exposed this girl back in high school   she a well known cosplayer in the area los angeles   happens to do lolita and has her own fashion line all at the ripe age of 15   day sittting next to her in   class  hey sphenoid wanna see my cosplays that i worked on with the help of this bitch my mentor yaya han   me   this aint it senpai  its literally a picture of a shit quality lumpy space princess cosplay that is not of herthe only thing they have in common was morbid obesity  oh no fuck this bitch shes too much   my web friends they hate her too cause she pulled other shit in them   decide to make her regret this shit post memes of her al over social media specifically about this encounter    eventually moves to the continuation school next door claiming her business venture with yaya han keeps her too busy to focus on school  this bitch
  you must be 18 to use this site anon and even if you are we generally dont tear apart kids a lot of us had an awkward stage
    i have this suspicion that in light of the recent boycott against rainies and other scalpers by gulls they will take to posting on anon with a different email/possibly paypal on the bst threads without disclosing who they are     like their business probably wont suffer all that much since newbies and such will still buy their stuff but they can target us through this very board using anonymity against us
  i make the cutoff for age  yea my awkward faze sucked but this girl no maam
  gulls are the ones who browse secondhand sites and i doubt it those scalpers would do that in the first place
  different paypal  kek yes they should totally do this rainies cherry_sp gemgem chestnutlili etc make at least 3 paypal accounts be sure to link the same address credit cards or bank accounts too so it will be safe
  iirc one of them has 2 lace market accounts one selling jane marple shit and the others selling normal stuff
  exactly it would be oh so very anonymouse hacker known as fourchan to catch the scalpers in the act and be able to bring them down     i know this is very unrealistic but still my paranoid brain wishes it would happen
  i know but the jane marple shit was resold from ww lots too unfortunately thats not against lms rules same for treating lm like a literal shop front instead of a private selling platform and actually making rules wouldnt help anyway because lm isnt enforcing them just look at gemgems proof pictures directly stolen from the listings she scalpes or at all of the taobao resellers that keep going even though only 3 offbrand/indie items taobao included are allowed
  wait a minute how is she able to have 2 accounts with only one pp
    not cumming all over your burando for you to lick it all up    now thats how to do birth control
  hm thats against paypals policy and tos its not like we dont know where they are from
      alright but not all japanese stores you mention have a physical location lolita desu is online only    and based on the fact that all of these are second hand stores they probably also bid on japanese auctions and get from various second hand sources then add a price on top of that and then sell this is literally the description of selling second hand    plus rainies states they are a shop first thing in their tems of sale    so genuine question what is it about this particular store that bugs you that much is it a weeaboo thing because they are not from the glorious land of nippon i am genuinely curious here
  again fuck off rainies
tfw when you are a lolita pretending to be a crossboarder pretending to be a lolita    im sorry gulls i know its detrimental to the board quality but you take the bait so easily im not going to give up my little dopamine rushes
  because they are up front about it and the ones that arent ie taobo resellers are also disliked they pay for their own site domain they arent selling on a marketplace specifically designed for peertopeer private sales of your own goods surely if you werent desperately trying to defend your own dodgy practices you would realise the dishonesty in what youre doing such as specifically buying items you know have higher value in the western market purely for the profit
  you really think she operates as a store what is her business then what service is she offering what the name of her business and how can i talk to them also her is her selling under her fb as a person not a business     second hand stores like lolita desu have people come to them they arent buying online to resell you think your thrift shop going into stores and buys stuff to resell too
  dont try to defend rainies/yourself because that just wont work is she doing something illegal no is she doing something immoral yes also if tomorrow i start saying im a gym i dont magically became a gym lol the fact she says shes a shop has no value she simply is not one she is a private seller who marks up the price of items sold by good people who put a fair price to their stuff its because of people like her that the western market is so shitty and with nonsensical prices
  good luck i hope you can figure something out anyway sorry for spamming so much off topic     my confession i bought a dream dress i could have gotten one size bigger but went for my goal sizing instead its my motivation im the kind of person that needs something on the horizon to work for    looks like everyone here hates fatties but talking about it and actively educating yourself makes you /fit/
  looks like everyone here hates fatties  i dont whether you consider yourself overweight/fatty or not good luck with your goal
      again not ranies which is why your rage is completely puzzling to me i dont care if discussing this here with you makes it even worse for her because i dont know her i am just irked when people have double standards and like to discuss about it keeping calling me rainies and calling anyone that has a different opinion than your mob mentality the name of x person is retarded even for 4chan     i guess it must be a sensitive topic for you gulls because you have yet to prove to me how this store is different than lolita desu    what is her business she sells second hand clothes just like lolita desu as for the name of the store as far as i remember it is rainies     you do realize that the good people that put their stuff up for sale are the same people that sell to wunderwelt and all these places right do you know how much do these good honest stores buy the shit they sell you for almost retail price because if you dont you can check their want to buy listings   do you guys know where these sellers would end up if they were not selling to cc and ww you guessed it right at the auctions whatever cc ww and ld sell you would be getting for cheaper if they didnt exist
  youre not making any sense anon   has already told you in what way rainies is different than a legit secondhand web store yet you keep insisting if youre not rainies it makes even less sense for you to defend her like this just drop it
  rainies buys form yahoo auctions and scalps them also
  woa ugly shit  dont people whiteknighting her feel bad
  if youre not her drop it  god this fucking mentality is why people keep responding everyone is anon quit trying to guess who everyone is
  late addition from someone who has also been out on their own since their late teens more focused on breaking in to officetype work once you have a college / uni degree and based on north american experiences so may not apply outside canada/us    google for recruitment companies in your area they can help you with skill evaluation resume prep and setting up interviews plus help you identify weak areas that you can address with selfteaching via libraries and online resources legit recruiters are paid by the company not by you its basically the company outsourcing part of their hr department to the recruiter     dont be afraid of taking contract jobs theyll help build your resume and contacts and if you do a great job your manager is likely to find a way to try and keep you on    invest in a good midtier tailored work suit before you buy more lolita/cosplay if youre aiming for office work good shoes too people immersed in corporate culture pay attention to that stuff spend a little time at an office building area during lunch and check out what people are wearing thatll give you a good ballpark for standards in your area    check your local library for careerskill related books a basic knowledge of marketing project management and accounting can be a huge help in interviews varies depending on the kind of role youre looking for of course being able to parrot the current corporate lingo dumb as it often is helps reassuring hiring managers that youll fit in around the office
  anon the reason everyone thinks youre her is because you keep defending these practices    shes not a business she doesnt have a business license she does not have a shop/storefront/website she sells these items from if you took time to notice that all of the secondhand websites and even the sss have both store fronts websites or at least a facebook page to display their items along with a lacemarket account selling as a private individual is not a business buying clothing for dirt cheap and marking the price up 50200 is not a sound business practice yes we shit on businesses who do this too like how all of us agree devilinspired is a scalping taobao reseller also if she received donations or someone came to her to sell it for her thats a different story     so even if she was a business or whatever shed still be running a horrible business and she needs to rethink her strategies     honestly why doesnt she just chill the fuck out she knows we all fucking hate her and most of her shop items wont get bought for like 67 months
  quit trying to guess   i didnt try to guess i just took into consideration that she could be rainies which is something the anons before me took for granted can you even read     this fucking mentality is why people keep responding   how new are you this is fucking 4chan nothing to do with mentality
    im calling you rainies because other then defending her for no reason your knowledge about lolita has to be on the same level like someone who only cares for the fashion for profits aka rainies but okay ill answer properly  lolita desu is online only  lolita desu started out as a reseller too just like kitty carousel i dont know why youre bringing her up i dont see her at the same level like the official second hand stores because of that     and based on the fact that all of these are second hand stores they probably also bid on japanese auctions and get from various second hand sources then add a price on top of that and then sell  no they dont if youd actually be a lolita whos regulary stalking the second hand market you would notice that quickly non of the legit second hand stores do that because guess what its shady  private people offer their items to them either in person or online/postal they get an offer based on condition and they either agree or decline    this is literally the description of selling second hand  lmao what kind of shitty empty rhetoric is this the description of selling second hand is selling something used     plus rainies states they are a shop first thing in their tems of sale  they changed it very recently and like the other anon mentioned aaying youre a shop alone doesnt make you one     is it a weeaboo thing because they are not from the glorious land of nippon i am genuinely curious here  no youre not youre using shitty bait to get the most yous rainies is not a shop she is a private seller like anyone else on lacemarket without any legal responsibilities if youd actually read the thread its not only rainies that bugs us either    as for the name of the store as far as i remember it is rainies   she has no name because she has no store her username on lm is rainies as far as i remember her pp isnt a business account either
    cont  you do realize that the good people that put their stuff up for sale are the same people that sell to wunderwelt and all these places right   no they arent they are selling their stuff on mercari frill and yahoo auctions they cant sell them there and on cc/ww/etc at the same time     do you know how much do these good honest stores buy the shit they sell you for almost retail price   yes i do but people offer it to them alone instead of putting it up themselves thats the difference these items wouldnt have been available anyway because the people wouldnt put them up otherwise they chose to sell it for cheap to these shops for some reason instead of selling it themselves     do you guys know where these sellers would end up if they were not selling to cc and ww you guessed it right at the auctions   they chose to cc and ww over auctions even though it would make them much more money it wouldnt end up there because they already decided against it despite being more lucrative
    we should stop answering her with logic she clearly is either rainies or retarded     but good answer
i just want meta or just brands in general to release some skirts
  thank you im definitely a fatty but far less fat than i was a year ago i hope you find your dream dress and it fits well too
    thanks same to you well soon look great  and i dont think everybody hates fatties its all about attitude  there are cute chubsters and entitled planets
  meta releases plenty of skirts though especially during lucky pack season baby does lots of skirt releases as well
  well damn i need to pay better attention then
  lolita desu doesnt fucking flood the online sales comms with her shit she operates as an actual online store
ive tried for years to find my niche within lolita to fit myself in and i think ive found it nothing makes me happier than sweet ap pic related is my ideal silhouette and if you can get a berry print in there even better ive been trying to play down how much i love it by saying sure i wear strange fluffy dresses but at least im not sweet thats a completely fucked up mentality ive never felt cuter than when i wear these stupid frilly pink eyesores and i love it    im not a cute person so i probably look strange but who cares my confession is that i flagrantly love sweet
  this is so wholesome anon live your best sweet life
  do you have this list im not super educated on whos a scalper so itd be useful
  i just took into consideration that she could be rainies  could be anyone you fucking stubborn ass
      this is why the birth control is fucking terrifying to me i know this isnt the case for everyone but you cant tell how it will effect you until you go on it
  is this the tripfag formerly known as don kanonji
  dont buy from the b/s/t thread to begin with ive bought a lot of secondhand dresses from various places and only one of the dress i got in the b/s/t here was as described gulls are gross dont wash things and lie about condition lm ive also had a bad experience on but way more positive ones
  ugh fuck kitty carousel i hated seeing those posts on lj    fuck lolita desu too i wondered why they were so overpriced and their shipping is insane makes sense now
im really looking forward to the btb secrets this week im curious how many secrets will be posted about the sfe drama
  same ive always disliked lolita desu
  good for you anon its fine to shift between styles too you dont need to marry yourself too just one at the same time though if sweet makes you feel happy and fulfilled then go for it dont be a coward in the face of happiness
  no im the artist formerly known as prince         thank you
  its just going to be repeats of what was said here
  i feel bad now because they gave me a 5 voucher for applying to their illustrator position
confession it bothers me that i just found out a woman from my comm models jfashion and lolita for popularity points but then turns around and markets the clothing and the comm to ageplayers through reddit i dont need more of them tainting my favorite hobby
  kind of hard to blame my weight gain on burgers when i havent eaten meat since high school ive always worked out 30 minutes to 2 hours about 34 times a week so it wasnt that either ive been on the exact same routine for the last 5 years the only difference in my life during the time i was gaining excessive weight was the birth control i was on
im anon  thanks everyone who tried reassuring me about bc i will talk with an obgyn asap 
  burger in this context is slang for american but yeah i had the same situation as you i even doubled my workout routine and tightened my diet when i noticed i was gaining weight at a rate of about 4lbs a month because my doctor kept telling me it was just because id hit my 20s and my metabolism was slowing down it wasnt until id gained 40lbs that they actually looked at my file said oh we just put you back on the depo provera shot in january and thats when the weight gain started that they even considered another point of view than just im lazy and lying about my diet/exercise as soon as i got off the shot i stopped gaining weight it was difficult to lose but eventually it happened
i have a confession completely unrelated to the last half of the thread    i just bought doubles of a brand dress i love not only do i own it in every colorway but i will also now own two of one of those colorways exact same cut and everything my goal is to own doubles of each     is this an insane thing to do does it seem greedy i feel greedy i feel like if i had unlimited money id indefinitely try to buy up every one of these dresses on the secondhand market i love it too much
  those trips  imo yes it kind of is if you arent a daily lolita or wear the dress a lot to the point its falling apart i too sometimes get the impulse when i see a dreamdress again that i already acquired but actually buying it again seems kind of stupid to me
  im probably just stupid and insane then haha i dont wear my dresses daily but i dress up fairly often and this is the one dress i feel this way about to be fair my old colorway was a little bit faded and i always wanted to get another but at the same time i dont intend to sell the double like a normal person would
  you do you anon as long as you arent buying all the existing dresses that would be 100 insane i think its okay
  my goal is to own doubles of each  but why
ten years ago i have only ever heard the term lolita in one context     so im at anime expo with my ex and i ask her what cosplays she brought oh this this and do you like lolita  ew what kinda sick fuck are you     wasnt until the next day i found out it was a fashion term
  as long as you can afford it i think its a really good idea seriously i will do this with my ultimate dds if possible  its not like a simple tshirt you can find everywhere when it needs replacing that makes it a good reason to double up imo  i dread ruining/damaging a favourite/dd and if id had a backup man that would feel so good    as for owning a print/cut in several colourways that is my guilty pleasure too as long as you can afford it why settle for just one colour/cut when you love 2 or more eh
  doubles of one dress are fine but if you start snatching up every single one you see and end up with 5 of the same dress then i think thats kind of greedy it might be somebody elses dd too but i agree with  its useful in case of damages    owning multiple cuts/colorways is great though
  i have multiple of my dd and several colorways of the same dress if you love something and know you look good in it why not haha
lately ww reorders newly listed items by type or some brand new items dont appear on the first page but a few pages back does anyone else have that problem i missed out on a wishlist item because of this and now im p sad
    i saw the phrase ultimate dds and i just thought you meant you had huge titties
i hate how western communites distorted the look of lolita through guides for newbies   i know its a hot take but when you look at what was popular and what the guides were talking about you can see a correlation what westerners were wearing did affect the brands even if it wasnt anything major   when milanoo started putting out their first awful dresses and newbs started flooding in rather than say have eyes and a functioning brain they came up with stuff like  black and white is bad  a lot of lace is bad  raschel lace is bad  lolita must be modest  i also blame the its not a costume and its not related to the book screeching for this  look at ita thread now except for vendettas people posted there look really bad and exemples of an iconic ita are rare i cant help but feel that these girls stumble across fyeahlolita and think that if they dont wear lace monsters they are all good its the same blog that also says that bodyline and taobao are fine too
  i think the main problem with the article is that it has aged poorly  i remember when i was a newbie i believed in all the misconceptions you just listed bodyline was only considered good because it was one step up from milanoo garbage that was far more rampant at the time if i was to rewrite that article i would focus of teaching newbies to dress for their shape the importance of high quality material and colour coordination i also believe that people recited those rules without really understanding the reasoning of abiding by them or questioning why
  i think its really smart especially if its something you wear often itd be nice to have a spare in case one gets damaged or worn out i have doubles of some basic items and multiple colorways of my favorite prints although i dont yet have doubles of a fancy dream dress i dont think its a crazy idea    im really curious which dress it is that you collect though i understand if you wouldnt want to share
i think im better than most lolitas because i have nice natural hair and dont have to wear shitty wigs all the time its a good color and will style pretty well for all my lolita needs  im also glad i dont have to buy so many shitty wigs
  i feel kinda bad that everyone is assuming i have these doubles of my dream dress its not actually my dream dress i still dont have my dd which is a solid and ive never even see it sold secondhand in fact i wouldnt really want doubles of my dd because it would quickly lose significance     the dress i now have doubles of is actually just my favorite print dress of all time and i really cant decide which colorway is my favorite the print is 7 years old and by ap and something in my brain just tells me i have to gather the remaining good condition dresses or they might just become lost to time i keep sounding more insane but thats the truth
  so you spent money on a dress you consider your favorite but didnt buy your dream dress do you not need to sit on money in case it does pop up
old thread 404d     matenrou opera tour finale this weekend     august is full of new releases and lives anything youre looking forward to ready for brands to release fall/winter collections
  no clue it was the same as always     datura new single on the 8th its their last release before disbandment
jupiter is also releasing a new single on the 8th with their new vocalist he has no eyebrows but an amazing voice to make up for it
  he is an adorable person as well too bad his mic was so soft during the live
  im excited to hear more from the now i was a fan of atsushi kuze when he was in concerto moon so i cant wait to see what he does in jupiter
wrouge released sneak peaks of their a/w collection with some available to buy today i like it
matenrous tour finale was great sono sang a new ballad that was really beautiful he also promised that matenrou will continue on so please do not worry about them even though there have been two member changes they said theyll be writing new music for the next two months so we can expect something next year yo and jay were hysterical they kept picking on sonos accent the banter was great at the very end they pointed to the back and yu was in the guest balcony its nice to see that even though he cant play anymore hes on stage in spirit
  didnt sono also announce a solo project im pretty interested to hear it sono has such a nice voice it will be nice to hear him try something different
  yeah he did i think ill probably go to the live release hes thrown so much into matenrou im kind of interested to hear if this is a different sound
  im excited for their last single it sucks that they are disbanding though i hope to see miel in another band
  im going tonight miel usually runs their merch booth hes been very kind to me over the last year that ive gone to their lives id love to talk about guitar stuff with him since we use a lot of the same stuff gil has my heart though hes just funny
say something nice to him
  well i bought the new single and a tshirt so i get a group picture and one with my favorite member   紅染マ and 黒い11月 were both enjoyable to me its weird being back at lives with less than 20 people total but its kind of enjoyable too
        this makes me so jealous ill never be able to go to japan go see lives hang out with bandmen go drinking talk about gear  why even live at this point lol
  never say never ill take you to some lives if you ever make it here and we can go to the vkei bar my friends work at and talk gear
  ill let you know if that happens 
would anyone be interested in having some small community activities for our vkei general i was thinking maybe we could make a playlist together or do some polls
  i miss having people that appreciate the music to talk to all the girls here are crazy bangya im sitting there wondering what effect pedal someone is using and the girl next to me is more interested in his dick so im down for anything that furthers love of the genre     also ayato called me a cumdumpster whichever one of you american fans taught him that wtf why ww
  i would love that  i really miss the days where we could share music and talk about it without it boiling down to i want to fuck that guy i would love to talk to other chill vk fans about the music      it was probably one of the girls at tnt who were there just to try and get with them i knew a few of them that went just for that purpose
where is klaha
    glad you guys are interested im actually a straight dude who looks up to vkei musicians as inspiration not a fangirl i want to be like then not be with them    what kind of guitar is your main instrument i play an esp ltd b205 5string bass i just got a fender squire jazzmaster baritone guitar too    i believe manasan has contact with him but cant get him to come out of retirement id bet more on juka coming out of retirement these days
  iirc mana said he couldnt get in contact with him for 25th anniv so hes effectively mia    i wish hed at least show up to say hes alright i miss him
  i think youre right i just remember mana saying something about possibly getting a phone call with him i might have misinterpreted him though
  edwards horizon iii145 pearl white  sounds fantastic but the humidity here makes the floyd rose bridge incredibly obnoxious
  are you cantavanda
  one of my friends is convinced she is friends with klaha on facebook and that they are best friends if you try and tell her that its most likely not klaha she flips out and wont believe you
  nope i just got a twitter recently though   croixrei
  hahaha i was once convinced that hizaki and mia blocked me on facebook i realize now it was definitely roleplayers luckily im not retarded anymore so i dont like mia and i report roleplay accounts
  well this girl is also convinced she is in a relationship with kaya and both kaya and klaha live together one day she may realize how stupid she sounds but i dont see it happening anytime soon
  sweet ill follow ya
  i followed you as well
  some people are just delusional especially in this fanbase i know a lot of people like youre describing  speaking of kayalets talk about his recent activities  specifically why is he doing this to us
  to me it seems like he is trying to get more into the western drag scene i love the look but monday monday was not his best single ill still follow his activities but im not to impressed with the direction he is going musically
  i believe weve had this exact conversation a couple threads ago im remembering now
  because drag is hot right now and hes probably making some extra money with this direction its certainly widened his fan base       fuck yeah role players are creepy like an anime character or book character or something sure fine whatever role playing an actual person is creepy though also yes mia is trash
  i dont think its widened his fanbase more like changed it a lot of young female drag fans are into him now i know for instance a good friend and i both vkei fanboys are basically just chilling back with femme fatale and ignoring his new stuff i loved yumeji though so yeah hoping for kaya to do more rock more of his visual pop style more schwarz stein just not drag
  i also really enjoyed femme fatale i wish they were together longer it felt like kaya was finally finding his voice in the band   schwarz stein has a new single coming out in september and hora is also releasing a new album soon
  oh i forgot about horas album thank you for reminding me and i didnt know about the ss single 0
  its actually a new mini album it will be released on september 1st and is entitled immortal verses you can buy it through horas website   im probably going to pick it up im a huge schwarz stein fan so it will be nice to add some music to my collection i have most of their discography already
  i was so into them before but the femme fatale breakup kind of gave me some sort of kaya related trauma haha i used to worship him thats why his new stuff bothers me even more than most people
  same the femme fatale breakup was such a surprise to me they were doing so well and were hinting at a world tour and a new album and then they broke up it really shocked a lot of people i really regret not seeing them when they performed at pmx
  the sound system was awful but they put on a great and memorable show
  i heard through other support staff that they had a lot of disagreements which is why initially the drummer left suddenly creative minds dont always get along haha
  apparently he didnt regret doing it in the first place though he was happy to sign this for me more than 2 years after he left
  oh hes a really nice person though i do always wonder how he remembers or decided how many es to put after his name i might ask him if i see him again lol i dont cross over to the normal metal scene too often anymore though
are there any newer bands with neoclassical elements that arent signed to starwave  nothing against starwave i just already know and love those bands  seems like not a lot of elegant gothic stuff comes out these days
  not worshiping based egggod    serious answer though aiolin the lead of the band sings plays lead guitar piano and violin he uses arpeggios and stuff if thats what you mean by more neoclassical elements i like his stuff    unfortunately a lot of the truly neoclassical influenced bands versailles jupiter matenrou viisense etc are going to be the older guys who were basically born with a guitar in their hand lol a lot of the newer bands are glorified hosts that can play some power chords that describes most of my friends too haha
  i know aiolin theyre great
  actually speaking of jupiter the new single is super heavy i really like all 3 tracks kuzes english lyrics are quite well done too     dragging my ass all the way down to ochanomizu for the release event today they kind of made people choose teru/rucy one day and hizaki/daisuke/kuze another day i work the day with 3 members but it would have been cool to meet kuze
    also  a lot of the newer bands are glorified hosts that can play some power chords  thats true for all eras of vkei its not new i personally find nothing wrong with using ones looks to make money however i find it detestable for a bandman to have sex for money  i generally only listen seriously to bands that i can tell have serious effort behind their music bands like the ones you named other examples being kiryu gallo sibilebashir chanty develop ones faculties scarlet valse vampire rose  but ill listen to anything casually sometimes i listen to something cheesey and uncomplicated if i just like the sound or the vocals
  hey well thats pretty awesome i like the single too i need to get the cd
whats the funniest live report youve read  i was going through inertias old lj reports and found this gem      some highlights  kamijo brought a girl in a sexy skimpy outfit and mask onstage and led her to the sofa she sat there mayu went and sat next to her and she slithered all over him sticking her tongue down his throat and then as he played the slides in the instrumental intro she slithered more on him i had an unfortunately clear view of what she did to mayu then mayu got up and kamijo sat down on the couch to be slithered on o kamijo turned his head when he kissed her so all i saw of that was his hair thank god for small mercies
  hahaha  the funniest live report i ever read was when the vocalist of vajra decked a girl in the face good shit
alright friends heres my first community activity  lets have a poll  vote for your favorite dir en grey album
  christ i forgot the link  
  macabre
    alright found one that i didnt already know  emilles moonlight serenade  are they visual kei imo yes if a bit outsider kind of like a gothic version of crossvein
  ive seen the egg god thing in relation to kakeru come up a lot but i dont get it where did it come from
  its not very often you meet someone who listens to vampire rose have you listened to his older band eremia its completely different than what he does now but i really enjoyed them
  jesus that bad lace tho
  i actually havent but i know of them    looks good in the artist photo so whatever their music is good
  heres another elegant band i missed  god damn i love this look
  lacroix desphères
  im already a big fan haha
so anyone else having sibilebashir withdrawls  what the fuck am i supposed to listen to now that theyre gone  any of you in japan do you know where all the sibilebashir bangya went now that the band is gone
  me too anon me too my teenage self would kill to experience something like that a part of me are still fantasizing about it id be happy if i could just see my favourite bands play again
  i got into it all 5 years ago and the feeling has never changed for me
  whats the magic for you whats keeping the spark alive   i went through some old boxes at my moms place and i found my old band shirts its been 10 years since my first concert jfc kill me now
  i want to be like them also nothing speaks to me in terms of art the way the visual kei does
  i feel the same way about the art behind visual kei form the hair to the make up and clothes it just looks amazing when put together correctly it really inspires me to actually try things differently with my looks
    hey it took me 15 years to get here too my way in was a little weird im here because my actual profession is medicine not music but it gives me time and money to do music stuff my in to the vkei was making friends at mikages bar just go to lives make music talk gear and its pretty easy to meet people       the scene has changed a lot in the last 10 years but im still writing music and there are still new bands i find enjoyable even if their antics are not lol i can still listen to old favorites too
  what are your favorite bands from the 2010s other than jupiter of course
    ignore this poll guys just found out you can vote multiple times i accidentally voted for kisou 3 times now  next time ill use strawpoll  sorry
ive never been to a vkei bar before but im kind of interested now are there any you guys suggest and any tips while being there
  if i could go to japan id go to vampire cafe
  forgot pic my bad
  shape shifter disbanded   datura disbanding  sarigia    i just heard 紅ク染マッタ記憶 for the first time live last wednesday and i think after datura falls it quits ill cash in my tickets for their lives instead it was really enjoyable even if those lives are small
  diablo in kabukicho   1500円/hour   staff doesnt speak english but dammit theyll try for you if you need it to sometimes hilarious effect just talk naturally with them they wont bite you most of the staff are bandmen so if you can talk music theyll appreciate it too ask for a whiskey sour and theyll probably ask if you know me lol
  shape shifter  based seth poor guy i wish his band wouldnt have disbanded lets hope for more of him with moi dix mois    they charge per hour is it a host club not the anon who asked about clubs in the first place but would a guy have fun there talking to bandmen or is it a host club for bangya    also dont kazuma from gibkiy and kenzi from antifeminism both have their own bars
  definitely not a host club but their business system is a little similar i suppose you can buy the bar tenders drinks but they dont sit with you or anything like that guys are more than welcome there as long as you like v kei and music honestly it would probably be a nice break for them since a lot of kyabakura girls go there after work too
  that sounds like a great time pretty sure i know who you are so youd better take me when i get to japan 
  ugh sorry that sounded creepy but you know what i meant
  abducted by aliens probably
im moving to nishinomiya for a year does anyone know what the vkei scene in osaka/kobe is like it seems like all the good live houses and bars are in tokyo area   also unrelated but im going to see kamijo live in october does anyone have any tips for attending live shows and/or doing demachi ive never been to one before im just getting into vkei so this is all really exciting and helpful thank you
    haha of course no problem     we were talking about funny live stories earlier in the thread when i went to daturas live back on the 8th 黒い11月 opened for them the guitarist disappeared twice because he broke guitar strings and had to replace them the singer was joking about him like where the fuck did he go and had to stand there attempting to talk for like 5 minutes straight while he was fixing the string it was so dang humid that day because of the typhoon so i know that feeling i go through strings twice as fast here in the summer
  kek
    killed by his cybernetically enhanced evil twin
  im actually an inaka bangya kind of close to kanazawa so i usually travel to osaka for lives   osaka has a lot of a live houses and local vkei bands so i think its second to just the tokyo scene youll definitely have a great time though the only negative is if you like a really small tokyo band they dont really travel outside of tokyo so itll be hard to see them but you can always take a train or bus to tokyo  and desu most live houses arent great unless your seeing bigger bands that go to the good live houses   if youre going to taibans with baby bands all the venues are a bit crap some more than others but it is what it is  for tips i recommend looking at the ask a bangya tumblr its not really active anymore but theres tons of great advice and if you have any other questions you cant find the answer to im sure the anons here can help you  also what bands are you interested in   i could recommend some osaka bands if you want
  great thanks id love to hear about some good osaka bands im still just getting into vkei but i really like malice mizer moi dix mois lareine and kamijos solo stuff i really appreciate it thanks a lot anon
  not that anon but if you wanna hear about more bands like that type ive got a large list
have you read the recent gackt interview cant post link because spam shit  i used to be part of malice mizer but they kicked me out after a year the group disbanded because they could not produce original songs i wrote almost all the songs ever since i joined malice mizer shortly after the band disbanded my best friend who was the drummer suddenly passed away it was a tough time for me but i used all the negative feelings to create something positive i wrote more songs and conceptualized my first concert arena tour mars which was launched in 2000 and requiem et reminiscence a year later its a mix of film concert and theater play    lmao
  gackt has gone absolutely insane even moreso lately and its fascinating to watch desu
    i cant believe hes still in business considering he shows up to his own shows 3 hours late and plays 2 songs and is like bye motherfuckers
im really glad datura is disbanding their music was subpar their numbers especially fai had bad attitudes a lot of the time and their fans are some of the most annoying fans ive met after 15 years of being into vk
  hes been like that for ages though tbh be tapped out a long time ago and just occasionally decides to grace people with the bare minimum amount of effort required to milk them of money
          all of the truth all of the tea keep it coming guys
  i will admit though i thought gackts original sin was a really great single wish hed focus more on music and less on doing crypto scams
  oh for fucks sake not this again theyre perfectly decent people if youre going to pick on fai pick on the fact that he trusted google translate for that tweet hes actually really nice i agree their fans are fucking crazy but thats really true of every goddamn indie band out there right now and i work with a ton of them the smaller the band the nuttier the fans
  cri more theyre still disbanding
  you sound bitter which member rejected you
  someone disliked a band so they must have been rejected by a memember    this shows a lot about your mentality is that how you think in terms of these bands just being dick to hop on im sorry but i look at talent and genuineness of the members and how good their music actually is i feel bad for you being just another mindless skanky bangya
  farthest from wouldnt touch any of them with a ten foot pole but i also dont shit where i eat jumping right to insults doesnt make your case any better
  this is 4chan im sorry you are too sensitive to handle the normal climate here and i didnt jump right into insults unless your poor sensitive feefees took cri more as an insult in which case you really shouldnt be here this website is 18
            and this is precisely why i distance myself from the visual kei fanbase fuckin bangya disappointing
  also keep in mind that datura will basically have no influence on the vkei scene dont get the point in caring so much about that kind of band
  even the small bands have influence on the local scene here id even go so far as to argue that the smaller bands shape the scene the big bands are great i love jupiter and matenrou but their fanbase is stagnant for the most part they arent drawing new people here in japan when i went to mos tour finale a couple weeks ago everyone was at least 25 with quite a lot of much older fans the young bands i work with pull new people into the scene so while datura may not leave a lasting mark musically their fans will probably move on to other bands and stay within the scene although as a guitarist i sincerely hope the guitarists will continue on to some other project
  based közi
  well i do trust your opinion guitaranon
  didnt it get revealed a couple years ago when his taxes were leaked that he had a ghost writer though and the only song he wrote for malice mizer was le ciel although he did do lyrics for some songs   at this point im beginning to wonder if gackt got plastic surgery on his brain too
  gackt has always been insane though even in late 90s/early 2000s interviews he was a complete weirdo i remember seeing a 2005 era interview where they asked him about his hobbies and he went on for like 10 minutes about his giant thong collection
  id love to hear it thanks
  my brain melted bc of his logic didnt tetsu leave because mm started to become more and more popular sure it peaked with gackt but i dont think he was ever the key to success really he has a great voice and is charming but so were klaha and tetsu crazy
  i said even moreso lately acknowledging hes always been insane learn to read
  hes just an egomaniacal retard as  said the only song gackt ever wrote for mm is le ciel okay and regret  he wrote most of the lyrics during his era but some popular gackt songs and especially one of mms most trademark songs ma chérie has lyrics by tetsu despite being gackt who recorded it on studio  i believe tetsu left because of musical differences i guess he wasnt too fond of the whole lets pretend to be european aristocrats aesthetic considering how his next band mega 8 ball was a raprock group that had nothing to do with visual kei but then he formed zigzo with sakura from larc  im actually hoping tetsu will show up at mms concert next month hes still friends with kozi and sakura will also be there
  i remember he said in a more recent interview he left because he wasnt sure he wants the world to know him only from malice mizer iirc he then added because internet happened he feels it was a bit of a wrong decision maybe but i have super untrustworthy memory so this could not be true at all
  wait are you referring to gackt or tetsu now im confused
  sorry tetsu it was in one of these threads so i might try and look it up
    found it translation by some anon    got a part of it translated credit goes to wandering fox from scape forums    interviewer and malice mizer    tetsu oh yeah malice mizer hahaha one of the guys from my part time job was in it hes the kind of guy who cares a lot about his image so i cant say where we worked i was 18 and we used to hang out before that job when he started working on a new band he asked me want to come sing i said yeah sure and that world was created it was fun kind of like a culture fair we made our own plans because it was a completely unknown world to me they wrote the music and i wrote the lyrics and the melodies it was interesting like working a puzzle we members were all good friends each concert was like a culture festival and i thought it was fun but as we got more popular and when we decided on our major debut i thought is this the face i want to show the world on the verge of that debut i ended up quitting but pictures from back then keep popping up on the net hahahaha so i guess the world is seeing that face anyway
  interviewer and rise of the age of the internet  tetsu i didnt think this would happen i might not have wanted to quit hahahaha  interviewer and if you hadnt quit gackt wouldnt have entered into this world  tetsu i guess so i had a feeling that i really couldnt go on though the debut was this huge thing but i was starting to think that the makeup thing was getting more and more shallow speaking to the extreme theres a band called kiss but when they want to return to normal they have to lose their makeup when i looked at the other members of malice mizer they were absolutely just like that hahahaha and i remember thinking im just so different from them i talked about it with the members and it was like you can sell well if youre like this but i think ive got to separate from you guys and i should do it sooner rather than later that was 20 years ago i havent really brought that up in interviews before this might be the first time it probably easier to just do it
who else is hyped for the new shazna album
    i remember this interview  so it seems tetsu leaving was friendly just him wanting to go a different path  i seem to remember i think from that same interview tetsu talking about malice mizer playing on the budokan merveilles and he was working at some restaurant or something and he was like these guys are playing the budokan and im here or something like that kinda sad then again at that point in time i think he was actually with zigzo which was a not so small band i think they also were major at some point so i dunno either zigzo wasnt as big as i think or it was before or after zigzo  that said tetsu never really stopped making music and he always did what he wanted which is cool on its own  i remember some years ago ive read tetsu did a solo acoustic live and he performed one or two malice mizer songs by himself because he was doing various songs from his past bands
  what if tetsu and sakura joined malice mizer for a new album was gonna post this earlier
  id cry tears of joy literally  malice mizer revival would be too good for this timeline though
  whats this
  ill be okay either way because ziz xavat and moi dix mois are all really great i need to get into zigzo too  on the other hand tetsu was probably well definitely imo malice mizers best vocalist
  normie cancer
  on the other hand tetsu was probably well definitely imo malice mizers best vocalist  i agree with you hes the most expressive and emotional one just listen to sadness  hes also the best lyricist by far
  is it a movie it says gackt but i dont see him
  i need to listen to that tape more i mostly just worship memoire
  osaka has a lot of visual kei concerts mainly located in shinsaibashi and umeda as well as vk bars kobe has at least one venue in sannomiya called varit and kyoto has some too     ive slowed down but it was easy to go to two shows a month in kansai if youre living in nishinomiya you may have a hard time catching opening bands after work or even getting home the bus schedule from the stations can suck but hopefully youll be near a larger station well probably run into each other at work or a show so よろしくお願いします
  i definitely agree his lyrics have depth meaning and complex which i think malice mizer came to lack later compared to his work while i enjoy a lot gackts and klahas singing tetsus singing style suits emotionally loaded songs and especially the ones about sanity
gackt hasnt written a single thing in like 10 years im sure he used to but recently nah its super common to use ghost writers here thankfully keeps me in business
  if you like tetsu you ought to listen to the bootleg recordings theyre bad quality but many of the greatest tetsu songs were never recorded in studio the demo tapes are also great sans logique is incredible even if it doesnt even feature vocals  memoire is a masterpiece though i also worship it    gackt and klaha are pretty boring as lyric writers at least im not a fan of gackt and klahas lyrics at least on malice seem to be very influenced by mana as they have the same kind of structure and use of muh darkness engrish as moi dix mois and were pretty different from his lyrics on pride of mind hes still very cheesy when it comes to lyrics but maybe he was the best or most fitting mm vocalist i actually think they peaked with him on bara no saidou and the final singles but tetsu conveyed emotion better  best lyrics by far
alright so i fucked up the last poll but lets try a new one  nominate your most hated bandmen or exbandmen  ill start with some common picks  gackt  miyavi  kisaki  kiwamu  and i dont consider him visual kei or exvisual kei buuut yohio
  fucking yohio
  yohio
  yohio for sure but if we only go with actual bandmen then kisaki
  kamijo obnoxious entitled larping faggot who ruins every band he touches
  as much as i actually love and respect kamijo i literally cannot argue with any of these points
    as much as i love yoshiki he really fucking pisses me off with his inability to finish anything he starts and also monetizing off hides death almost as much as hiroshi does so ill nominate him
  whos hiroshi
  kamijo is trash    at lest you arent delusional
  im not delusional i weigh people on all of their good points and bad points in my opinion kamijo has more good than bad mia on the other hand has many bad points and nothing good other than guitar skills i dont think kamijos perfect
oops accidentally deleted my post  polls back  wwwstrawpollme/16296153
  i just said you arent delusional senpai
  no im the other persom
  ok then you are delusional and also dont know how to spell
  hides brother    kamijo is entitled and annoying but i think worst would have to be either gackt or kisaki from that list kisaki is legit crazy and i feel bad for him
  i weigh people on all of their good points and bad points   i dont think kamijos perfect  delusional  youre the delusional one retarded cunt go back to monochrome heaven
  wow you sure are getting riled up over him pretty pathetic
  we could kind of nominate mana then as well still waiting for new stuff
  thats a stupid reason to nominate someone manas very active
  and you sure cant read apparently
    also considering k died just in the middle of dixs comeback its really unreasonable to demand new content mana has probably had to reconsider his will to continue atleast in some level and getting back to releasing new music/touring is probably very hard atleast he still has other activities going on and he will probably revive moi dix mois when its time     speaking of mana do we stand any change he would appear in kamijos concert in helsinki i would love to see him playing la vie en rose but im pretty sure thats an unreachable dream because neither of them are that spontanious or fun really
  you got defensive saying you werent delusional when that part wasnt even addressed to you and started calling people retarded cunts because they didnt like kamijo you are absolutely sad
  sounds about right for a kamijo fan
  sorry for being dumb this is newbie vkei fan again gackt and yoshiki i totally understand but what have the other bandmen/kamijo done that make them hated watching interviews/videos of kamijo he seems kind of selfabsorbed but isnt that just standard fare for a bandmen   im genuinely curious i cant find much on other vkei websites because theyre all sort of asskissing bandmen and refusing to see their faults
  i called you retarded because you refuse to understand that im not even being defensive of kamijo its just pathetic that you cant comprehend that i weigh people on good and bad traits the world isnt black and white    samefag
  miyavi  involved with shady hollywood people and far left american politics  kisaki  this one should be easy enough for you to research  kiwamu  aggressive personality shits on a lot of good people but personally i respect him as a businessman and musician
  afaik he basically pissed of all members of lareine so they left realized it didnt do that well as a onemanshow and talked few of them into forming new sodmy eventually got the rest of them back to reform lareine for few years makes me wonder why versailles is going through pretty much the same pattern also apparently he managed to piss off kaya too because he no longer uses kamijos label not mention he got into music in the first place because he got into a fight with a tennis club leader and was forced to leave the club apparently the non saying he destroys whatever he touches is not that far off and this is coming from a huge fan that guy seems to be a major dick and diva in private honestly
  you still started getting upset about someone not calling you delusional it makes you look like a crazy fan    wah wah everyone who disagrees with me is a samefag  i really think that at this point you are delusional and thats why you got upset at the word to begin with
  ayrt here honestly i personally dislike mana but i wouldnt nominate him for this hes still active with ks passing mid comeback i can understand why hes taking a break with mdm yoshiki on the other hand has no reason to postpone the x album for nearly a decade to promote a documentary hang out with skrillex and oprah in his free time then waste time with holograms at normie festivals the only reasonable excuse was his and patas health problems but even that was long long after the initial promised album time and not even going into skin and violet uk
  thanks yeah ill check out kisaki sorry for having you spoonfeed me      whoa dang i figured it was something like that seeing as versailles broke up and then the other members made a new band that was pretty much the same thing but without him thanks for the info its kind of disheartening to hear that people i admired are just actual normal shitty people irl but oh well at least his music is good and he writes it himself thats better than a lot of other bandmen
so how about bandomen youve had genuinely good experiences with like getting to talk to them outside of concerts and they were chill
  if you werent being defensive of kamijo why would you get upset about someone saying something to another person makes 0 sense
  because it hurt her feefees that  poor kamijosama was insulted
  looks like it by the post she deleted lmao
            so much bait not even gonna bother
  reeeeeeeeeee hhow dare you insult kamijosama
  you know what the real cancer is calling him kamijosama
  poor kamijosama 
  there is an actual academic consensus among contemporary/youth subculture/japanese culture scholars that yohio killed the interest of japanese contemporary music among swedish youth
  holy shit thats kind of incredible honestly
  yoshiki is active as well i really dont see a difference between what he is doing and what mana is doing but you dont go complain about the other anon who nominated him    i know that k has died while they were still busy with the album and such but even then its been a few years ago already and they do have a new guitarist he has promised an autobiography ages ago which i doubt will even come out he promised to be back to europe which is taking a long time not counting helsinki atm as it is a fashion event and i am pretty sure by now he could have finished an album with ryux but instead he is milking out those deep sanctuary events but thats just how i feel about    i doubt that hebwill go on stage the schedule of the two events overlap so he wouldnt have had time to rehearse but he will probably watch the concert
  yohio is literally swedish mia there are no redeeming qualities but can kind of play guitar
  why does everyone seem to dislike the old meijibray members so much what did they do
  visual kei  you mean a japanised version of new wave right
  anon the my were contemporary movements lol late 70s and early 80s except in japan it didnt die
  their music wasnt good and they attracted the worst type of fan girls also mia has had so much plastic surgery at this point he cant move his face
i saw scarlet valse for the first time in almost 5 years last night kakerus voice improved so much it was such a good live i originally went to see datura of course but im glad i chose that one at the end of the live they played some games ayato and shian had a hamburger eating contest and a drawing contest kakeru is hysterical definitely going to go to some more valse lives from now on     next lives   8/28 sarigia  8/30 datura  9/9 datura last live  9/11 lynch cover band that my friend belongs to
  tell me how sarigia is ive been curious about checking them out
just bought my tickets to see schwarz stein next month i was already going to be in japan for malice mizer/moi dix mois so it seemed like an obvious duh anyone else flying out
  im not going to either show but if you want to go to hang out hit me up
  going to go in order because why not    lantana i had never heard them or of them before i bought tickets to this show i really ended up liking their music it is however very obvious that their music is written for two guitarists and they only have one at the moment ganbatte boys     モンストロ eh typical vkei metal nothing really stood out     breakin holiday not visual kei maybe visual kei adjacent they have in my opinion the best chance of going mainstream out of all of these bands their music style is more normie metal but you know what i really liked it     dexcore also vkei adjacent maybe vkei ish straight death metal if thats your thing youd dig them     ヴィルシーナ actually has a male jouren color me shocked i liked them they had some odd time changes in their music that made it sound more technical     sarigia event sponsor for their new single agartha they opened with that one the vocalist snuck up on everyone by coming from the back he sang the whole song on the floor it was my first time hearing them live hits that sweet spot of heavy metal melodic vocals skilled guitarists and absolutely stupid visual kei style that i really love nastu was really nice to me so i have a good impression of them so far
how do you guys feel about session bands any members/bands worth checking out cover bands are also okay
  thanks for the reviews im really happy to hear sarigia did so well i hope to see them soon now im interested in breakin holiday and dexcore after reading your review
  no problem  the only thing that i wish sarigia did different was how the sell some of their songs they have venue limited cds so im able to buy it but some of their best songs envies 13 etc are only available on a caseless cd at the venue or via their youtube of course they may release an actual album if they get popular enough it seems like a lot of the bands i like just have an endless stream of eps though lol
  well shameless plug   bangya jikken vol 38   shinjuku club science   september 11th     if you like sessions and cover bands youll like the event session events in tokyo are pretty fun but i cant speak about osaka or other areas sorry
  i dont mind session bands but for me it all depends on who is in the band if its a musician i follow i would check them out
daturas last live was really good they played every song lol some twice i had bought the special ticket so i got to chat with the bassist a bit after the show im sure every member legitimately thinks i cant speak japanese at this point even though my name clearly is lol i talk with way more famous band guys everyday with no problem but daturas staff obaasan is always so rude to me it throws me off before i even get to the members at least i said what i wanted in my goodbye notes
  im glad theyre finished shit flash in the pan bando gone rip trash
  is there any band you actually enjoy
okay so i dont want to sound like overreacting fangirl but im just so baffled about this i just have to ask if im just indeed being an idiot so i went to see kamijo and i was in the front row at the exactly same place as 2015 its right in front of meku and my fav place because i really enjoy watching guitar players in 2015 he pointed at kamijo when i was following him because kamijo was in the opposite direction of the stage this time he first did the same thing but after that i noticed him staring right at me multiple times and he always quickly looked away when i noticed it at that point i was sure i was just imagining it but later he nodded and smiled at me when i was really having good time and he always made sure to hit my hand while being on the runaway despite me standing in a place i literally missed every other member doing it it was so odd because i have never seen anyone taking such a contact to the audience and never catched for example kamijo looking somebody spesific my imagination or not it was the best concert so far and kamijo seemed somehow genuinely happy and excited he was so sweet at the photographing session grabbed my hand and pulled me beside him i strongly recommend it if some european anons are still debating wheter to go
  i know some people who have seen him multiple times say that he remembers them and jokes around a bit i do thing he actually cares about his fans
  he probably actually was noticing you my friends will wink at or sometimes gesture to fans they recognize or their jouren and usually they nod at me if they notice me standing farther back alternatively there is a technique of looking just over the shoulders of the people in the front row it makes it seem like youre looking at someone in the first second or third row in the area immediately in front of you so it gives multiple fans the idea that youre giving them attention
  thats adorable his stage presence had improved a ton and i liked how they performed more as a band rather than just playing for kamijo i wish there was a way to thank him for an entertaining evening really looking forward his future projects also he seems like he has the skills to do something on his own too
  obviously he cares about his fans they are the only thing stoking the flames of his massive ego without them his ego would die and thats his life source he would die if they abandoned him
  we are talking about meku not kamijo with kamijo i dont care if he cares about me or not as long as he provides a good show and he did in the past he have had super professional approach and act on but this time it felt like he had some genuine feeling with him too       well i guess he teased me a bit then definitely good way to revoke some interest though im just generally interested but can you say if its easy to regocnize fans i have always thought it would be nearly impossible but i have poor face memory i have always wondered if they really remember those they say they do
  so none of my friends with the exception of my senpai are actually famous lol so when youre talking 5075 fans tops yeah they remember especially if its people that come to every show or at least often i think moderately popular bands recognize some people if they see them many times or if theyve seen them in a situation that isnt normal like at a studio or something
  you could have tried it afterwards or on twitter thats what i did at least
  thats interesting i have always thought they remember just the most outstanding people and just say they remember because its polite and nice however it does make sense they memorise the people most enjoying their work       i thanked kamijo afterwards im afraid digging up mekus twitter and messaging him would seem creepy do they generally appreciate it
  meku has 2100 followers on twitter dming him is absolutely not creepy although you may not get an answer     if anyone has any questions about interacting with bandman go for it ill help you out also first tip if you dont know japanese but want to type something in japanese for the love of yoshiki dont use anata my friends hate when foreign fans do that use xyzsan or sama
  i dont have specific question but any advice is welcome
  depends what you want how to behave at lives how to interact with members without being super autistic i have not achieved this yet with sono from matenrou opera im always a mess where to meet people also willing to do tanuki deep dives on any bands thread if someone wants lol
  of course not you of course might not get a reply or like but support members are often happy to hear you liked their playing at least that is my experience
  i should have word this differently but it is not creepy and my experience is that they generally appreciate it just dont send them like 100 messages and as  said when you want to write something in japanese be sure to do some research and double check what you write and yeah dont expect a reaction
    did it i used english because he seemed to be okayish at it in the live atleast im sure he is better with it than i am with japanese thanks for the encouragement anons i have never had the urge to contact any artist so its all new to me haha this time it was so good i really wanted to say something though
  good im sure he appreciated hearing from you if you have pictures on your twitter he may even connect a name to a face
shameless plug  tomorrow is a great lineup at shinjuku holiday you can still buy tickets even at the door so if you decide to make it last minute its no problem
are nightmare still around im very out of the loop
  i think they are still on hiatus yomi started having problems with his throat so they announced a hiatus in 2016 i havent heard from them since then
  niya just did a collaboration with civarize the members still kind of float around the vkei scene too sessions here and there
best place to sell cds any difference between closet child or pure sound or is there a place i dont know of    i just want these out of my house
  if you live in japan and speak japanese youll get more on mercari or tanuki if you just want to be rid of it bring it to closet child but they may not buy everything
  nobody is going to buy these cds on mercari and i avoid tanuki as much as possible thanks tho
  i recommend pure sound if theyre more obscure/old cds
  i wouldnt be surprised if it was there were a few girls causing trouble asking sexual questions even when it made one of the members uncomfortable and one of the girls got them in a lot of trouble by lying and saying a member stuck a cheki down her trousers and staff werent happy at all datura fans are gross
more info about sonos solo project was released today looks like the support drummer is yuki from versailles im really really curious about this and i love sono more than anything buuut senpai also has a live on the second date and the other date is sold out guess ill have to wait
  why does toshis face look badly photoshopped on lol they fucked up his jaw weird in that photo
  what are you selling
  its too far away to tell what the lace quality is anon    if youre referring to the stiffness thats just starch it helps delicate lace last longer but can be washed out if you prefer your expensive lace to look cheap and disposable
im kind of sad morrigan disbanded theyre not crazy amazing but i liked them and i wish i had gone to their final live
is there any band nowadays that actually is good at following concepts and is actually good music im out of the loop
  what type of music do you like i might be able to recommend a few
i met a guitarist from a pretty popular band they broke up last year the other day usually you can tell what a guy is going to look like without makeup but jfc someone else had to say his name 3 times before i realized who exactly i was talking to i wonder if other people have that experience or if im just not good with faces
we have very active a discord group with lots of fans of 90s/2000s music and allot of us are also into very obscure indie music      would be sweet to see some new fans joining  alternatively we also have a big store with over 100 items for sale in the eu    as a bonus here is manas band before malice mizer that i ripped and uploaded  
  okay anon now you have to tell us who that guitarist was did he look ugly irl that has happened to me before
  i cant say without outing myself because it was a small private gathering lol hes not particularly ugly just like an average looking japanese guy around 40 years old the band was super flashy though and he regularly had bright pink or blue hair and wore heavy makeup
whats the male equivalent of bangya bangbrah why are there so few of us
  ギャ男  gyao     and they are generally odd people so there are very few it depends on the band though for example versailles or matenrou have about 50 male fans normal/smaller visual kei bands maaaybe have 1 male fan
  youre putting the emphasis on the wrong part of that word its bangya not bangya ban is short for band and gya is short for gyaru
  bangyao  im here bro been a while though
matenrou opera new album 2/27 just announced at their live today super fun as always have to wait 2 months to see them again though     its yos birthday so during one of the songs just at the end of his bass solo they all stopped playing and brought out a cake for him the look on his face was priceless he thought he fucked up when they all stopped
  i always love reading your posts matenrouchan
you guys didnt talk about this while i was gone
  who/what is that
  dir en greys new album
  seriously

this floated around japanese twitter a few weeks ago but i thought id post it here because its fun to try to find your favorite band this impressively huge drawing is nearly every visual kei band that has been active within 2018 so some of them have kaisaned already but see if you can find everyone
  im sorry but this is the best description i ever read about him xd thank you to made my day
  very good idea
  youre welcome i really like him lol
  ah thanks for posting this anon i loved the 2017 version cant wait to spend hours staring at this one
why did kyouka really fire chaos  also  releasing a remastered version of an album from 2 years ago  why did he dub over chaos vocals with his own or something
if anyone is interested we have an active growing visual kei discord group with lots of 90s/2000s music fans    we would love to see new people joining as we have a lot of difference in taste  besides just music we also love to see people join interested in cosplay and the style in general  most of our users like to talk about malice mizer p     discord link      we hope to see you soon
  positive or negative talking about malicd mizer i love malice mizer
  who would talk negatively about malice mizer only gackt would do that
  well they did kick him out of the band /sarcasm
    i have always wanted to know what happened between them kyouka is a bit strange
first time i come here my knowledge of vkei is close to none aside from having listened to a fair amount of more known bands ever since i was a young teen  however last year i found diaura by complete chance and was hooked with a single song fastforward to now i love their music and listen to them for hours despite knowing jackshit about the band members and all i just really like the music i was wonderinf if youd have suggestions of bands with a similar type of music thanks in advance
last thread 
stupid mascara question t_t  how do i get it not to clump or get weird at the tips   i have really long eyelashes that rub against my glasses lenses when i blink after max 3 hours the tips get all weird and gunky it happens with almost all mascaras ive tried with the exception of an estee lauder one i dont really like since its black   for aditinonal mascara recs please  give ones that are available in lighter colours ie brown 3
  i learned this trick from wayne goss i wipe off a lot of the product onto a paper towel until it looks like theres nothing on the wand and then go in and wiggle the wand starting at the roots of my lashes and blinking my lashes onto the wand if that makes any sense idk how to explain that lmao then repeat with more coats as needed
  aah so like a sort of dry brushing sounds like it could work  wipe want on paper towel to remove most of the product  auch such a waste i think i will get a cheaper mascara to try this out a few times 
i know its a really basic and stupid question but whatever   for a numer of reasons i havent been using makeup for my whole life save it from few times when i used mascara my skin was always clean and if i had pimples they would disappear in a day i havent been using any creams either just spf50 one because of medical reasons   so now im in point of my live when i probably should learn how to do makeup but its honestly so confusing to me all of the tutorials i find are the ones that tell to put 5 tons of foundation conture and everything else which would make my skin look worse then it normally is   sorry for blogpost but if some gull would be kind enough to spoonfeed me or share some useful links id be really grateful
  just use a primer and some concealer for dark circles if you have them foundation is only needed if youre doing photoshoots or have really textured skin   honestly a full makeup kit for everyday life is just primer concealer a nude eyeshadow palette and your favorite shade of lipstick you can probably get the whole thing for about 30 if you use drugstore products
    fellow good skin anon here honestly full makeup kit can just be mascara and brow color and maybe a lipwear if you need it if you havent done it before youll be amazed by just how far such a little amount of effort goes if youve got good skin anyway theres no reason to start slathering on products which will inherently age your skin with use when just framing the eyes/lips will make you look better than 99 of faces out there
  i claim this thread as basic questions thread  what are some recommanded makeup brands for people with sensitive skin that are also available in eu i have my treatment and routine but when it comes to products to make me feel pretty i am stuck with just lipsticks since they bring no harm ever   any links/bloggers with similar problems are welcomed
  curl yo lashes
im wearing pic related for a halloween party and i want to do some kind of makeup i wouldnt normally do be it cute or more creepy but i cant think of much im kind of vacillating between like a doll/ byojaku or more spooky sunken eyes but im just looking for suggestions/ opinions      if youve got good skin like it sounds like you do the other anons are right in that you can pretty much wear what you want im like you minus some acne scars and all i wear 90 of the time is spf concealer bb cream and eyeliner maybe something on my lips if im feeling particularly cute a lot of it is personal preference so i would say try some drugstore versions of things and see what you like and what suits you for example i know a lot of girls who live and die by their nude eyeshadow palettes but i personally only use mine maybe once a month
  i started wearing makeup before the instagram trend of doneup brows and loads of foundation/contour i stick with the same products i used in high school though now i use higherend versions and better tools brushes i also have clear skin with a very occasional cystic pimple like 3x per year     ill outline my routine/products just to give you an idea of where you might want to start    primer on face im oily and this helps my concealer last all day apply with fingers  conceal my dark undereyes and any redness on my chin or around my nose i use a damp beauty blender  set concealer with a setting powder gently wipe away any excess powder with a soft brush  apply a finishing powder all over my face this is to keep my skin matte throughout the day  blush and maybe highlighter on my cheekbones if i feel like it  set everything with a setting spray    i just wear lip balm because i hate the idea of lipstick fading and having to retouch throughout the day    as far as eyes go you basically just want to make sure you have a good eye shadow primer before going in with any eye shadow the rest colors brands pallets is up to you i recommend watching lots of tutorials to see what looks you might want to recreate on yourself and at a minimum pick up at least 1 packing brush and 1 blending brush
what are good singleshade eyeshadows that i can use for the looks youd see in kera and the other larme magazines please no palettes that have more than 3 shades cause i get irrationally angry at the fact that ill never use all those shades up equally
  what is a good setting spray i feel like mine doesnt do anything my foundation starts oxidizing pretty fast and it doesnt help that i have dry skin even though i moisturize and use marula oil    i also kind of have to skip the finishing powder so my nose and forehead arent flakey i dont expect to be flawless 12hrs but at least last me a good amount of time
i want to grow my hair really long what vitamins should i take keratin prenatal
  setting spray isnt going to keep your foundation from oxidizing its going to do that no matter what so either go a shade up or get a different foundation
  etude house has the colors you are looking for in single shadow pots that are inexpensive larme makeup tutorials sometimes use them
  colourpop
any recommendations for heavy moisturizer creams my skin is drying out and flaking like crazy with the season changing
  biotin and a really good daily vitamin eat healthy too protein and things like bonebroth/gelatin
  thanks anon
when you are so ugly korean beauty products cant even help
  your not alone anon i feel your pain
already tried everything else last resort is to cut out dairy  off dairy for about a month now  still getting zits though i guess maybe smaller/fewer zits  guess i should just kms
can anyone recommend some good masculine products for a basic routine  my new boyfriend is intrigued by my fancy korean skincare and has expressed interest in getting some stuff i dont know if i should just get him the same products i use or try to make it manly for him kek
im pretty young but ive noticed that i have fine lines on my forehead i can pull my bangs back and they kinda minimize is this normal im kinda worried about aging quickly
  take your products  put them in a plain glass jar    men are retarded omg washing your face das gay moisturizer im not a homosexual wwwwwhat if someone thinks i smell nice now
  ive had lines on my forehead since i was 15 im almost 40 now and dont have them anywhere else yet bust still it made me feel like shit at 15 i guess i was just really expressive with my eyebrows i wouldnt worry about it much anon just wear sunscreen and moisturize and take care of your skin
  thanks i do that daily and i was worried that it didnt pay off i noticed that the lines follow my expression too good to know its okay
  lmaooo  this response reminded me of a time my brothers wife asked me why my skin was in better condition than my brothers i told her it was because i washed my face
    on a similar note id get rid of excess mascara at the tube lip    this video might be a little more helpful     
i never post but im just so excited about the circle lenses i bought ive never tried them before so i hope they look good going to spend tomorrow trying different makeup with them
anyone used products from yves rocher i have a coupon i could use either there or for normie clothes
  cosrxklairs and the ordinarynot korean i know have pretty genderneutral packaging i guess if what he thinks is unmanly is the act of taking care of his skinwellwish him luck with his aging signs in a few years
gulls i am a complete retard who cannot into makeup i am planning on doing a makeup heavy cosplay and am looking for suggestions for products a complete newbie can work with to achieve a half decent look specifically what kind of products should i use to achieve the eyes    pic related is the look im trying to accomplish
  cant do makeup  makeup heavy cosplay    why do newbs always get into something and pick the most difficult thing to try their first time     its like the sewing thread they both take practice good luck anon on not fucking up red makeup especially red around the eyes
  products are mostly irrelevant to whether your makeup looks good or not look up dollar store makeup challenge
  talk to your doctor  change your pillowcase daily  and be kind to yourself anon ive been there _
    did anyone else watch this video of a harajuku hair transformation im cringing but at least he looks like hes having a good time with his hair
  just looking at the thumbnail gives me cancer
  the way he talks about harajuku girls makes me cringe im obsessed with harajuku girls theyre the cutest thing ever theyre not dolls creepy
  its not the products its the practice applying makeup is a skill ergo requiring repeated practice      how many rounds of accutane have you done
woke up to emerging zits one on each side of face high cheek  why    how many rounds of accutane have you done  zero i dont trust pharma and im poor    no doctor
last time i booked a microdermabrasion the beautician also removed my blackheads most of which were just sebaceous filaments is this normal procedure after microdermabrasion i would like to do it again but i do not want to undergo the cleaning since im not even sure its beneficial
  go to a fucking doctor stop whining about trying everything when you obviously havent
  im poor and have no health insurance what would a doctor do about it
  honestly seeing a dermatologist was one if the biggest if not the biggest factor that helped improve my skin i mean who would have thought that people who studied for 8 years about bodily complications were more adept at finding solutions than a layman blindly searching the internet
you do you guys think of tatcha is it overpriced or is it worth it
is there a such thing as a mascara that only tints your lashes and doesnt do any of the lengthening or volumizing shit googling lash tint just brings up articles about the dangers of permanent lash tinting blah blah and im not interested in permanently dying my lashes only darkening them for a few hours  i have an upcoming ftm crossplay for a character that has jet black hair and ive colored my eyebrows to match but my lighter colored eyelashes look very odd and regular mascara looks too feminine and my attempts at trying to color my eyelashes with liquid liner arent working either
possibly stupid question sort of skin/body care related how to make vagina smell nice randomly it smells bad and also a few days after my period it smells like leftovers from a butcher shop that got left out too long its supposed to be selfcleaning and i dont douche or use soap or anything so whats going on most of the time it smells pleasant but some days its just not okay any secret asian vagoocare routines
  the vagina has a natural odor due the flora and lactic acid thats just the way it is a coppery smell after your period is normal the vulva should be cleaned gently with water but the vagina is self cleaning douching and soaps will throw off its ph if your discharge is weirdlooking go to your gyno because it could be an infection
  no its just a scent i dont like so it simply cant be helped if i put lavender oil on my panties would that be weird
    some companies make scented pantyliners if thats what youre into cant really say its something i can tell you much about i mean i dont spend a lot of time stark naked huffing my vagoo so eh whatever floats your boat and helps you sleep at night i guess    polite sage for whatever wont be replying btw
  just to add odored panty liners can cause more discharge and they are not recommended to be worn without a real reason      i have panties that transfer moisture from the skin and that helps a lot you should avoid skin tight and unbreathing clothing too also sleep naked and if you dont already do it start washing it twice a day if its still very bad you better see a doctor
whats the best product/technique to cover up redness and acne scars i tried pic related but it doesnt work that well maybe im doing it wrong
  going for a green tinted product is a good start anon depending on the severity and amount of redness you might want to look into a more concentrated color correcting product nyx makes a green concealer if youre looking for a good budget option     for the scarring are you dealing with texture and redness or just hyperpigmentation either way youll probably benefit from a primer but if its texture youre looking to fix youll want a more siliconebased primer though be careful since they can exacerbate redness for some people myself included if its hyperpigmentation you can look into getting a yellowbased primer    overall i prefer to use a yellowbased color correcting primer over my entire face to help combat overall redness and then will spot correct with a green color corrector you want to make sure to blend well and then use a mediumfull coverage foundation on top otherwise you run the risk of the color corrector drawing even more attention to the redness if you prefer less makeup you can just use the yellow based primer and then use a radianceboosting bb cream or sheerer foundation on top youll probably still see some redness but a radiant foundation will help blur it more than a matte foundation
  panties that transfer moisture from the skin  that is a good idea thanks gull i do already sleep naked
i feel like this is a stupid question but how do i wear my foundation  not have it start to get either dry or clumpie my skin is combination  usually with foundation it makes my skin super dry  flakey so i use a moisturizer like primer  that helps a bit but it still doesnt look as soft  nice  not clump up after awhile as i would like it to / also can only use high end foundation bc drug store ones usually irritate my skin  work horribly on me
  accutane for one thing biggest fucking miracle for 15 years of on and off cystic and hormonal acne  did dietary stuff washing pillowcases acids oil cleansing which was awful for me would not recommend nothing but water full ten step korean beauty benzac topical retinoids and antibiotics basically nothing ever touched the cysts until now just gotta figure out how to sort these scars once i finish my course suck it up get rid of your misplaced distrust and save some money for a derm or quit whining about trying everything
  try getting a proper primer from the same brand or change the foundation what are you using anon
  try cutting out milk gluten and heavily reducing sugar in your diet and change your pillow case every night btw the thing that really cleared up my acne was going to the dermatologist and being prescribed antibiotics and a bunch of prescription topicals
  post period grossness is real but the ph change with your period can put some people at risk of bacterial vaginosis usually kinda fishy thin discharge afterwards and those people who are prone to it often get it nearly every month on and off if thats what it is then theres vaginal acidifiers that are designed to help that dont use yoghurt or straight vinegar douches there are proper gels/capsules
  are you exfoliating often and moisturizing daily and nightly i have skin that flakes a ton and i have to exfoliate nearly every day to avoid it you could also be applying your foundation too thick you honestly dont need a whole ton to even out your skin tone     before makeup your routine should be   wash face exfoliate if you need it  apply moisturiser and allow for it to soak in a few minutes  primer  makeup    some people like toners but i dont for dry flakey skin
  drink more water try not to wear synthetic undies so much cotton is bae  research and use a gentle and natural soap i use the wash that comes with my menstrual cup and it is wonderful the vag does its best to deal with the microbes that love its warm and moist environment if you notice a stronger scent on certain days especially if they are days that you eat a lot of artificial sweets you may want to see a doctor about your insulin levels if your bodys digestion of sugars is spotty due to any kind of prediabetic condition the sugars come out in your urine or sweat which bolsters the development of yeast and other sugarloving critters and will throw off your balance down there the natural bacteria and yeast are usually in small amounts and harmonious by keeping each other in checkunless something is wrong that is why taking antibiotics can lead to yeast infections    i personally smell/taste like onions when i have eaten a lot of onions which is pretty funny to me
  1 how oily is your moisturizer different faces need different things the only moisturiser thats ever worked for me has been a notveryoily healthfood store brand   2 make sure you apply moisturizer then wait for it to sink in then apply actual primer then wait 5ish mins for that to settle too then start building on your face real primer is important  3 dab excesss foundation off with a paper towel   4 set the makeup with a brush  powder     srry if u already know this stuff
  i dont know any mascaras that do what youre asking for but check out innisfree skinny mascara the product gives a very light non clumpy look to your lashes    if you cant find innisfree then just look around for a clear lash and maybe mix it with some black eyeshadow idk good luck
  i want to try the primer so badly but i have 2 more bottles of other primers to use up first
  i think the lip ink brand sells a temporary lash tint ive also used the cheapest shittiest elf mascara and it did the same thing except it also flaked
  jill stuart
  my husband uses farmacy and loves their products packaging is simple so that might help
  i honestly love their products i have oily/combo skin depending on the season fine lines and large pores with a good morning and night routine my skin does look brighter and fine lines are less prominent plus the water cream is great as it doesnt add to my natural shine but keeps it at bay
  im aware of their last tint but i cannot find a single review for it and was hoping that at least one other company had this idea i might just bite the bullet and buy it its waterproof after all and i need all my eye makeup to be waterproof because my eyes are pretty watery
  i suggest just getting unscented or more fresh smelling products japanese hada labo products facewash  toner are good and i really recommend the japanese nivea sunscreenits super lightweight is a familiar brand and has neutral packaging personally my skin has never done that well with cosrx but it seems to be great for other people so you could consider that too     maybe after he discovers how much nicer his face looks and feels he can move on to fancier/extra stuff like essences and all that i love the klairs toner and benton has some lotions and essences i used to use the snail bee one that are pretty good
any good recs for moisturizing body lotion for sensitive acneprone skin primarily for use on legs and bikini area ive just been using lotion from bath and body works and while it doesnt give me breakouts or anything i just figure its not good to use i dont know anything about beauty care products outside of the basics    also i should probably just wait to ask my derm but shes kinda useless so ill ask here ive had surgery on my inner groin area and while its healed theres still remnants of a keloid they said it wasnt a true keloid but it feels tough and purple discolouration do you anons think its safe to go back and get brazilians i used to get them all the time before the surgery but now im just worried itll make the scar worse by tugging at it would sugaring be better also brazilians were uncomfortable but managable is sugaring the same or worse pain how about needle electrolysis
i dont have much knowledge when it comes to skin care products but lately ive been trying to take better care of my skin  bought something to improve skin texture as i have large pores some impurities mostly sebaceous fillaments some old scars and flaking so i bought a korean product by some by mi called ahabhapha 30 days miracle serum with centellla whatev that is  is it normal its giving me zits cause i dont have zits very often and now i have loads which is bumming me out  did i chose the wrong product should i wait be patient and keep going or stop using it  i also use etude house baking powder deep cleansing foam and elizavecca hell pore hyaluronic acid serum
/fa told me to come here    the top images are my hair and the other images are the color i want    i naturally have dark brown/black hair which i lightened with 3 peroxide if i put henna on it will i get the orange color i want    can i use hydrogen peroxide on my hair after i put henna on it if it isnt light enough
hey guys i have bought a square headdress does anyone have hairstyle ideas for square headdress thank you sorry for poor english
  dont waste ur money on henna thats just as equal trash to ur hair as actual box hair dye go save urself the stress and go see a professional hair stylist for a good opinion people online cant tell u what ur hair needs to get it where u want it unless theyve seen and felt in in person
  thats just as equal trash to ur hair as actual box hair dye  if you buy shitty henna absolutely       if you have a decent indian grocery nearby buy your henna from there i know lush sells henna bars and ive tried them but didnt really like them as much as the straight powder this is the brand i use and i just mix it with coconut milk and lemon juice and then let it sit in the fridge overnight and i get nothing but compliments on my hair my hair is naturally very dark brown and you can definitely see the red in natural or artificial lightingyou also have to deep condition after using it since it can be drying especially since youve lightened your hair keep in mind that although the colour will fade a bit after a few washes henna will never wash out and if you try to bleach the colour out youll just ruin your hair if you end up not liking the colour youll have to cut it out do your research before committing to it
    dont waste ur money on henna    too late now what    thats just as equal trash to ur hair as actual box hair dye    so it should be judged solely on its color  which i like    go save urself the stress and go see a professional hair stylist for a good opinion    how much would that cost    people online cant tell u what ur hair needs to get it where u want it unless theyve seen and felt in in person    but cant someone at least give me a general yes or no to the question is my hair light enough to get this color    my understanding is that how dark the hair is determines how much color shows up there seems to be a hurdle you have to clear to get warm hair colors    have i cleared this hurdle will i get orange hair from henna or is my hair too dark any hair dye works like this so someone should be at least able to tell me if i can get orange    i actually asked this question a year or so ago and got no responses so i just peroxided it and everything worked out  ive even done my roots once since i did it the first time    i can keep going lighter with the peroxide  i just need to know if im already there
  i have been using henna on my hair for 10 years now i think you should be able to get that color or something fairly similar but you might have to mix it with some cassia or some neutral thing to get it to be that light depending of course on the strength on the henna you buy i have good luck with henna from hennaforhaircom but it can be really strong and with repeated applications i was able to get a really dark cherry/burgundy but my hair is naturally a bit darker    just know that henna doesnt come out either it can and does fade a bit but even bleaching wont remove the red tones so you have to grow it out when you are done    make sure you get 100 henna and not metallic dyes labeled henna
  your local healthfood store should have natural dyes that work better than henna
  most of those natural dyes for red colors contain henna
    my hair is naturally very dark brown and you can definitely see the red in natural or artificial lighting    so you cant tell me if my hair is light enough to get orange i also have very dark brown/black hair naturally but i was surprised by how quickly and easily it lightened to the color i posted    you also have to deep condition after using it since it can be drying especially since youve lightened your hair    years ago i had dry hair but now my hair fine that i barely wash it im well accustomed to dealing with dry hair    keep in mind that although the colour will fade a bit after a few washes henna will never wash out    i like the sound of that honestly    and if you try to bleach the colour out youll just ruin your hair    so since hair developer is just hydrogen peroxide does that mean you cant lighten it with the 3 stuff or just that you cant bleached the color out    if my hair is too dark after putting henna on it can i lighten it with 3 peroxide    if you end up not liking the colour youll have to cut it out do your research before committing to it    well i can define what i dont want  a dark burgundy from my research it seems the orange comes from pure henna and the burgundy comes from mixing henna with indigo or turmeric      anybody have any tips and tricks to achieve a burgundy or cherry cola color with henna ive used henna before but it has always been more orangish  do be aware that henna looks different in different lights just about any application of henna sometimes even a 2step henna and indigo for black hair will shine orange when the afternoon sun hits it if orange is absolutely unacceptable in any light henna is not for you  thank you both im not opposed to orange i wish i could get an orange copper ginger color but my hair is too dark    im 100 sure i want the orange color i do not want a cherry or wine color
  oh ive actually been eyeing that product b/c of all the ads it has on facebook but in general with ahas and bhas exfoliating acids there is usually a period of purging in which all your impurities start to come to the surface these will be in the form of small zits whiteheads etc this is normal and unfortunately can take anywhere from 26 weeksish ymmv to clear up however if you are getting big painful red zits that is not normal and you should stop also you mentioned that you dont get zits very often but if this product is causing zits in places that you normally dont ever get them thats probably a break out and not purging in any case just look up purging vs breaking out and you can check to see what youre having     being patient with these kinds of things usually pays off but if you find that the amount of pimples youre getting isnt worth it or its been 6 weeks and its still getting worse then dont push yourself and just stop hopefully that doesnt happen also check the reviews on the product to see how other people have reacted    have you been using your other products for long if so its probably not those otherwise always patch test each product one by one so that if you get any reactions you know what product is causing it
    you might have to mix it with some cassia or some neutral thing to get it to be that light depending of course on the strength on the henna you buy    so i probably need to peroxide it some more i understand that cassia is used to add blond to light hair  but im not sure if my hair is light enough to be effected by cassia    and with repeated applications i was able to get a really dark cherry/burgundy but my hair is naturally a bit darker    than my hair in the image i peroxided it to get it that light  my hair took the 3 peroxide very well    what would happen if i used henna on the hair i currently have    just know that henna doesnt come out either it can and does fade a bit but even bleaching wont remove the red tones so you have to grow it out when you are done    i like the permanency can peroxide get out the cherry and make it oranger    make sure you get 100 henna and not metallic dyes labeled henna    i bought this            im very interested in any such hair dyes
  you may not get quite as bright as the far left picture  the shade of your hair still looks too dark and too brown remember that henna is pigment so its more like mixing coloured paints than using a box dye bleaching henna is a bad idea and incredibly unpredictable  bleach first then henna just look online for the horror stories if you want to see why      no purging is okay but breakouts are not the deep cleansing foam is quite a harsh cleanser so that with the exfoliant serum may be too much for your skin and making you break out did you start everything new at the same time      are your legs and bikini also sensitive and acne prone or just your face if you have sensitive skin usually its better to look for something unscented and non comedogenic the basic cerave moisturising cream is usually okay for most people   it sounds like you may have a hypertrophic scar rather than a keloid  if the scar is well healed and youre months down the line then you should be fine to be waxed over it
    you may not get quite as bright as the far left picture  the shade of your hair still looks too dark and too brown    but my hair is light enough to get the other two great    bleaching henna is a bad idea and incredibly unpredictable  bleach first then henna just look online for the horror stories if you want to see why    honestly pic related is very close to what i want        hair lightening seems to happen in degrees so i think ill be able to peroxide it only enough to get red not blond    also i successfully peroxided my roots so i bet i can peroxide then henna my roots successfully
  if youre going to just contest everything we say why are you here
    im not contesting anything  i want to be sure what you guys are calling a mistake is what im going to get    if i sound contentious i dont mean to  im asking for confirmation that my hair as it is or after 3 hydrogen peroxide will look orange after i put henna on it    so let me rephrase it    can i get clownorange hair by putting henna on my current hair color or do i need to lighten it more
  ooohhh okay my apologies then if youre wanting clown orange hair youre probably going to want to go a little lighter before you henna while youre lightening though take it slow really you could probably get that colour through bleach alone but getting it through henna would be better for your hair if not a bit more time consuming
  cassia can be used to mix with henna to lessen the red color of henna for instance when i use my henna its a really really really vivid color say i wanted a lighter red stain id mix it with cassia to achieve that    if your hair is really light to begin with you can get clown orange bleaching over henna wont remove the red it just lightens the hair beneath it
  you still need to lighten it more for clown orange and you may be better going for a brand like special effects napalm orange directions or manic panic that has actual clown orange as the intended outcome  henna orange is usually more unpredictable depending on your undertones you may even lift through an orangeblond which is very easy to get to clown with orange dye    regarding bleaching henna as being a bad idea  its the patchiness and the fact you arent guaranteed any specific colour with it rather than it ending up orange bleaching/lifting nonhennaed hair is somewhat more predictable im also presuming you dont want chewinggum hair or a chemical pixie cut which could end up being the result of bleaching twice over henna like the blog you linked
  please dont do that itll fuck with your vaginal ph and cause irritation
    really you could probably get that colour through bleach alone but getting it through henna would be better for your hair if not a bit more time consuming    yeah that was the idea        if your hair is really light to begin with you can get clown orange bleaching over henna wont remove the red it just lightens the hair beneath it    so if put henna on my hair then peroxide it i wont lose any orangered    meaning if i use henna and want it lighter i can just put peroxide on it awesome
    you still need to lighten it more for clown orange    it sounds like i can lighten it if its too dark but i guess ill do another peroxide treatment then henna and finally lighten it more as i want    and you may be better going for a brand like special effects napalm orange directions or manic panic that has actual clown orange as the intended outcome  henna orange is usually more unpredictable    if it werent for the fact that i already bought the henna id consider going that route    ive heard henna can block hair from uptaking artificial dyes would anything stop me from adding artificial dyes later    depending on your undertones you may even lift through an orangeblond which is very easy to get to clown with orange dye    yeah i used hydrogen peroxide for two reasons    1 people warned me that peroxide would make my hair orange  2 i wanted reddishorange hair    i was disappointed when it didnt come out orange at all and in fact looked brownbeigeblond i think that if i peroxide it any more itll turn more blond less red    regarding bleaching henna as being a bad idea  its the patchiness and the fact you arent guaranteed any specific colour with it rather than it ending up orange    patchiness as in pic related but a random combination of browns reds and oranges    bleaching/lifting nonhennaed hair is somewhat more predictable im also presuming you dont want chewinggum hair or a chemical pixie cut which could end up being the result of bleaching twice over henna like the blog you linked    developers are stronger than 3 peroxide  6 or more i went from black/dark brown to that color in two sessions of less than 12 hours
  anon can i ask how did you peroxied your hair i want to do the same just a tone lighter not a bleaching
  yes you can lighten your hair if the henna gets too dark the red stays but the underlayer of hair lightens making it look brighter/lighter if that makes sense like i mentioned i got my hair super dark cherry red/burgundy using only henna eventually i got tired of it and wanted a brighter red and bleached it slowly until i got what i wanted the henna didnt budge at all conversely if you get tired of super orange and want to go darker like in some of the other pictures you posted further applications of henna will darken your hair     i didnt have any issues using any artificial dyes after henna but i only used things like manic panic the red color is always going to be there so if you were to use a green or something its going to turn out more like a swampy brown which is the only issue
  not that anon but when i peroxided my hair i jsut sprayed peroxide through my freshly showered hair making sure it was fully saturated then dried it with a hair dryer i did it every so often making sure to moisturize heavily in between i wanted to be safe and not do it too fast and kill my hair but ive heard of people doing it repeatedly to do it fast
  thank you for the explanation did your hair feel damaged afterwards or dry
  it was a little dry after every time but thats why i took it slow and did a lot of really deep treatments after it didnt feel or look damaged at all after a bit of time
  oh thats amazing thank you very much for you help
    the first time i saturated papertowels with 3 hydrogen peroxide and wrapped my hair then put on a coat with a hood and wore the hood up when the towels dried i resaturated them and placed them back on my hair    the second time i used a toothbrush  i just stuck it in and brushed my roots everywhere i saw black this method worked far better in terms of controlability but im not sure if this would work for allover lightening        yes you can lighten your hair if the henna gets too dark the red stays but the underlayer of hair lightens making it look brighter/lighter if that makes sense  eventually i got tired of it and wanted a brighter red and bleached it slowly until i got what i wanted  i didnt have any issues using any artificial dyes after henna but i only used things like manic panic    awesome all this is exactly what i wanted to know  thank you    good to know i can adjust the resulting color with artificial dyes too    i took new pictures this morning in the dawn light  the sun had a pinkishred tint how does this reflect the result of henna
so i need to get my skin looked at and plan on going to a dermatologist but i have a feeling my acne might be tied to hormonal issues since i also have a problem with facial hair that is getting worse as i get older should i go see a gyno or someone else and if so who first to get that checked out or do dermatologists also deal with hormonal imbalances
  henna looks different depending on the light my hair looks very very bright auburn red in the full sun but almost brown in my room it looks reddish brown in brightcool lights like in an office but more auburn in warm lights
  go to a gp and get bloodwork done theyd check for the hormonal issue
  your hair is fine as is if you use ferias power copper you should get that color i know this because my sister has that bright ginger hair and her original hair color is about the same as yours always do a patch test first
is there any actual benefit to electric/microcurrent facials for acne i remember getting one as part of another facial a few years ago but havent gotten one since
any examples of makeup for ottish sweet lolita i like to incorporate the colours of the coord into me eye makeup but i cant find find a way to do it without looking like someone sugarpill would reposti actually love those lookssuper creativebut not for lolita
  whats the best way to deal with post inflamatory hyperpigmentation/ acne scars  these stupid brown spots make me so insecure desu 
  makeup
  i meant to get rid of them im not covering it up with more bullshit that will clog my pores
  try clinique
  look for products with vitamin c to start with niacinamide can also be helpful for fading scarring      no
  ive been doing dermarolling/microneedling once a week and a bha/aha peel once or twice a week and its lightened up a lot of mine be careful though      nayrt but do you have any recs for vitamin c serums my skin is oily/combo
  sorry for late reply i work too much but i use either lush celestial moisturizer or klairs for moisturizer then for primer i use poreless professional which sometimes i think makes my stink too dry  then for foundation i use too faced born this way in swan  then set w urban decay oil control it took me awhile to even set on these products but i still dont get the results i want for my make up so i think i need to focus on technique a bit more
  please dont do that  well cant argue with those digits     i think ive had that before went away on its own after a few days so that isnt my typical problem i didnt know acidifiers existed thanks    prediabetic  no no my diet is pretty healthy you know i do eat a lot of onions and garlic well shit thanks anon i know asparagus and coffee make my piss reek maybe its something similar happening withwhatever the fuck it is im eating
  i try not to use too much foundation but even soo it tends to get flakey  im scared of exfoliating too often bc sensitive skin but maybe i should more often than i am any exfoliators you recommend for sensitive skin
  no thank you this actually helps a lot i think it might be that my moisturizers are too oily i usually use klairs but i think its too thick for my skin so im switching to lushs celestial one since its not as heavy also do you have any recs for primer i use the poreless professional but fine it too drying for my skin sometimes /
  i use dr wu intensive whitening serum but i think it can be a bit pricey if you dont have handy taiwanese friends who can buy it on special to ship to you i used to use ost vitamin c which was okay but i like the feel of the dr wu one better  i havent tried the ordinarys vitamin c serums but have heard that the 23  ha cream and ascorbyl glucoside solution 12 are the best ones to get from them before they close
  huh i bought a serum that has salicylic acid in it for acne issues and it also has a lot of vitamin c so thats what its for great since my skin is pale that pih fucks me to hell glad to know this stuff will do double duty
anybody have an recs for cream contour for a beginner preferably from sephora
  thanks i didnt know the ordinary was closing i like a lot of their products
  just do a test swatch jfc
anyone else think that african black soap insta girls always shill is a scam it had me like a gross oil slick for weeks after using it
  they arent ceo got kicked out instead
  the benefit primer i dont like that one  i find the ultra siliconey primers are too slick and dont provide a good base for my concealer it always lift and looks splotchy when i try to blend my concealer out    i have been using fenty pro filtr primer for the last month or so and its perfect the texture feels more like a moisturizer at first and it provides a slighty tacky base which makes my concealer and foundation stay in place but its also super easy to blend concealer and foundation on top of it
  like all skin things i think its a ymmv  my skin was ambivalent about african soap but it didnt break me out or make me more oily unlike the oil cleansing method which broke me out like nothing else and took me several months to recover from
have you guys ever gotten a facial is it worth it     i went to the dermatologist to get a tretinoin for my closed comedones and postcystic scarring im on day 3 and its already working great but she did recommend me to start getting facials since im prone to clogged pores     if you have before and after pics you wouldnt mind sharing thatd also be appreciated
  keep your makeup minimal a flattering lip color thats close to natural no pastels or crazy colors some minimal eyeliner and mascara and eyeshadow in either a matte pink or brown and maybe blush
how do i prevent blackheads and my pores from expanding any more than they should   tman
  the size/shape of your pores is genetic they wont shrink they wont grow you can only use methods that will help keep them clean and thus less noticeable     exfoliate weekly or every 23 weeks if you have sensitive or very dry skin use biore pore strips once ever other week if you cant handle the pain of the strips or your skin is sensitive you can use a more gentle porecleaning product like a pore cleanse gel its a gel that dries on your face which you then peel off they work well enough but nothing sucks all the dirt out of your face like the biore strips    dont forget to moisturize after washing your face this will ensure your skin doesnt overproduce sebum to counteract dryness and will keep your pores cleaner for longer
      adding to   just be careful with the biore strips  they do get everything out but the irritation can cause overproduction of sebum or even aggravate acne further chemical exfoliants rather than physical ones tend to be better longterm for blackheads
hey gulls how do i skincare  idk if what i currently do is good enough  in the morning  wash face with cold water  extra virgin coconut oil to moisturize  chapstick with uv protection  30spf sunscreen because fall/winteri go for 40/50 in spring and summer  only apply the latter lightly because im very pale already and i dont wanna get ghostly pale but fuck wrinkles    in the evening  garnier micellar water to remove impurities  castor oil around my eyeslips and where laugh lines are supposed to appear    and i sometimes to an oatmeal face scrubhoney facemask and a charcoal blackhead peel    may i add i rarely ever wear makeuponly when i cosplay am i doing anything wrong or should i add anything
  get wells color charm toner in a red shade you like use that with 20 volume developer and it will look great
  im assuming your main concern is ageing rather than acne and youre looking at a preventative routine    theres a few things you could definitely be doing better  if you have castor oil on your face overnight it is probably worth removing what residue remains in the morning ie using a gentle cleanser rather than plain water coconut oil breaks some people out but if you are finding it good for your skin then theres no particular harm in it  with your sunscreen theres no point applying sunscreen lightly if you want uv protection you need to use the recommended amount or you arent getting proper uv protection since the uva is what contributes most to wrinkles you cant have it both ways and be less pale and also less wrinkly it could be worth using a lower spf with broad uva cover as uvb can contribute slightly to being more tan but be careful of burning i presume you reapply if you go outside again during the day    with your evening routine removing impurities is a marketing term micellar water is just another cleanser it should be fine if you are only removing sunscreen/coconut oil residue  i would advise you to add a moisturizer in on top of the castor oil if you are only spot moisturizing  the whole of your face ages not just the bits that get wrinkles  retinoids are proven to help with fine lines retinol is commonly used in antiageing products but they do increase sun sensitivity and can be more drying so if you were to introduce a retinoid i would also look for a better moisturizer you may wish to look at other actives in the future like vitamin c niacinamide etc depending on what skin issues you have     regarding the extras  physical exfoliation is very rarely necessary skip the scrubs and peels and go for a chemical exfoliant instead  
  keep on keeping on im on week 2 of 01 tretinoin cream and my face looks fantastic be prepared to say goodbye to any fine lines too
  thanks a lot anonim gonna make sure to do that  but yeah aging is my main concern i just dont want to be ghostly pale and look sick  i only apply sunscreen in the morning before leaving for work
  oil especially coconut oil as moisturizer is terrible for your skin get an actual moisturizer
  how so it works great on me desu i never break out plus its a really high quality one
  coconut oil to moisturize
  its not about the quality skin physically cant absorb coconut oil and it actually has 0 health benefits whatsoever might as well as smear your face in lard it makes your skin feel nice temporarily but builds up as nasty residue in your pores over time especially not using a cleanser if theres one thing you have to splurge on your skincare rountine its the moisturizer
  fuuuuck i never knew that and ive been using it since years now because of how its hailed to be so great for your skin
long shot but is there anything i can put on under my eyes to reduce wrinkles i have awful smile lines id like to at least soften as i know i cant make them disappear entirely
  its ok to use as a makeup cleaner if you wash it off but any oil or fat thats solid in room temperature isnt something you want to put on your skin as a rule of thumb i personally like gel moisturizers bc they absorb quickly and make my skin feel firm and supple
    male lurking seagull here    im trying out a bunch of bb/cc redness treatment because i got it bad especially when my face flushes that loreal bb cream is what ive been using for a month and it worked well for a bit but simply isnt cutting it that is its not doing a good job for me but i consider my skin to be especially sensitive and dry like doctors and dermatologists have prescribed me a bunch of shit over the years some of the more helpful stuff was salt scrubs and chlorine baths    i just got all in pic related the vit c serum is causing even more redness because i used too much too fast    i feel like im going to be spending a fortune on bb and cc creams so i should bite a bullet on actual medical grade shit like accutane or claravis
    have you ever been diagnosed with rosacea    do you actually try what the doctors give you for more than three days    bb cream isnt going to help if your skin flakes off what is is getting a good skincare routine that you can stick to for a couple of months introduce things slowly start with a good moisturiser and your way to a gentle cleanser then maybe after a few more steps an aha such as glycolic acid as an example only after you figured out how much moisture your skin needs    and try to stick to what the doctor has given you nothing works until you try it for a while sometimes weeks to months i suspect you have rosacea from  easy flushing  redness i assume its around the cheeks    but again listen to what the health professionals say im just a gull on a croatian diving board
  if bb/cc creams arent doing the trick anymore maybe move up to a foundation and just apply and blend to spots where you get red i have very easily flushed sensitized and hot skin so i empathise skincare is key i spend more money on that than makeup but i wouldnt call it a fortune since everyone should have a skincare routine anyways for actives like vit c its best to introduce them into a routine once a week twice a week etc until everyday use  try an esthetician or medispa if what the doctor/derms suggest dont work    accutane is for severe acne not rosacea look into soolantra instead build up your moisture barrier and pamper the hell out of your skin best of luck dude
  invest in some good probiotics they change the ph and smell of your vagina/breath
  have you ever been diagnosed with rosacea    no just really bad eczema there was a time when i was drinking out of benadryl bottles because it helped take inflammation down somewhat im actually doing that now but only because i was in contact with my cousins dog    do you actually try what the doctors give you for more than three days    yea for a week10 days but it was things mostly related to my immune system ie corticosteroids like predinose my skin clears up so fast but i cant keep taking that kind of medicine it makes you very moody and has a ton of long term effects on your body like weight gain high blood pressure etc those prescription meds were not long term solutions    bb cream isnt going to help if your skin flakes off what is is getting a good skincare routine that you can stick to for a couple of months    i moisturize routinely and intensely so theres been little to no dry skin ive had a skincare routine ever since i was 6 though ive been negligent and had hard times because of it      if bb/cc creams arent doing the trick anymore maybe move up to a foundation and just apply and blend to spots where you get red    i just started using those creams a month ago i think in my case theyre simply not endall solutions for some people my game plan is to maintain soft skin and deal with inflammation not simply cover it up im looking into using vasodilators which i really hope isnt going to end up like corticosteroids    for actives like vit c its best to introduce them into a routine once a week twice a week etc until everyday use    i was using a vit c oil so i thought i was ok but i made huge mistake thanks for the advice though
how do i stop having a red face all the time     also dry skin season started but everything i use makes my face more red
i should specify i dont have acne and dont want to use makeup like the person above  
  what about jojoba oil
anyone tried the new clinique hydrating jelly yet i have oily acne prone skin and am looking for a moisturizer
  clinique hydrating jelly  
  get a proper eye cream i love the shiseido eye serum but you can scour your local tj maxx and find a number of good brands on the cheap
    bumping this question    i heard good things about jojoba oil and im considering investing in pic related for the dry season
does anyone have any good recommendations for a travel beauty case its for cosplay/lolita/travel purposes  im looking to either buy a large one that contains everything makeup skin care and accessories or several smaller ones to make packing/ organizing easier     any advice or horror stories would be appreciated
  thank you for the recommendation also price isnt an issue
    i have
  retinoids and moisturizer      do you find that topical steroids help sometimes short courses 5 days of cream can be enough to get it to settle then maintain it with your intensive moisturizing i presume at least 4x/day if its eczema i havent heard of anyone using vasodilators isnt that a bad idea if redness is already an issue for you surely that will make it worse because youd get more blood flow  more redness also what dietary interventions have you tried       depends why is your face red rosacea eczema lupus sunburn they all have different treatments
i have an eyeliner related problem and ive never been able to figure this out  id like to wear make up for more than just cosplay but i find that when i do by day 2 the outer corners of my eyes become red sore and irritated theyll weep for a few days following too the rest of my eye is fine and doesnt react this way    ive tried different eyeliners different formulas i dont scrub it off when it comes to removal either    any ideas gulls
  only eyeliner that doesnt do this for me is cliniques quickliner the nonwaterproof formulation literally every other eyeliner gives me redness and eye woogies as i call them basically just weird mucusy eye boogers like a cat
  do you find that topical steroids help sometimes short courses 5 days of cream can be enough to get it to settle then maintain it with your intensive moisturizing i presume at least 4x/day if its eczema     topical steroids is part of my standard routine like the very least i can do my intensive moisturizing routine is to take a shower use hydrating salt scrub get out and not dry off but instead slatter on a handful of triamcinolone acetonide in jelly and plain petroleum jelly then i dry off for 2 hours i have to do this every day its ok to miss one but two days without and get rashes that will last for weeks     i havent heard of anyone using vasodilators    fuck me i meant constrictor although vasodilator might actually be better since it would probably help my circulation i notice that my skin is usually drier on the right side of my body my hands are almost always colder than my face which is usually hot to the touch wonder if my problem is mainly circulation and im merely treating the symptoms i dunno though not being a doctor and all    also what dietary interventions have you tried     not much to honest mother tried her best to keep me off sugary stuff im a picky eater so theres a lot i simply dont eat i recently reduced my lactose intake it seems to be helping with acne but i get some pimples when i sleep on a dirty pillow so its probably minimal benefit at best and vastly overridden by other factors
  jojoba oil is for hair and people get acne it really depends on how dry your skin is youll still need moisturizer with it if your skin is dry     also i dont recommend buying industrial sized you may not like it or find something better and be left with too much
  it should be for people who get acne
  i dont think eczema is known to be directly related to circulation the salt scrub sounds like it might be a bit harsh on eczema though are you sure it isnt actually irritating or exacerbating it
    it is harsh but mainly because of how irritated my skin usually is theres a definite improvement when i am using it especially in the winter if it was irritating my skin i would be in a lot of pain not just having redness i buy a lavender salt scrub from whole food but i want to experiment with other brands    im not sure if i can reccomend salt scrubs to anyone with dry red skin because its a dice roll on how anyones skin will react it works well enough to keep my skin moisturized but now i have to deal pale color/discoloration
im asian with very hooded eyes i have the tiniest crease and almost all the makeup tutorials are girls with monolids or double eyelids does anyone know any asian youtubers with hooded eyes for tutorials

    update so i put more hydrogen peroxide on my hair    am i closer to being as light as i need to get orange      bleach on hennaed hair will lighten the shade of red/orange but quite often it cant eliminate all the orange color completely without significant damage for example light brown hair treated with 2 or 3 full hennas lightened only to bright carrot orange after 45 minutes of 40 vol peroxide with bleach activator virtually all the hairs natural color had been lightened away at that point leaving only the henna further bleaching made the hair start to get sticky and dissolve    i want bright carrot orange so does that mean that i can put henna on pic related then peroxide it again if it comes out too dark
anyone have any tips on a lolita hairstyle with hair bowclips my dress has a bow but its not on a headband like most bows
  i think youll be fine i wouldnt peroxide it again straight away as henna can fade a bit/start out darker id give it a few weeks and do some deep conditioning hair masks and oil treatments as those can fade fresh henna
anyone else think makeup/skincare subscription boxes like birchbox are wasteful and a money sink i know they try to tailor to what you specify but i dont understand why anyone would want tons of random samplesize products every month most of which will probably sit barely used when you could just get a sample of something youre actually interested in and then get the fullsize  it just seems like such a bizarre waste of money and fancy packaging
any recommendations for dark circles/eye bags has anyone used any of those tonymolys pandas dream under eye things theyre super cute but i dont know if they actually work
  if its a barrette you could pull the top front of your hair back possibly braid it and have the bow on the back of your head
  yes i think all dumb monthly subscription boxes are a huge waste of money
  i had ipsy for a while but i only recieved samey colors of stuff i didnt want so i cancelled it i like the idea of sample sizes of things but i have a very particular color palette of items i likesoit just didnt work
  ty anon
does anyone know of a good tattoo cover up that doesnt run / rub on clothing too easily  my arm tattoo is too ugly for sweet lolita
sorry if this has been asked already or gets asked a lot but    what moisturizes/routines do you recommend
  eye creams are one of those things that dont really do much when they arent from actual good skincare brands shiseido is relatively expensive but it the eye creams are the best ive used but i also have really bad dark circles   ive heard tomymoly not being good for skincare aromatica has some good eye creams that arent expensive     youre going to have to state your skintype concerns and price range
  so if im getting this right your current routine is  salt scrub   triamcinolone cream or ointment mixed with a moisturizer i presume that your jelly is moisturizer rather than occlusive like the petroleum jelly  layer plain petroleum jelly over the top  let it sit for a couple of hours and air dry i dont quite get what you mean by dry off for 2 hours    i would guess that without the odd day off the steroids your skin is getting pretty thin and may actually be more sensitive leading to more eczema so i would try to miss out the steroids one day a week i was also told not to mix steroids and moisturizer and to leave at least ten minutes between applying them so that they would be able to be absorbed/work separately    in terms of your facial wash if you feel the lavender oil scrub is moisturizing enough as a cleanser then i suppose keep it i personally cant use any physical scrubs even when my skin is completely fine so i always use an emoillent to clean i know it feels nice to get all the gross bits off but the skin underneath is probably even more sensitive and susceptible to flaring up  you could also try like a facial equivalent of a wet wrap using a clean damp cotton sheet mask water and plain moisturizer whatever works for you  im an aveeno person but i know other people find their products too irritating or not moisturizing enough and then slather an occlusive on top after removing your sheet mask basically a variant that may help the moisturizer be more effective and reduce steroid dependence i usually cant stand having the sheet mask on for more than 30 mins and itll start drying out if you leave it too long which defeats the whole point of a wet wrap

just so you gulls know im the retard who spent 400 on a home laser hair removal system because i was getting some stray dark hairs in weird areas including two on my chin i zapped them a few times and they have not grown back so mission accomplished  but my god doing legs is time consuming rest of my body i havent been doing every other week as prescribed so no results just yet the surprise stray hairs appear to be gone for good though yahoo
  thank you ill try looking into shiseido and aromatica i had a feeling that tonymoly is cute and nothing else
  seconding the doctor anon i had awful cystic zits for a literal decade until i started going to a dermatologist i have an appointment about once a month and while i still get cysts occasionally theyre nowhere near as bad as they used to be and while i still struggle with the dysmorphia my old acne made me have its gotten much better and i feel much more confident in my skin now
  youre going to have to state your skintype concerns and price range  pale usually it looks good but i sometimes get these under skin bumps that i believe are acne they arent red or anything like that and dont make a head they go away but i would like to know how to stop them from coming up at all dark circles as well anything that prevents aging price isnt an issue for me but i do appreciate saving money like anyone else would so most bang for the buck is much obliged
  try alcohol activated paint shits expensive but can literally stay on for days
   so if im getting this right your current routine is    yea thats just for my body i also forgot to mention ive been using some witch hazel    i dunno if i should mention the routine for my face or my scalp    in terms of your facial wash if you feel the lavender oil scrub is moisturizing enough as a cleanser then i suppose keep it    its a salt scrub not an oil scrub and i use after an oil cleanser and foaming cleanser     also i generally dont use waterbased moisturizer s since theyre not good enough i used to go through a bottle of cetaphil a week its just better for me to squish the water after a shower within a layer of petroleum jelly
  i would guess that without the odd day off the steroids your skin is getting pretty thin and may actually be more sensitive leading to more eczema so i would try to miss out the steroids one day a week    i believe this was a concern before when i was prescribed protopic but my allergist said the effect of using topical corticosteroids every day was negligible    still i am going to try getting off the steroids once in a while now that youve mentioned it
  is it oily dry or combination     already id look for anything brightening because discolorations will be noticeable on your skin snail creams have gotten really popular so that if you have a hard time picking you could just pick one  i recommend mizon a good sunscreen should already be a must     as for the bumps on your skin i cant say what they are but they might not be acne allergies show up like that too if they really concern you you should check with a dermatologist     for the most part when it comes to korean skincare theyre not too different from one another but personally i avoid cutesy packaging     if those bumps are similar to ones i get which are a type of acne rosehip oil might help you you just cant use it as a moisturizer it fits for antiaging too     you could buy face masks with egg whites or just use a brush and put egg whites on your face just dont add anything not liquid to it     skin maskwise i think atoclassic and mizon are a lot better but peachslices is fine too     you dont really need to buy super expensive skincare since theyre all kind of similar though i am biased for preferring shiseido but thats because they actually do work for undereyes     anything else and id have to know whether your skin is dry oily or combination
  well you can always do home wet wraps as well for your body  maybe try it on one area to see if they work for you the bandages are not that expensive to buy i dont really ever get body eczema except for this one patch on my thigh so have never been too bothered i wasnt suggesting using water based moisturizer alone except for wet wrap  you pretty much always need an occlusive on top of it and my baseline is layering creams  moisturizers but with gaps between them i am amazed your skin tolerates that much cleanser since mine just hates anything thats not either the worlds mildest oil cleanser or literal cleansing creams i basically use sorbolene as soap
whats the best moisturizer/primer for oil control  i havent been wearing any makeup since my skin is finally behaving but i still grease up like a pig after a few hours
  pay someone to do it for you until you get enough common sense to not take on an enormous project youre not willing to research on yourself lmao
  i know they try to tailor to what you specify    ive been with them for what is coming up to two years now mainly because in my experience samples seem to be either nonexistent or wont be given unless you dump a load of money first  which defeats the point of samples however their price is good because i dont really feel the need to spend money on beauty items outside of that and just top up on my old favourites    but one gripe ive had with them is in relation to the quote ive picked out they sure did used to tailor but when they show images of example boxes or if someone shares an image of what theyve had chances are ive had it within the last few months and i think their pool of items is very small i never see anything outside of what i specified or have never gotten    i also keep getting the same types of items as in the same shades of eyeshadows a few months apart which is usually shimmery which i dont like ive also got a small stash of different dry shampoos and micellar water so i dont think they pay attention to what theyve previously given  on the upside i can give away items that i dont like as gifts or save them as stocking stuffers    long story short i think theyre great if youre not really sure of what you want and if you dont to commit to full size but if you know what works for you then theres no point to them
help i need help sos so ive always dealt with oily problematic skin thats not an issue anymore on one hand my skin has never been clearer then this past week on the other hand im going to end up with permanent lines if i dont fix this issue and im quite clueless when it comes to moisturizers for extreme dryness i started work at a new place and its cleaning out a factory theres steam everywhere and really harsh disinfectant flying everywhere its so harsh ive had fine lines form literally overnight its only where the skin creases from me smiling/talking i know its dryness causing it im going to stop showering before going into work and only wash my face after work however does anyone have any suggestion for a moisturizer or anything to protect the skin i used a heavier lotion meant for the body and a lot of the issue seemed to instantly alleviate the moisturizer has petroleum jelly in it should i just buy and start applying aquaphor before work vaseline biooil should i look into pharmaceutical grade petroleum jelly i know nothing about extreme moisturizers help the only other thing i can think of is to also start applying a high spf before work because im almost certain the industrial bug zappers are using a strong uv light given theyre straight up purple but no one at the workplace can give me an answer     please help its only happened this past week so i know its my workplace but i need an arsenal very soon or the damage will be permanent
  adding to this im up for all suggestions different cleanser i can do that what moisturizer let me know im up for mask and serum suggestions too please lay the moisture on me
  i hate the bitch but kat von ds liquid concealer plus whatever powder foundation you have will cover basically any tattoo i use it to cover up my wrist and my sternum tats you do have to layer it on tho

  hairs go through cycles  body areas are 912 months  face is 69 months  so from the time you used the laser start counting  get back to us after the hair cycles through the timeframes and then lets see if its made any lasting difference
  forgot to add those timeframes are only applicable if youve left those areas to grow for several months no plucking waxing or anything otherwise add on an additional 6 months
  sounds like you need barrier more than moisture if you dont usually get dry skin switch to a gentle cleanser eg cerave use a hyaluronic acid containing serum or cream and then slather your barrier layer on top which can be aquaphor if you like if thats not enough add another moisturiser as a second layer  i like aveeno and eucerin but its all going to depend on what your skin likes sleeping packs/masks for when you are at home may also help with hydration the laneige water one is good but i find its more like light hydration than super intense so i often put a barrier cream on again once its soaked in      i have heard good things about mac prep and prime and too faced      just look up genetic hooded eye tutorials youll get more results and a lot of people even if they have a higher crease have a hidden crease so they dont use it in the same way as someone who has a visible high crease
so my tzone is dry af but the rest of my face including the rest of my forehead is super oily i dont have acne or any problem spots but idk what to do i use the ulta hd cream stick from make up forever and it looks so good on most of my skin but the dry spots look so flaky i use a cleansing and moisturizing system from clinique for combination skin i moisturize my whole face but it doesnt seem to help the really dry spots much    any tips for me
anyone used any home remedies to shrink pores lemon juice ice cubes egg whites honey ect let me know what you tried out
  cant change pore size you can only change how noticeable they look
  check the rest of your makeup   also ive noticed people tend to overreact with how oily their face gets its probably certain parts are dry and the oily parts are normal   moisturize the dry parts for dry skin and leave the oilier parts without powder or blotting
  whats youre budget sounds like you could benefit from a primer that has skincare ingredients tatcha silk canvass states that its supposed to be a barrier between your skin and the environment i would try that  it cosmetics makes a cc creme with spf 50
5head  square face  thin hair but plentifull  oily t zone    i dont know if this is the best place to ask but maybe girl conglomerate board can help i need styling advice bonus if in looks cute please and thank you 
what type of lip color ie lipstain lipstick matte color etc looks best with each major substype  i think  gothic matte stain  classic traditional lipstick  sweet lip gloss
  im generalizing and people can make good arguments any other way but i think    gothic black to cherry purple and blue red  classic warm red to coral tones neutral  sweet all sorts of pink and pastel colors with a good bit of sparkle if they want to
  gothic dark/striking lip colours definitely able to get away with more dark unnatural colours oftentimes nudes to grey if going for dead doll look  classic definitely more natural my lips but better shades that spectrum between mauves to corals and some reds  sweet gloss and glitter mostly light pinks but not really unnatural pastel unless its one of those holographic unicorn sparkly ott things      doesnt even mention length of hair or what theyve tried for skin etc  what styling advice do you even want
why do people on the internet say that coconut oil helps against scarring is it true or are they just trying to sell coconut oil
  im honestly willing to try anything ill look into those two the tatcha one looks promising since the ingredient listing looks quite different then a lot of primers ive tried using before i cant use smashbox among others because it breaks me out bad plus since im getting older i likely need to add a little bit of coverage to my routine anyways so ill check out the cc cream thank you
  im way late to this and youve probably already done the cosplay but if anyone ever needs something that functions as a lash tint try infallible black velvet eyeliner by loréal its shit as a normal eyeliner but its amazing as a lash tint i run it over my lower lashes and it never clumps or flakes it just makes them darker its got a flat plane that works well for using like a lash tint pic attached
  its definitely not rosacea lupus eczema or sun burn
im a christmas cake smile lines are worsening despite top notch skincare and all efforts otherwise anyone ever get fillers apparently they injectsomethingto plump the lines back to flat and it needs to be redone about once a year if its only like 200 thats doable     its highly comedogenic so watch out all moisturizer helps prevent scarring not just coconut oil
  but does it smudge  is it waterproof
  do you have kp on your arms or legs
  good luck only needing 200 for fillers unless youre going to some back street alley i got botox to my jaw and forehead/frown and fillers to cheek  nose bridge done in taiwan by a doctor for about 800 but its pretty much that alone for fillers everywhere ive looked at home i needed 15ml just for my cheeks as they were bringing them forward to conceal how puffy my eye bags are and you have to pay per 1ml syringe in most places
any reccs for a good mineral sunscreen
  shiseido for sensitive skin  pretty expensive but also really nice
how soon until you could see the effects of a vitamin c serum on hyperpigmentation  for me like 23 weeks of slathering the stuff all over twice daily  i also noticed a reduction in acne in general but might be attributed to something else
anything to fix neurodermatitis
  a month at least but you arent going to see any results if you arent also using sun protection and moisturizing
  chop the affected area off  but seriously treatment depends on cause to be most effective stop being cheap and see a derm
    eh its not that im being cheap about it but theres only one dermatologist in my town and she has a reputation for being a massive bitch     but if it cant be helped it cant be helped
how many hours of sleep do you get ive been averaging 6 hours a day for 1 year now and it feels like hell
  i need atleast 78 and even after a week of that i need to sleep once like 910 hours i can do 6 or less occasionally though
  68 during the week 1012 on the weekend
  i struggle to function on anything less than 8
i want to make my own moisturizer and facial cleanser with jojoba oil as a base does anyone have a good guide on what oils are save near your eyes and which ones you should and shouldnt combine i know there are millions of guides and recipes online but there are so many and i dont know which ones are trustworthy because i dont know anything about oils yet
  67 on weekdays occasionally a little less 78 on weekends im 30 though and you need less sleep as you get older
  35 during week days  810 at weekends    tfw you have all the workaholic teachers in uni
anyone have experience with kojiesan soap or have recommendations for skin whitening products im asian and ive had a tan for a while but ive been wanting to get paler whiter skin for a while
  start with sunscreen and vitamin c
  i do use sunscreen daily uwu but i had running for fitness class this semester and running outside didnt help get rid of my tan
  only daily you should really be reapplying before you go outside if its been more than 2 hours and also check that youre using enough sunscreen per application and that its one that will actually block enough and stay on when you sweat biore aqua watery gel is notorious for not preventing tans for example
  i also have had a tan for most of my life now idk if the damage is permanent since my tan is so ingrained in my skin now but thanks for the rec and ill def start applying every 2 hours now
what moisturizer/creams do you gulls recommend or have the best review     my skin is normal but can get oily with heavy/bad products ive been using dermae brightening cream until now and its sat well
  my girlfriend wants some nice makeup brushes for christmas  can anybody help me out and recommend a set    im looking at this   would this cover all bases for day to day use
  i use the laneige waterbank moisture cream my skin is oily/combo though
i was looking at buying some urban decay products so i thought i would post some deals i found since it doesnt go on sale all that often us only since thats where i was looking     ultra has the urban decay naked heat palette on sale for 27 today and tomorrow only     and macys online is having 15 off a lot of their beauty stuff including urban decay nordstrom is also price matching macys if you want to buy there instead
  absolutely hell thats more brushes than i use
  just a heads up you only need to reapply for every 2 hours of sun exposure not necessarily ever 2 hours
  i tend towards normal/oily and use mizons hyaluronic ultra suboon cream in the am it feels light and oily skin seems to be a rarer occurrence over the two years of applying it  im not using anything in the pm right now because between my essence and ampoule and the occasional sleeping pack now that its winter waking up with dry skin doesnt happen when i used a pm moisturizer i seemed to have more oily mornings than not
is there a good place to get loose hair for braiding that isnt jumbo kanekalon braids or an excessive amount of human hair for 100    i just need it to extend three small single braids but id prefer something close enough to human hair in quality    or should i just buy some wefts and dismantle them
  just get some human hair wefts and dismantle
  i use shiseido essential energy at night no spf and estee lauder daywear with spf for dry skin in the morning since its winter in the summer ill probably switch back to lancome bienfait multivital for my day cream but i need the extra moisture for the next few months
last thread is saging     ild is nearly upon us whats your comm planning
  so far absolutely nothing
second for glad im not in a comm
an unbelievably horrible ita literally just joined my comm an hour ago and shes already posted an album of fucking ridiculously bad pics of herself in a dress that looks like her grandmas sofa and apparently she lives in just a crack house based on how the backgrounds look  and shes already signed up for the christmas meet  so thats fucking great
  nice picture glad to see real lolita coats instead of shitty north face and other normie shit thrown over a coord
ive been wearing lolita for a couple years but i never had the balls to go to a meetup i dont know what to say when i walk up to the rest of the group what if no one talks to me what if i have to sit alone the whole time etc i just moved to a new city and i really want to get over myself and join the comm here any advice gulls
  you have to have some social skills in general but ive found that people are generally pretty friendly and down to talk if you initiate     if people flat out ignore you then your comm sucks and youre probably better off without
  introduce yourself and connect with them on fb first it really depends on the comm but in mine i can safely tell you that newcomers who are actual lolitas are welcomed with open arms but we have some problems with itas so again depends on the comm  when you get to the actual meetup try striking up some conversations  the fashion is what we have in common so breaking the ice is super easy you have plenty of things to ask and talk about just to make that initial connection if your local comm is super tight knit and you feel like you dont fit in at all then just accept that you just dont click with them and move on itll be sad but you cant really force a connection with people who dont want it if that makes sense i do hope it doesnt happen to you though and from my experience many comms are quite welcoming so just be sure to be polite and friendly and youll do just fine you can do it anon i have faith in you
  whats sad is the grandmas sofa dress was actually the better of the two she posted
  omg right  did you see how shes just in like a fucking hoarders basement
  that plus her facial expression made me so uncomfortable
  holy shit yes like why the fuck is she purposefully doing that ethan from h3h3 face  like shes already got enough eye bags for the whole class but then shes adding earth worm neck into the mix jfc    okay this is weird but i have to say i dont know whos cool in the comm yet and its really nice to talk to someone being real lol
      post pics please
  this is the album cover
  to play with  those expressions  is this a sissy or just in poor taste
  yeah im not completely sure but their profile had something with neko kitty hippy burnout girl in it so im guessing at the very least theres some foul sex in the mix here    also im just noticing that shes wearing a bdsm collar in the first pic
would you attend in workshop meet that could be a bit dirty if youre not careful i have my own workshop with heavy machinery and ive been thinking of having meet here where i would make the most dirty parts beforehand and the comm would do the finishing touches    for an example enamel pins i wont say what im really doing i would do the metal parts with few different designs and in the meet everyone could colour them for their own liking it would take some time after the meet they could come to pick theirs up
  is it though looks like the same hippyesque necklace shes wearing in the other pics    also collars have been part of different subcultures punks goths etc and arent always worn for a fetish reason not sticking up for her just a long time collar wearer and getting sick of it being related to bdsm only
  how can anyone take a pic where they obviously create a double chin for themselves
  sounds like the kind of thing you have to really know your comm in order to pull off successfully you dont want a bunch of teen weebs you barely know poking about   if you know them well enough to do it just ask them personally what they think
  well sometimes bad pics happen but whether or not you upload it is a different thing all together id never upload that lol
  my comm has craft meets once in a while its understood that its okay to show up in normy clothes some still do wear lolita but bring an apron people seem to like them we usually make accessories
  my only concern would be having people i dont know around heavy machinery like its good not to underestimate how dumb people can be i might unplug the machines in case someone leans on them or something    also its weird to bring three people with you to a meet right one i get some people are nervous three and it seems like you should just go hang out with your friends
sf comm is super embarrassing yall get worked up over someone calling out your smelly ass city and resort to bullying and shit flinging as if ny and chicago are like walking in a field full of roses
  sorry you got posted chii go be a disgusting ita elsewhere
  guess telling people to wash their nasty clothes is bullying now
  like we said multiple times  while the city streets are disgusting we dont have any issues of our clothes smelling like urine and feces this isnt a city problem this is a personal hygiene problem
  sf just got the biggest drama monger from wa our condolences try to not let her tear you guys apart
tfw no comm  tfw only 2 people are even slightly active in your comm facebook  tfw too scared to ask them if we could have a meet  ive searched everywhere for comms in nearby cities even an hour away is fine but theres nothing  why even bother
    dont worry literally no one is on her side even the few people who thought sk was being too harsh changed their minds when they saw what cw had actually said cw whined that she doesnt want to be part of the community because of harassment and might go to the occasional brand party but thats all if i had enough guts i would tell her to not let the door hit her ass on the way out but that probably wouldnt be necessary at this point shes essentially shown herself the door and kv will probably ban her if she says anything else offensive
  which is hilarious considering cw would shittalk everybody behind their back and then pretend to be nice and openly declared multiple times that she loved to cause drama what a fucking tool
  im not even that girl but nice try she wasnt rude to anyone in the sf comm thread lura lna and saf were quick to pounce on her on another girls post about the incident good job getting that assmad over a rando using the word stench
    ny girl here thank you making me laugh anon
  same anon same everything close and decently sized is at least two hours away from me
  this isnt a city problem  the smog is so bad that it is akin to smoking 10 cigarettes in a day
  cw complained about urine and grime specifically
  we talking about the person who was posted in the secrets thread right they state city stench
  she should eat and see if the smell goes away
  did you not see her first reply    sorry if it sounds insulting but my dresses smell horrible and im thinking it might be because of the smells of grime and urine
    for real this anon is not joking   the first meet i went too that cw also attended she was straight up talking about how she wrote a bunch of btb secrets about this girl cw went on for while about it and being pretty nasty about it too
      thanks for opinions luckily my comm is rather small and theres no teen weebs so i think it would go well i will ask them would they be interested
can anyone tell me if theres a comm in new orleans area i tried looking for one on fb but cant seem to find anything if so whats it called and whats the comm vibe like thereim heading out that way for a bit come spring and id love to meet some others during my stay
  autism
  here anon no idea why the ops have been slacking on including this lately     its the local comms spreadsheet with links to their chosen social media site nola rufflebutts seems to be the name of the new orleans group currently it makes sense you couldnt find it if you were searching facebook with the term lolitas because they filter that shit now and probably put you on a watch list who knows
  come is a little dead since allot of the veteran members moved out of state or are busy other wise they are pretty chill when they meet up
  im with the anons from ny  big cities smell and the people in them usually smell like the surroundings i went to sf to visit and the smell was awful and i say that as someone who cant smell very well unless the stench is strong
    thank you both for the info
    thats bullshit i also visited sf from ny and didnt notice a stench and dont get me wrong ny is still a gross place in certain areas but the smell doesnt cling not unless youre in a bodega at 3am
  yeah i visit sf once in a while for a few hours and never noticed any bad odor aside from bart and whenever i walk by homeless encampments do you literally go up against a steaming pile of shit and take a whiff anon
  youre fucking filthy and doing something gross to get those smells your clothes then walking through a city no matter how dirty should not have your clothes smelling like shit lol
  why are you so mad l your city reeks end of discussion
  i dont live in a big smelly city where bums can grab at my brand if i walk down the street enjoy your shitty living conditions
  from ny  well of course you couldnt smell it you are immune       yeah you are proving my point the homeless are everywhere there so you always get a whiff of piss coming off some drunk guy im never going back there
another thread lost to bait and stupidity   tldr wash your dresses and move to a cleaner city
your city stinks  no your city stinks  okay lets agree that both of your cities stink  anyone doing anything for ny with their comm
  i know i should be annoyed but i cant keep laughing because anons are getting salty over a stinking city
  stop
    im from la and your city reeks not sorry bout that one smells shouldnt permeate onto the clothes you sound nasty
  yes we all go up to steaming piles and take a whiff we do it all the time every day
cities stink sf stinks nyc stinks london stinks paris really stinks get over it
  yes they stink but does the stench linger on clothing that has to be a personal hygiene issue
    yep nutcracker themed meet
  paris really stinks    nah bro thats cause everyone uses diesel fuel
  ive lived in nyc the past few years and ive never had a problem with my clothes stinking i used to live in a very small town where i also didnt have clothesstinking issues
    what original humor will you be here all week
  that has to be a personal hygiene issue  i only visited but when i did my experience there was that most people smelled bad and the air was not good i never said it was in my clothes the fact that people need to try and draw a distinction is silly because the place does fucking reek all over and its mostly due to the smelly fuckers that live there there is literally a fecal problem in sf and people are trying to act like it wont get on your clothes are you fucking joking
  oh yeah come here and selfpost to defend your extremely bad move thatll work out well
  honestly im with her on this one people are way too sensitive when it comes to the place in which they live i will never understand why it is a source of pride for some
  im not from sf so i dont really care one way or the other who stinks or why but ive rarely seen someone this aggressively committed to carpetbombing their own social life immediately upon moving to a new place it takes dedication
okay look no one who lives in sf thinks it doesnt stink we all know that certain parts of the city smell bad and personally i joke about it all the time the issue is that 1 most people dont have a problem with the smell being retained in our clothes in a way that couldnt be solved by normal cleaning and 2 the girl decided to whine about bullying to rufflechat when she got reasonable answers so yes to the people who are posting about sf and it stinking were aware of this its not a big deal to say that sf smells bad if the smell doesnt come out of your clothes its probably your own bo
  i did go there and i saw two lolitas at tea and crumpet they complimented my coord    this isnt about me though its about how the air conditions in sf are terrible and how there is an actual fecal matter problem in the city       70 mil to clean literal shit off your streets and youre lynching some girl cause she doesnt like the smell in her clothes due to the fucking filth in the air you probably smell bad
  i just read that and holy shit is that city is disgusting
  and 3 people in the sf comm went full retard by bullying the girl on another comm members fb status stop kissing each others asses because youre too prideful over your shitty overpriced city literally no one is saying you personally stink so why are l l and s still so defensive over this you three are the only ones who care this much
  i dont care about that chick actually i just wanted to talk about how i recently went to sf and found that it was true what the headlines are saying there is literal filth in the air
  yeah i mean there were wildfires people lost their homes and lives
  nta but i visit sf for the ap tea party each year and my clothes end up smelling like i just got out of a musty club but yea wildfires
  because those people have absolutely no chill and go full retard all the time especially s
  is there a comm for ne england ive just moved to newcastle the one in my home city was terrible so never bothered but will attempt to mingle if theyre nice here
  where was your home city
  that was in socal far away from sf i went there before all that happened too i understand the smoke transferred and made it worse but even when the smoke wasnt present it was still pig fucking disgusting there with literally feces in the street like i cant stress enough how fucking nasty that is
  sorry anon i thought you were talking about the fires most recently they were actually north of us and pretty close since a few people in this thread mentioned how bad the air quality was as if that was like year round or something but its not normal although it was pretty scary when it was happening and yeah there is feces everywhere idk i guess you just kinda get used to it which sounds weird but it just doesnt faze me anymore         yea i agree they took it too far like the inital thread was okay but i dont think it was necessary to reply multiple times to her rufflechat post at the same time though she seems like a fucking brat and if this is what keeps her from coming to meets im okay with it
  i dont want to give the game away so sw england also tried the manchester comm and that was terrible
  yeah there is feces everywhere idk i guess you just kinda get used to it which sounds weird but it just doesnt faze me anymore  and this chick is getting reemed even though this fact exists wild sf comm sounds awful glad i didnt hang out with anyone while i was there if they all have this typical cgl mindset to pile on while someone is down then fuck that
  chicago here as long as you arent rolling around in the l subway elevators or a dumpster somewhere theres very little chance of smelling like that just because youre downtown maybe something like car exhaust or food but not piss and shit
  the chii defense squad shows us whos on the same social ineptitude level as her lmao thank god most of them dont go to meet/arent even in the comm      if your clothes smelled after attending an indoor tea party that says more about your personal hygiene if anything wash your clothes
  if you think manch is was terrible then please dont bother visiting ne comms we like manch and dont want prissy shits like you causing drama
  sw england  im on their fb and they seem dead/quiet rather than awful what was so bad about them
  that was in socal far away from sf  what is paradise california  anon that fire was heavily covered in the news and is in norcal
  i dont think that anon has ever been to california unfortunately why do people choose this board to larp on
  also chicago also kinda shocked i have never encountered random piles of human poop just laying around in any of my adventures around the city nor have i ever picked up any smells besides maybe food sf sounds fucked up if thats true desu glad i dont live there
  were having a meetup next weekend at the unicorn dessert bar that just opened downtown
loling at the smelly city convos i live in paris and of course it smells like dog shit and cigarettes but no one ive interacted with besides the homeless have smelled bad if your clothes smell like ass after you spend the day out and about its you not the city sorry youre one of the fucks that never washes their brand ever
  this was about 56 years ago now the group has probably died now
  sounds really adorable
  tfw no local unicorn dessert bar
  huh sorry to ask but i remember i went on a trip to paris last year during march and i didnt notice any stench that was too bad are some times of the year just better than others or am i just nose blind
  spill the beans
  not what im hearing in the news again i went before the fires happened
    youre a fucking dumbass lol
    they were all over i listen to podcasts from people who live in la it happened where they live too
is it more about quality or quantity when it comes to ild for you gulls    my comm is having 2 ild meets tomorrow because were are a larger comm with people who need cheaper options everyone is pretty chill about double meet days because of it 1 is pricier with a beautiful venue and amazing spread but not as many are coming 2nd is much cheaper with more people attending but the venue is kind of gross and so is the menu     im going to the cheaper of the 2 because need to be conservative about money for the holidays but im tempted to save up in advance for the nicer one next year im still kind of new to the fashion and im curious about on average what kind of meets end up being more worth it
  i think its definitely about the quality i will always opt to go to the fancy ild meet but last year i didnt get to buy my ticket in time before all the spots were sold out luckily someone organized a micro meet for people who couldnt go and we had a wonderful time i think its fine to have that kind of ild meetup but dont try to create the event page before or at the same time as the official big ild meet as in dont try to compete with the big meet    in your case it sounds like the cheap meet definitely competes hard with the nice one since more people are coming this might lead the organizers of actually good meets to not try so hard and give up which would be a shame
    what comm is this anon kinda sounds cool that theres more than one ild meet going on that way guests can choose what they prefer
  this sounds exactly like my comm but theres also a third more casual later meetup in the evening that doesnt conflict with the other two im like you and im going to the cheaper daytime meet because budget    where you at anon us
  our comm is doing something similar weve got a 2part event a museum visit followed by a fancy high tea at a nice venue museum is under 20 and the tea is about 55 you can do one or both wed all move together to the next event
  quality for sure my money isnt unlimited so i cant afford to travel to the fancy events say like paradiso or rc rip but if its local to me id be willing to spend 60200 for a nice meet     that said i think the most ive ever paid for a meet was just a fancy high tea that was 6090 i forget but if anyone was to plan something extravagant id be willing to spend the above budget on it    i have nothing against those that would opt for a cheaper meet though i completely understand
i feel really bad my comm isnt doing ild because we wanted to have a christmas meet and i was taking time to plan it it would have been the first meet ive planned and i ended up with a job opportunity i cant say no to and i start the same day as the meet ive been planning for the past monthish im going to continue planning it and help make sure it runs smooth from afar but i feel bad dipping out of a prior engagement apparently this job is going to be a big deal so i cant be too bummed my career is kicking off but i really love meeting with my comm and wish i could go enjoy the holidays with them
  congrats on the job opportunity im sure your comm understands and look forward in seeing you again when youre all settled
previous thread      lets have another great thread anons
  going to call it quits for now the cooldown period and captchas sure are something to deal with
  baccano thanks for the great dump anon
  leave /cgl/ for a while because of life  theres a part two of the thread i started  im so glad anons liked it enough to continue with more love seeing threads that got me into cosplaying in the first place
  holy i really want to know how they got this shot its incredible
  what anime/game is this from
  the witcher 3
  thanks anon    what do photographers who do these sorts of shoots look for in a cosplayer or cosplay how would i go about telling a photographer that i want a more indepth shoot like  or  while keeping their time and availability in mind it seems like con photogs are used to bedroom shoots or smaller 1hr on scene shoots with posing but these demand a bit more than that
  youre most likely going to need to coordinate with a photog to do a shoot sometime outside of the con as a location shoot as for what they look for honestly it just depends on the photog    a lot of these pictures demand more than what a cons location can offer and with the nature of how hectic a photogs schedule can get at cons i dont think there would be many who would be willing to put in more than an hours worth of time in a single shoot
  im lucky enough to have a bunch of great photogs as friends so we more or less do regular shootings  pics like that really dont happen in a con environment with some exceptions  like the cons near a big park so youll have to schedule a meet with a photog do some research on fitting locations beforehand and send an email/pm to your photog if he/she would be interested/available its also good to have an assistant or two depending on the cos and location for the shoot maybe ask your friends or perhaps the photog has contacts photogs are also usually happy if you bring props/accessories like rose petals old books fabric for backgrounds and what not since they may not always know your character and what he/she does for example lavi from d grayman a stack of old books or news paper would be fitting for some nice photos as well as fake blood for more actiony stuff
  tfw no photographer friends  im honestly very jealous you can ask your friend if they dont mind driving an hour for this one photo spot but i cant see myself asking that of any old con photographer
  anon just ask if you have the  theyll probably be willing to travel
  doubling down on what anon above said it doesnt hurt to ask   hey i like your work and was wondering if you do location shoots and if so what your pricing for that would be     be thorough and transparent in details   offer to pay for their transportation/gas on top of their regular booking fee  ask if itd be okay to have a friend along for assistance/carrying things around/etc not only will it help you feel more comfortable the photog will feel more comfortable with a third pair of eyes in the situation  be upfront about your planned location so the photog can plan around any expensive equipment they might not want to bring if you dont have a location in mind share the cosplay mood and tone/theme that you want to convey and you can brainstorm a location together
  thanks thats a great response im definitely going to look into that when i feel more confident and have a bit more money to spare    there are a lot of great locations in the southeastern us that ive wanted to shoot at wish we had more castles like they do in europe though
  you should look for photographers who already do these types of shots rather than expecting a photographer with a portfolio full of glamour shots and boudoir to shoot this way
im in love with valentin offners work hopefully i can arrange a shoot with him soon maybe when i do my anastasia ball gown his instagram is valentinpictures
so im going to my local convention down south as max payne and to complete the look i got some fake firearms however with the current climate of today with conventions banning realistic guns i need opinions do these look too realistic should i alter them to make them look fake am i fucked or are they okay they didnt cost more than about twenty bucks so painting over them to make them look more toy like is no problem but i dont want to do it if i dont have to what do you guys think they arent airsoft or cap guns just toys    tldr my local comic con has a ban on realistic looking guns are these too realistic
shameless self bump anything would be greatly appreciated im new to this
my advice to anyone new to a board is to lurk a while before posting and to use the catalogue this is a slow board with a collection of generals dont start threads for yourself you probably killed off something actually worthwhile     theres a help thread theres a stupid questions thread and there might even be a thread for the con you want to attend ctrlf my dude and dont do this again
  you probably killed off something actually worthwhile   someones favorite neglected thread died and was pushed off the edge of the board make a new one and link the previous one its not that hard  i dont understand why anons get upset at a thread getting bumped off most of them on page 10 are at 320 replies or are completely inane thats why theyre on page 10  if ppl want to read dead threads they can just go to     hell now i just want to kill off a page 10 thread
  do not take the ak the pistols should be okay
  i would paint them all a bright color bright colors would work well like blue red green yellow or the classic orange at the very least the ak wooden parts are a little too realistic     you have to understand that cons are completely right with the rule about no realistic guns given that at least half the visitors have brain damage
  im gonna chance it anyways if i have to put it back in my car no big deal    ill give this a go push comes to shove they dont let me take them in such as life  thanks for the thoughts guys sorry for not lurking more and bumping out a thread i mostly stick to basic boards heres hoping itll go well
    i brought a couple of guns like this down to sak without problems and cops in general understand when people bring gun props during con weekend the thing that worries them is when people bring airsoft where there are no such thing as safe
so heres a quick update con is tomorrow and ive started painting like one anon recommended heres where im at so far should i go more or less
  dont go too much more most cons are okay with just the muzzle being bright orange also remove the trigger if you can some also hate moving parts like that
  will do thanks again
  mhm be as cooperative as you can with staff about it too let them check it out demonstrate that its made of plastic but still since its an ak dont be too surprised if you get a staffer who is in a bad mood who tells you to get rid of it i had a friend who nearly had to get rid of his bright blue rubber m4 at an illinois con because the person checking badges was extremely paranoid about gun props
  some cons have a way of peace bonding props usually its just tying swords into scabbards but ive been to places like akon where they peace bond everything i had a pistol with an orange tip and all they wanted to do was inspect it and put a zip tie with a tag around the trigger guard  so maybe if you bring a loose orange zip tie and mention it they may be lenient and do it for you if its not already a policy
  where did you get the toy ak for under 20
  good idea thanks ill be reasonable with the prop checker so heres hoping ill be good to go    a costume shop believe it or not theres a few of them in the city i live in only thing is its a bit on the small side but hey 74u is model right
  this is as far as i feel like going if i should do anymore nows it
  theyre going to confiscate them you arent getting it back if you bring the ak
if you have to ask its probably not a good idea     if your costume can only be identified by you holding a gun its probably not a good costume
  some characters are like that    like say shinya from psycho pass
  this is fine
  stop trying to ruin peoples fun hes fine
  nah nigga i cant think of any other suit wearing anime man who also has poofy spiky hair i have a pretty heavy clump of keychains of him though so i am bias

am gay  end up going to a university in the deep south  meet cute art major in college  wears mori gardens great art generally fun to be around  doki doki  one day she posts on facebook about being a lesbian but deletes it out of fear  develop a crush on her but due to an ed think im too fat and worthless to ask her out  one night at a party we talk about being gay in the south and how we wish we could just be normal or find men we could tolerate enough average southern lesbian self loathing  drop out of college and lose contact with her  actually become fat and worthless  get my shit together and go back to university plus start wearing lolita and generally become more and more confident  daydream about mori x lolita dates or at least having a friend who is into jfash again  when i get back discover shes now calling herself nonbinary and is dating a femboy    i get that with this social climate its easier to not call yourself a lesbian lesbians are evil transphobic terfs in the public eye and its easier to try to ignore your attraction cause i myself dated a guy and tried to fix myself but this just makes me so fucking sad i hate this feeling gulls i was really excited about going back and reconnecting but now i feel kind of stupid
  lesbians are evil transphobic terfs in the public eye  the general public wouldnt even know what a terf is
gem edition   best /cgl/ feels thread ever   nongem edition   full of petty arguments   anyways any other gulls do salsa ive been going to a salsa class under a friends recommendation and it kills me every time

  god this image
  for all you know she legit feels that way and isnt using it as a cover you didnt pursue her when you had the chance time to move on now
gulls i need help im a straight male ive only ever dated girls with long hair but lately ive been feeling attracted to bald anime men should i stop watching anime
  youre not straight then
  anime makes you gay
i work a job where its pretty lonely and im left alone in the office most of the time today was one of those days where i was just straight up left alone due to my only other coworker having an emergency i spent all day shopping for lolita stuff watching makeup tutorials online and i went out and got a bottle of whiskey and drank it all day feels good man
  faggot ass
  probably bait but same  started calling sensei hot as a meme  legitimately starting to find him attractive
  good taste  saitama is a qt
spent way over 1000 on cosplay stuff this year  also spent over 1000 on sex toys this year  i dont have the money to keep both these up so im gonna have to cut back on one of these hobbies but i dont know which to choose
get job can finally afford lolita   finally live alone with a cat and provide for myself  everything feels like dirt   look at me in lolita i feel empty   whenever i buy something it feels pointless   my passion for everything i once thought i loved is gone  only 21 just want to be happy   go to doctor get put on antidepressants they dont help     i dont know how much longer i can go without killing myself i went to the gun range and bought a gun it took like 13 minutes to schedule for me to pick it up for pickup im not sure why im posting here i hope everyone else is still able to enjoy things whenever i heard about people who are sad i always think it helps for them to remember the small things like how tea tastes and how nice thw weather can be and how great you can feel in just the right dress i guess i just cant take my own advice anymore im worthless
  i think you need a change of scenery go on a day trip somewhere
  i agree with the other anon  try to get out of your house it really helps imo  life is hard but please try to take it easy on yourself
  you are not alone anon my puppy died just after i had a really big order in from my ss  i began to associate lolita with my puppy dying it took all the joy out of it and i stopped wearing it i also felt like shit and like i didnt even deserve food for weeks after i got really into lolita in the first place because i was bedridden with a back injury  my parents had died so it took my mind off the bad and cheered me up a tiny bit just enough to not give up hope life throws awful shit at you constantly whether its external or internal that we are born at all and will one day cease to be is pretty crazy  amazing  scary life is hard     i bet you are a lovely person and i am sad you are suffering right now i dont know your family situation but i am proud of you for being so independant and brave and for caring for your cat and i hope you get good in your life anon
  you could also be breaking down now because you are by yourself for the first time you are finally safe  have the freedom to fall apart i had an awful family life very conflicted by losing them be at peace
can crypton future media sue me for creating a religion based around vocaloid i was thinking about renting out a presentation room at the library and inviting weebs from my city    it would be like a con every week
  over 1000 on sex toys this year  anon i dont think thats a normal thing to do      try to get out more and find something that makes you happy before you do anything rash try giving life one more chance life insurance companies have a waiting period of a year in case someone tries to use it to profit a loved one off their own suicide the reason being in a year the chances are overwhelmingly high theyll have changed thier mind because things get better and your cat needs you
cosplay antarcticite todoroki and jack frost  really want to shoot them in the snow   scared of driving in snow since car accident last winter   closest cosplay photographer friend lives 1 hour away     cosplay aside it feels bad in general i work from home and take the bus to classes but im afraid im going to become a hermit this winter i have like 4 friends in town and all my weeb friends live in different parts of the state/different states completely i usually go to them because i live in bumfuck nowhere and theres nothing to do im just so scared i wont be able to see anyone until april or may because of my stupid fear  i thought maybe its something i can get over if i gradually face my fear but i forced myself to drive on slightly snowy roads to the walshart 10 minutes away from my house and it freaked me out i got there got what i need and got home but i puked in the walmart bathroom and still feel like im going to have a heart attack even though ive been home for 30 mins i feel so fucking pathetic
  you like the feeling of having something to look forward to i think itd help curb that unhappy feeling if you started applying arbitrary goals to your off days make a todo list even if the things on it arent all that pressing like rearranging your shelf or color coding your dressing planning new coords etc etc
  i think the process is this   watch gem show   identify with a character deeply   said character loves sensei   ooh i guess i love sensei too now   ballroom is pretty cool too   tfw no bf to make me putty in his hands through sensual tango moves
  nyart but reading your post made me feel a little betterfirst my dad died in june and a month later my cat died i was convinced the universe had it out for me thank you for sharing im sorry that youve gone through so much too
think smoking is absolutely disgusting under regular circumstances cant stand the smell  have a smoking fetish  guess ive got brain problems
  what is even sexy about it im fascinated i just dont understand like whats the thought behind smoking thats a turn on
  if i had any fucking clue id tell you but i honestly have no idea guess it must be a phallic symbolism thing i just love watching women inhale and exhale
a girl in my comm got banned for snapchatting her bare ass isnt that slut shaming
  did she snapchat it to the whole comm or something thats hilarious
  pursed lips eyes closed in a pleasured expression deep inhale/exhale  i can see it
family are starting to ask me for christmas ideas  too awkward to ask for cosplay supplies or prop parts  maybe just ask for gift cards to home improvement or craft stores but id feel really awkward telling my aunt uhhh lemme get an anime wig and several sheets of eva foam
  hahahaha what a ho no one wants to see your fucking ass
  her ass probably didnt pass the standards of a butthole inspection
    i wouldnt call it a fetish but i have a similar thing where i think smoking looks cool in fiction  my best guess is that its atmospheric  the lazy motion of smoke adds a sense of motion to still images and helps punctuate and reinforce other movements theres also something to the deliberate motion  deep breath in deep breath out  as well even though im not a smoker i occasionally catch my dumb ass pantomiming taking a drag to let off some steam    i hate the look smoke and especially smell of cigarettes irl  even vaping annoys me but in movies games and comics i think it looks cool
  embrace it
got invited to a con by a new coworker potential to be really good friends  terrified to go because i have never been to one and cant afford a cosplay in time  feel like i would be a drag while they run around in their cosplays while i am essentially some normie just there
cant get eyeliner to go on straight  tfw gothic lolita
  dress sharply at all times   kek i remember a friend of mine called my bortz cosplay business up above and pleasure down below
  do you like photography anon if you want to engage in the cosplay side of things taking pictures is fun and your friend will appreciate it its also an artistic outlet for you with stuff you can post online later talk with the other cosplayers youve met in general its just a great way of making friends outside of actually being the costumer i do both and i like cosplaying best but it makes me super happy after cons to have stuff to give back to my friends
  when did i post this
  do you like photography anon  never done it before wouldnt know i would feel bad taking awful amateur pics though
mfw canada post told everyone to stop sending mail to canada  guess my whites wont match for winter ild
  this its easier for me to ask for sewing supplies but my family is big on the idea that christmas gifts should be guilty pleasures you could always ask for money instead or a visa gift card
  canada post did what
  that sounds fun id certainly enjoy that more than the dancing people typically do
  the only way youre going to be a drag is if you complain excessively having someone go out of their way to accompany you into a terrirtory that theyre unfamiliar with a really bold and compassionate thing to do it shows youre willing to hang out with them even if its not something youd normally do take some pictures revel in the sights compliment them on their craftsmanship and the work of others trust me the coworker who invited you will be very appreciative
      if you check international mail websites they have indeed suspended shipments to canada for the time being
tfw no lolita gf who likes the same stuff as me  just take away the part that hurts and let the rest remain
  id be happy with a friend who likes the same stuff i do pretending to conform is tiring and boring
  but i have things coming from china omfg
  im in the same boat
  maybe the most /cgl/ thing i ever read  im sure your dildo collection is big enough already
  fuck this gay country
  you dont need a cosplay to go to a con see the sights chat to people who look cool buy stuff in the dealers hall play some games
i am really excited guys another lolita in my comm who also goes to the same college as me asked me to go out to a bar with her this weekend i always want to make friends with everyone and i am so awkward and shy and have a hard time initiating friendship and hangouts outside of my small friends circle so i am really excited to be chilling with more people     im really shy and some people have mistaken it for snooty but really all i want is to be good friends with everyone in my comm and right now my hear is so full of joy im so excited
is there any better feeling than coming home from a long day at a con removing your costume cuddling with your cosplay gf in bed and then doing a foot 69 with her this is the life bros
its snowing and it makes me want to do a photoshoot for my phos cosplay too bad i dont have a qt antarc
  alright what the fuck is a foot 69
  im happy for you anon making more friends is the best i hope it goes well
  based optimist anon who says nothing but positive things and liven up /cgl/
get called a creep for wearing kilts by a girl wearing a yuri and proud shirt
  paying attention to anything said by someone wearing a yuri and proud shirt
    she was so loud though
  bet she was mad because she was mirin you by mistake
    on a positive note a little black girl dragged her dad over so she could have the courage to ask me what the hell i was wearing
    this but also  wearing a kilt
let myself go for years and became a complete fatty  lose 35kg  brand fits unshirred brand fits  order dream dress it arrives and it looks cute on me  maybe i am not too fat to join local comm now
  theyre unironically more comfortable for me i lift and my thighs are uncomfortable in pants i also have issues with room
  some things are more important than comfort
  were you lucky enough to avoid any loose skin im terrified of losing all that weight only to look even worse without clothes
  nyet
    its reversed for me i dont think its sexy but i really like the smell for some reason
  unfortunately no my boobs are kind of a mess that is where i gained and lost the most weight 110cm88cm dd/e cup  but i did it to myself so eh i am hoping to get a lift in the next couple of years everywhere else does not really have loose skin i have done a ton of weight training though so i am not sure if that helped i think it is mostly age and genetics  its worth losing the weight anon i looked bad when i was fat anyway at least now i look good in clothes and ok without i wish you all the luck
friend really wants a collection of lolita items  wont buy them for herself for some reason  has someone create a facebook group and adds other lolita friends to it basically asking people to buy the items for christmas  calls me today and excitedly says she thinks all her friends are going to get the items and she cant wait  no one in the group has responded at all she is nearly thirty i dont really want to buy her stuff and dont like being asked this way  i dont think she would be mad if no one buys stuff but what a weird situation i dont know what she is thinking
  if shes that old shes probably intimidated and thinks its hard or too much to learn have you tried walking her through it friends dont let friends cringeout like that
  nayrt but i love knowing there are other anons who do this too i honestly love the positivity some anons put out and it inspires me to do that same
  how do you legit feel nonbinary that makes no sense    and we were close enough as friends where i could see where her mindset was going if you arent from a closeminded community you probably wouldnt get that feeling but no one has conversations filled with sobbing at 3am about how much they hate being gay and then becomes nonbinary in a year with nothing more to it    and i am moving on its just a lousy feeling
  giving friends christmas presents  do people really do this
  antarc  qt  iim one of those things
  its when you both flip around in the bed and massage each others swollen and blistered convention feet simultaneously
  sounds more wholesome than i expected
how many thong diaper posters are just sissies larping as girls
  i hear/see that sort of stuff around pretty frequently at uni  you dont know all of your friends journey so try not to judge too hard i know it rings alarm bells for you especially when youve been in similar situations when i was in high school i unsuccessfully tried to date guys and focus on their girly aspects but unless youre a mindreader you cant truly know whether shes actually trying to convert herself or if shes genuinely come to some sort of realisation if you put pressure on her/imply you think her being nb is stupid itll make her more fearful of changing her identity back out of fear of proving everybody right
  being nonbinary is stupid and makes a mockery of actual trans people
  but getting judgey about it makes them more entrenched and usually results in them reducing their social group only to people that constantly give them positive reinforcement basically backing them into a corner where they cant stop identifying that way without alienating their new friends
  probably all of them thats why theyre so obsessed with assholes
  all of them same with the butthole inspection shit
  thinking its stupid does not necessarily mean youre being judgmental i think religion is stupid but im able to set that aside and still be friends with people who believe in it its only an issue if they require your validation or either of you view it as a defining personality trait
find out someone who posts on same website as me is going to the same con  meet up with them and their friends irl  initially awkward since we only know online handles/cosplay characters and not each others names  go to karaoke a few weeks later and get to know them better  this has happened twice now  i think this is the only way i know how to make new friends as an adult
  fuck you butthole inspection is funny
  where are u anon id love to go dressed as different mikus every weekend
  its okay we can always fix it with shoop
  i thought it meant you michelangelo pointed like in the creation of adam but with your feet this is better
  i can think of a great many things that feel better than a feeling ive never felt  one of those things is wearing appropriate shoes so my feet dont hurt even after 3 days of constant walking
  youre right anon i think im mostly just hurt but you have a point granted i havent said any of this to her face the most i did was small talk and im not jealous of her femboy bf either hes very cute i think im processing it all but yeah ill try and not be quite so judgmental ill just try and enjoy her company we can still hang out and ill at least have someone to wear jfashion with which ive been waiting years for
got a job about 3 months ago  thought it would be okay  its not  four employees have quit just while ive been there  company only has about 1015 employees in total  management chases everyone out by giving unclear expectations and little compensation  must persevere for the burando  had a meeting with the boss today to set some things straight  made it worse  even extended my 90 day review because i wasnt ready meaning no raise  drove home shaking i was so angry  literally every other job i had i was viewed as a model employee  wtf is wrong with this place  still trying to hang in there for burando    i want the spending money but after today i think my boss is just delusional ive cried so much tonight being so confused as to why they cant seem to value anything i do im a mess and the only thing that comforts is im taking money from this gross company and using it for cute dresses
    from what i hear from other people from similar situations you should leave that place i know its easier said than done especially because new jobs arent found on short notice or might not even be available but i hope things go better for you    also    mid 20s  had a small but workable amount of weeb friends in high school very few normie friends lots of online friends with similar interests  introvert dont make any more on college  some drama going on with my real life friend circle that i ultimately wasnt part of  eventually everyone just ends up splitting off quietly and cutting off contact with one another lose contact with my only rl friends  now i only have online friends and no real means to make more    its not like im anxious or socially retarded or anything but theres absolutely something i dont get every time i talk to a stranger similar interest or not i always hold up the conversation perfectly fine people always talk about making friends at cons but i always went with friends so every casual conversation i had with a stranger chalked up to just that and nothing more    ive never cosplayed and i have no idea how you can suddenly just form a friendship with a stranger you meet for one weekend without seeming like a weirdo or coming off too strongly its not like you have a regular excuse to meet off a single conversation from what i understand    also sucks i cant even really attend cons anymore anyway being mid 20s and lonely sucks i have my online friends and i love them so much but it can only stave off the isolation for so long
  even extended my 90 day review because i wasnt ready meaning no raise  no raise  sounds like they wanted to save some money
  nonbinary doesnt exist similar to how bisexuality doesnt exist
  bisexuality doesnt exist  i genuinely want to hear your reasoning behind this
  but bisexuality does exist terrible analogy
  which kind are you using felt tip is far easier to use than anything else and if you apply it in little strokes to make up the line instead of trying to apply it in a single stroke itll be much easier for you
  if you view this job as transactional youre not going to last long and youll be unhappy find something you enjoy instead of focusing on the money also this company isnt being ran well so its not thats the problem
  some people do i know i do im hunting down some merch for my friends itabag this year gifted her with some brand last year i like doing this its fun but definitely not in the context  mentioned
    i hope you find your own qt gf anon whether she wears mori or not
  lol anon im in exactly the same situation constant stress has made me unable to enjoy anything even in my free time i cry all the time and im this close to offing myself lets get out together
  i can understand that seeing an old friend look like one of those retards from tumblr could be disappointing but try going beyond that not everything that looks bad is actually bad i know she was your friend and everything but are you really sure you can understand her that well youve been separated for a while i wouldnt be so sure
  have you ever seen a bi person yeah exactly makes you think doesnt it
  i see one every time i look in the mirror
used to have a group of friends 10 people including best friend  stopped talking to best friend because she accused another friend of rape false accusation because she has mental health problems  have only 3 people who i talk to regularly now see them maybe once every three or four weeks  honestly i only think one of them really likes me as a friend  i end up spending hundreds to thousands of dollars a month on lolita because of crippling loneliness  i am still depressed    i turned 22 this year and im not an unsocial person im super outgoing but i havent made a new friend in years and i havent dated someone new since was a teenager     the friends that i do have are in their own circles  thats why i cant see them as much i just wish i had a group of friends like i used to
  the only trans people who say nonbinary people dont exist are literally self loathing trans women also pls use google before you speak cuz nonbinary genders have been around forever     also not all lesbians are transphobic in fact the original meaning of lesbian was equivalent to sapphic which literally means liking femmes regardless if youre bi or homosexual     jesus its like you guys need to be spoon fed everything because you magically forget google exists the moment something besides anime or a dress pops up
  cant you just look up a recipe online doubt youll need a whole class to learn how to make salsa its just tomato and shit
  start looking for another job since youre already employed it increases your chance of getting another job because it shows that you can work and that another company saw you as good enough to hire dont stay at the job if it makes you miserable the money isnt worth it when youre to emotionally wrung out to enjoy anything
  haha youre a funny guy anon
its me again    tfw all my friends are telling me to stay away from this girl  im crushing on her extremely hard  shes so cool she listens to me she humours me and i humour her she understands me and gives me very worldly advice which ive never experienced before likes anime games alt fashion cosplay etc we have compatible sexual fantasies  shes like the big sister i never knew i wanted  friends think she is a literal succubus using me for attention and eventually money i have zero intentions of giving her money  tell me i should really cut contact with her and move onto someone more realistic and good for me because  heroin user  used to be an escort  lives on the other side of the world to me  has an unhealthy eternal love for her exboyfriend who abused her  has ptsd from said abuse  is in an open relationship with her current boyfriend  4 years older than me    i dont know what to do i have an obsessive personality and all i want to do is talk to her all day everyday and ask her questions and learn about her i avoid doing that though just because i dont want to freak her out or make her think im just some beta who will lick her feet shes just genuinely the coolest person ive ever talked to and id happily move to her shithole city in the middle of nowhere if it meant being with her    friends think im an idiot for wanting used up/damaged goods and that shes a terrible person but i cant help my feelings towards her
  im gonna need source um please
  there are people with problems everywhere the issue i have here is judging how skewed your evaluation of her personality is from the way you describe her it seems you may have several biases going on there you would have to provide us with more information about her first    we only know what happened to her and not much else
  gabriel dropout
  what else do you want to know i know what it looks like from an objective perspective it looks bad and ive always looked down on people who did any sort of drugs even people who drink too much or smoke and ive looked down on girls who sleep around but for her i literally do not give a shit shes turned my entire perception of these kind of people on its head
  friends think im an idiot for wanting used up/damaged goods  theyd be exacly right how low do your standards have to be/how little do you have going on in your life to be enamored with a damage exprostitute heroin user whos probably disease ridden and takes a different cock every night of the week on the other side of the world no fucking less you really need to stop being a cuck and just forget about her
  i know this feel youre friends are probably right but if youre anything like me youre going to have to find that out in your own time
  sounds like the company is a dog fart mate best be lookin elsewhere
  both past girlfriends i had were prim proper welleducated smart and studious they both ended up being back stabbing manipulators so ive learnt that i cant judge longterm partner worth for shit and may as well just go for the nuclear fun option ive been approached by girls before but i am shy and disinterested in them so i say no so i wouldnt call my standards low    ive just learnt to be more forgiving of someones past since its not indicative of their future or at least i am a very poor judge of character and her personality makes up for almost every perceivable fault she has of which so far there arent many although i understand i am in limerence at the moment i am not exaggerating when i say ive never met any person like her before plus i find her physically attractive which is nice i dont find many people actually attractive i see pretty people but not attractive people
  kill the crush keep the friendship its not that hard    how you cant kill a crush and im obsessive  yes you can with lots of routine physiological selfconditioning it can eventually be done its not easy and it takes time and a buttload of abstract but empiricallyproventowork exercises which is why everyone will tell you its impossible    from the sounds of it she doesnt need a boyfriend she needs someone that will help care for her before she can think about taking on a role like that theyre not strictly separate but theres obvious implications and issues otherwise
  good for you come on anon you can find your dream gf
  ill be honest i just wanted people to tell me fuck your friends follow your dreams she will love you and then give me anecdotes of their ldrs
  its like you live in a fantasy do you go to narnia when you open your closet
  i like the feeling of having a crush its been so long i dont want to get rid of it having my heartbeat faster when i get a message from her smiling like an idiot when were going back and forth getting all flustered thinking about her during the day    its been a long time and i love it
  are you really so brainwashed that you think the concept of nonbinary identity is a historically backed idea do you think femme just means feminine people instead of being a lesbian identity honestly most of them were just male prostitutes youll notice that all of these cultures have heavy gender roles and never let women identify into male cultural roles they just let men participate in traditionally female roles and let other men fuck them
  nashville
using dubious job as a way to start savings and establish credit to move out  buy stuff for job with credit card to get credit  get in the habit of expecting mail  start buying more stuff  savings not as much as id hoped  having to hide job/money from family and most friends  getting stressed from it  want to go on holiday but thatd just be spending more money supposed to go into savings    at this rate ill never move out
  having to hide job/money from family  wtf why
nice first world problems you fucking faggots and nonfaggots
  family thinks im an unemployed student and my job is web entertainment of sorts
  my job is web entertainment  i see at least youre getting paid for that haha cant relate tbhwy sis sorry
  web entertainment of sorts  so youre a camwhore
  web entertainment  its ok you can say cam girl
  yeah the pay isnt bad roughly 1500 a month for maybe 10 hours a week but then if i mention that id have to explain exactly where im getting the 1500 from
  1500  hmm i know a few friends who got 500 for every spoilerg4p/spoiler shoot they did made around 5k/month once  not sure if theres a lesbian version of that probably not
  okay anon i usually dont reply to these sort of posts because theyre ot but you really need to start looking into queer history beyond misinformation you see on facebook and tumblr    even if youre going with the only truscum dont think nonbinary genders are legit idea you have to have seen enough peoples opinions to know that includes trans men as well as trans women and a concept being around forever isnt an argument its legit lots of bad/incorrect ideas have been around forever and the societies that had widespread cultural acceptance of third genders frequently didnt have acceptance of gay and trans people who didnt want to fit into that role the original meaning of lesbian had fuck all to do with liking femmes by which i assume youre including feminine men and frequently included very masculine women
wake up early to monitor snipe bids   nothing happens   decide to sleep in once   lose bid   why must bids end so early in the morning
  if you look at the rate of stock trading throughout each day youll see that most stock exchange traffic occur from late afternoon to early morning with least amount of activity in the midday
    so uh what stuff did you have to buy
  dildos socks slutty outfits you know
  link me to your channel
  lewd i was asking about the electronic devices required to film and upload
  not already having all of that  what are you some sort of prude
  the later replies arent me i mostly bought cosplays to wear and invested in a good webcam
  nah it was an auction for socks
  what cosplays gib link to your channel
  video game and anime no link though
  video game and anime  what ones  no link though  rude
tfw no camgirl lolita gf
  socks stocks whats the difference
  not advertising at every opportunity  its like you dont even want to make money
    i know better than to advertise on an all female board cant get me a sugar momma to take me to japan for btssb shopping if 20 other gulls are gonna swoop in
  ive been in your exact shoes before but i quit before the meeting with the boss happened i had to come in for an unscheduled 11 hours shift after coming back from having all four of my wisdom teeth removed it is not going to get better and i promise that youre going to be unhappy you need to make your exit strategy the money isnt going to be enough to pay for what the job takes away find something better you have to
  web entertainment  1500 for 10 hours of work     fucking nice makes me wish i was a qt grill i make maybe 1/3 or 1/2 that as a male web entertainer  if you can hide it from your family maybe try to save a few hundred dollars from each payout because unfortunately its not a career that lasts forever but other than that you do you
tfw no qt314 cosplay gf  thats how it goes on this bitch of an earth
  cant beat the cock not even a feminine cock
  dont think cocks makes people nonbinary mental problems do that
  oof thats awful anon but im sure youll find yourself a qt gf someday sounds like shes trying really hard to get away from the stigma which is sad really its like all those fujos that become fakebois
  tfw all the qt cosplay and/or lolita gfs have gfs of their own  do straight girls no longer exist or do weeb hobbies just attract a disproportionate number of lesbians
  they exist they just already have bfs lmao
  if that were the case theyd bring up their bf in conversation rather than their gf
  btw it really seems like weeb things attract lesbians for some reason idk why
  and gay dudes and trans things and all sorts of mental illness
  being gay isnt mental
cosplay pants split at the crotch seam slightly due to too much squatting    and i thought they were durable enough to handle it during construction
  i know a way to fix that but ill need pics
  im sorry i wasnt implying it but people constantly say weeb shit attracts ___ one of those things
that feel when no lolita gf    come on i even learned a ton about the hobby where is my lolita gf we can do matching coords with
  pix
gembros i need your help did you buy or make your houseki cosplay if you bought it where is it from     i made my winter uniform but i suck at sewing sleeves so they didnt turn out as puffy as i wanted im thinking about buying one premade but im not sure about chinese sizing because im tall  premade cosplay pants dont always fit because i squat
  your scared of driving on icey roads
my only lolita friend keeps liking most awful coords on cof just because theyre worn by a pretty girl i kinda wanna mock him about it because like what the fuck is that ita shit i also have a gut feeling that he might be a kinkster he seems really creepy sometimes
  i got mine from alibaba  im tall  premade cosplay pants dont always fit because i squat  same problem i had i got a friend of mine to mod it for 50 so that i could actually button the undershirt around my chest i cant sew for shit  the thighhighs still keep slipping off though might get garters for that soon
  your lolita friend is a male of course hes going to be creepy hes probably a sissy and likes the feel of panyhose on his legs while his petti teehee tickles his balls as it swishes around
  go to the nearest reputable tire shop and get yourself some nokian hakkapeliittelliapetakkipiipilitakatta tires its like driving with cheat codes
  its not something she needs to learn shes already a lolita and theres no shopping service or anything involved she just doesnt want to buy it for herself or cant afford it
my great aunt is one of those red hat society ladies and when she found out i was into extravagant fashion she got really excited and asked if i would go with her to a red hat society party  i did because shes sweet and great  turns out the red hat society is literally lolita for old ladies  it was fun and strange like lolita in an alternate grandma dimension  im honestly excited now for like 4050 years from now when lolitas are all old ladies still being catty and showoffy and partying
due to restart counselling soon  dont know how honest to be  genuine autist and dont know social norms    i never told my last counsellor i wore lolita out of fear of her judging me even though its my main hobby and takes up most of my time i cant even begin to explain 4chan to a middleaged woman even though it affects my mental health it seems inappropriate and uncomfortable to talk about porn with a stranger even though it relates to my obsessive behaviours people say youre shooting yourself in the foot if youre not 100 honest with your therapist but isnt avoiding talking about some of this stuff justpolite im so confused
  you sound like you have first hand experience with pettis and ball swishing
  but isnt avoiding talking about some of this stuff justpolite  when you are talking to a friend or a random person sure it can be more polite to skip some things and not to cry out on their shoulder but you arent doing that you are talking to a skilled individual that dont skip anything as major as your favourite hobby or a place you spend a lot of time on its for your best they are getting paid to listen to that shit and yours probably wasnt the worst they encountered dont fear about their wellbeing but about yours
  wwhat porn
  like  said youre paying this person to listen to and help you with things your friends cant/wont holding things back is only going to make her job and your life harder just lay it all out and take comfort in knowing that at best shell help you with your problems and at worst you give her new traumas of her own to talk about with her therapist who will then talk about it with his/her therapist and so on thus helping to keep several dozen therapists employed
  garters for that soon  anon why there are options like sock glue fashion tape wearing tights under dont go for something that destroys the visual
  do there even exist sock glue and fashion tape strong enough to keep my bulging quads from pushing the thighhighs down i have the opposite problem than the one i think you think i have sweetie
    so you lost all that weight only to still have cow tits kek
  on what planet
  the hell do you want a pic of a dude in a kilt for
  have you tried sock glue is some strong shit alternatively get bigger socks ya fool
  alright gull you win this time ill try the glue
  to masturbate to
  we all have fetishes lets not judge
  science
      last time i posted a picture there were discussions about me wearing pink floral socks and then people demanded i wore a sports thong underwear i aint fallen for that shit again
  you know sometimes you just have to try out different kinds of anti depressants it can take a few tries to find the right one for you
i dont know if this fits here but i wanted to just blow steam here i got into a minor argument with some rando on fb about lolita being a fashion based off dressing like a child and i just dont understand this mindset becausewhat fancy children do you know i know that sweet can look really ageplayy and childish sometimes but like theres few lolita items that resemble childrens clothing at most things look like porcelain dolls    i know theres no use in getting mad over this but reeeeeeee normies
i dunno how to enjoy cons anymore all i can think is    i can find this shitty merch online for cheaper  i dont want to ask cosplayers for photos its not like im gonna look at them anyways also theyre probably busy  these panels just talk about shit i already know  so i just paid a weekend pass to buy nothing and not enjoy anything really i wish i had some cosplay friends or something
  sometimes i think some people just outgrow cons i was starting to feel the same way but one thing that helped me have more fun was start doing panels myself or helping friends out with theirs as for the pics i definitely dont take as many as i used to but i also havent kept up with a lot of the recent anime that said i still like to take them share them on social media if youre not a social media kinda person even just taking photos to share on con threads on cgl or in con fb groups may be something that could make it worth it for you i also never buy merch at cons either but i still enjoy buying stuff in the aa    but yeah anon youre not alone in your feelings i know plenty of folks who have stopped attending cons because they felt like theyve outgrown them or the cons have outgrown them
    i guess youre right i just feel unsure because its not even a proper licensed therapist so i dont know how much theyre prepared for and its not like im directly paying its some sort of universitysponsored counselling thing not a psychiatrist      it was like an almost selfharm sort of exposure therapy thing back when i was trying to repress my sexuality really hard 23 years ago usually cant stand stuff with opposite sex in it went through a phase where i was depressed to the point of basically not feeling emotions took advantage of lack of outright disgust to watch hours of straight/gayshit cry because i feel disgusting and still will never be pure cishet etc very fuckedup and unhealthy in hindsight
  you must be me  go to same con every year  only buy one or two things from one table in the dealer hall exclusively  only go to 18 panels because boobs and cursing  spend 90 of the weekend wandering around peoplewatching and smoking  make a couple friends for the weekend so i can convince myself its all worth it  at this point i basically go because its part of the routine and i really like routines      its not even a proper licensed therapist so i dont know how much theyre prepared for and its not like im directly paying its some sort of universitysponsored counselling thing not a psychiatrist  oh fuck well you can forget about getting actual help then i still think you should just let it fly and see what happens
  i think youve got it with the dolls dolls  childrens toys so fashion that looks like something a doll would wear  childrens fashion when i was a child i remember receiving one of those american girl dolls thats supposed to look like you with similar clothes and everything wanting to have a matching outfit with your doll that might contribute
  sports thong underwear  what like a jockstrap that stuff is comfy bro you should look into it
  sorry i ment mens bikini undies fruit of the loom and hanes make them    also no no
  the one with the rear open is the jockstrap youre not talking about that are you haha lets just forget about this convo
  smells like a jelly fatty up in dis bitch 88cm is sizable but hardly cowtits and cup size doesnt necessarily mean huge boobs
this type of thing gets posted all the time but im at a loss on how to connect with people ive met at cons i feel im really behind on media sites i made a tumblr back when that was what everyone used but then asking for peoples tumblrs i would get told they only use twitter then moved to twitter and everyone is on instagram made an instagram and still cant seem to connect with anyone   ive been going out of my way to try and chat with people and make friends but nothing seems to stick what really sucks is my local con has been going really downhill and its not worth it to attend just to look for people who probably wont be interested in being my friend   ive moved from cosplaying niche things and mangaonly characters/series to more popular ones and it seems to have increased the amount of people willing to talk to me but after the small talk if i can work up the confidence to ask for their info i cant seem to stay connected with them just dropped convos or simple f4f i am very aware of how i speak and act at all times so if i say something weird or awkward i will just disengage but most of the time it seems to go well until this online part im a touch jealous of one of my irl friends because every time we go to a con together she runs off to meet a million of her online friends while i dont have any to meet my very small irl friend group is great but i wish i could make more friends you know  i really miss some of my online friends from the lj days and want something like that again im in my mid20s and still love cons and cosplaying but it feels so hard to make friends my age or make younger friends without coming off as a creep
   anon you are one weird mother fucker
  most people i know who have been going to constantly for awhile find switching it up and doing different things makes the con more enjoyable i know a few people who actually enjoy volunteering theres also running panels and probably other stuff you can do
  go less frequently or something
  nah just gay
  ive been going to cons since 02 been going to them even while i was in service and still dooo to this day however i got where youre coming from and theres a method you can follow that allows me to still enjoy them    go purely to people watch find a comfy chair and watch the side shows go by  choose one or two serious panels to enjoy  dont take the con seriously at all  find the cosplayers that really deserve the attention and chat them up for a few minutes then head on your way most of them dont really want their picture taken anyway  if possible go with friends    doing this im still able to greatly enjoy cons
  im a guy anon
  yeah i know
  dont listen to the sock glue anons absolutely cosplay bort in garters
my friend just got out of jail he hasnt been to a con since mtac 2012 should i invite him to a con
  thanks for the offer but i think ill be alright just did a ton of backstitches by hand cuz i dont have my machine on me    on some real jury rigging shit
  sure if his release conditions will allow him to do so i dont see why not unless he has restrictions
  post pink and lavender coord anon
  dont worry anon i was already planning on getting the garters   people already assume i do escort work with the thighhighs lmao
  dont you tho
  no i dont get paid
  people watching sounds nice though i wish i could also converse with more people at conventions its the only place to meet weebs in the wild and most of the time theyre all busy running around the con rather than wanting to stop and talk
  good idea no sense in ripping out your leg hair with tape or glue    also better post some mf pics
  ott sweet gives the fashion a bad reputation
  leg hair  i shave my legs every week hun just fyi  pics will come as soon as the garters come though with canada post blocking international packages from coming in i dont know how long thatd take
  how long does it take you to shave your legs
  do you shave that often for cosplay or personal preference either way props to you that shit takes forever  hope canada post gets their shit together that entire situation sounds awful
  i use shaving powder takes around 2030 mins after showering to destroy all hair on my lower body for upper body i just use a buzzer    for cosplay or personal preference  both not a big fan of body hair on myself tbqhwy  that entire situation sounds awful  no kidding i have things still intransit from a month ago honestly dont know whats gonna happen with them
  stop wait a minute ow      for real though most weebs are degenerate scum and arent worth your time this is why you people watch its very easy to pick up on who wants to talk or who else is looking for someone to talk to you find most of these people at other booths or panels and usually just striking up conversation about the subject or their cosplay can instantly energize a conversation even with my size and outward appearance i have been able to make friends and conversation with people whos foreheads barely reach my ribcage theres an odd science to it
we 4channel now i guess
mfw i realize ive neen cosplaying houseki for 3 months and havent shaved my legs once   oops   i dont usually bother because it takes 45 minutes and i slice the fuck out of my ankles  the area behind my knees but i just do it so i can be a smooth pretty gem
  i need to just do it
  shaving legs takes 45 minutes  how unless youre using an extremely dull worn out razor in that case just buy a better one for a few dollars it shouldnt take more than five minutes or so to shave
  not that anon but you must be joking    even with fresh brand new razor blades it takes at least a quarter of an hour to get all the hair on just my face and legs have so much more surface area to cover than that
  i only shave my ankles to strap them for sport and that takes well over five minutes per ankle
  next time something like that happens just show them pictures of gothic or classic coords i get why people would view sweet as childish if they think that themes children like  dressing like a child but i dont see how anyone could think vm or moitie look anything like childrens clothes
tfw no bf  recently started panicking about wanting to get married asap  /lit/   past 3 books have all featured marriage proposals as major plot devices its classic /lit/ not chickfiction though just disclaimer  think how nice it would be if people you date just propose marriage up front instead of needing this multiyear dating waste of time   even if i had a bf he may actually waste years of my life and then duck out of marrying me leaving me an old expired cake and still single  whats the point my god fuck modern life tfw no upfront nofuss proposal with an easy yes/no tfw no bf tfw no husband tfw hate dating just want cuddles and someone to split rent with tfw no boyfriend to suck my milkers
                sorta glad to hear im not the only one in the situation    im not purely there for the money the money is actually pretty bad which is why i was counting on that review and a raise i got paid more when i worked in retail but its a job that involves my first degree so i thought it would be a good place to be its not soulcrushing work its just soulcrushing management in fact on friday before any of this happened i thought i was finally doing really well    i wanted to at least be there for 6 months because thats the magic number for not looking like you quit too soon/didnt try hard enough but boy do they make it hard i actually think i might get fired in december and not because im not doing my job but because hes so fixated on one thing that he doesnt think im excelling in he ignores all my other strengths note that he said during our meeting i dont tell new employees that i expect thing i just wait to see if theyll do it on their own which just sounds like something an abusive boyfriend would say honestly    i have no idea if i should call another meeting on monday because im so confused now im defeated and lost
  blame the invention of no fault divorce people are much more cautious about marriage when the other party can at any time just up and leave and fuck them over which combined with some other social factors has created hookup and casual dating culture    ill confess my love to you if youre cute and live nearby
  wanting to get married before determining your compatibility  why would anyone do this
  you should quit any job ive ever cried over out of stress has ended poorly either i got fired and had the walk of shame being escorted out like im gonna chimp out and smash the computers really brah or i quit with no notice and walked out from sheer spite   actually i hate my current job almost that much now god life sucks tfw no sugar daddy bf so i dont have to work thanks feminists i really love this whole everyone works everyone suffers career girl thing tfw not cooking tasty things in a /comfy/ kitchen right now for a loving husband tfw no husband tfw no money tfw hate job  im actually really pissed that i work and half my paycheck goes to rent im about to opt out of my lease and room up with someone for an easy 500 a month savings from my current situation but i need to find a sucker to take over my lease first and then ill have money but also roommates
  do you think hes still into going anymore now that hes an excon
  speaking of i had a job do that to me extend the review whatever you like to call it period again and again in the end they kept on the girl who had my position and was going to leave who was being paid far less than i was for essentially the same exact job i saw through their shit i had already been looking but with zero effort so i ended up on the unemployment savingskiller again   companies are lying shitbags man i got a new job making even more so their loss fuckstains anyway if a place promises something and its not in writing and they dont deliver on time assume theyre going to wriggle out of it and try to screw you over     something you enjoy  just doing anything for 8 hours a day pisses me off anon and especially fucking commuting prostitution would be nice since i do enjoy some good cock but thats illegal because moralfaggots
  honestly anon i wouldnt rush into anything i know so many people who are divorced these days and a lot of it are folks who married their partners without really knowing the full picture or without being ready to fully commit i think ultimately you just need to find someone who is on the same page as you but to be honest the kind of men on dating sites who have intentions to marry often end up being the kind of men who are a bit crazy and controlling
  feminists didnt take that away from you honey youre just too ugly or too old to score a sugar daddy its not terribly hard
  did they tell you they would give you a review and possible raise after ninety days i avoid ones like that i think its sketchy as fuck   i would not worry about the six months thing they sound like bullshit and not being somewhere for six months isnt a kiss of death when there are so many predatory places like this
  i do enjoy some good cock  would you really expect the cock you get from prostitution to be good
  living in a place with illegal prostitution  what kind of a third world shithole is this
my best friend wants to have sex with me i thought we were both straight
  you can tell things within a few dates anon it shouldnt take literally years to figure out whether or not you like someone     tfw no romantic qt boy to confess his love to me  and fuck the whole of it but really its an international issue so i dont think national court decisions are the sole factor here tfw no husband tfw cold and no qt bf to be a living heater for my benefit
  try it you might like it
  like the other anon said you can blame reagan i also want to get married but ive already determined that im not compatible with anyone so having a roommate i can cuddle is more than enough for me promise not to steal my shit and id wife you right up      why would anyone do this  see above
  sure but theres a difference between liking someone and wanting to spend the rest of your life with them
  thats what im afraid of
  spoileri have a sugar daddy/spoiler oooh back in your face my pussy sells for top dollar but i only have one arrangement and its a once a month ppm not paying the rent those fistfulls of hundreds are pretty nice though if i had five more sugar daddies id be set
  the worst people are really good at hiding their true selves until theyre in position to destroy you
  how does this differ from prostitution
  promise not to steal my shit  im a minimalist so i dont want your shit take some of mine i may temporarily borrow any frilly dresses you have though   im not compatible with anyone  iktf
  it can happen anon i gave my wife a straightforward agreement on the first date here is what im looking for in a wife  1 healthy  2 rational  3 loyal  thats it if you prove you are these things i will marry you on the spot the purpose of dating is to see if i satisfy you and if i can trust you and if these things hold true nothing else you say or do matters i will not leave you  we were engaged 4 months later well have been together 5 years in january      the thing is few people in our generation ever actually determine compatibility at least not on their first marriage my 40yo cousins remarried and did basically what i did with their husbands in order to determine compatibility you need to know what actually matters to you what is your bottom line at which youd rather be alone if you know your bottom line a practical negotiation is easy and so is commitment
  part if the reason ive never made it to a relationship is because i dont have the patience for the pussyfooting and uncertainty befoore youre actually in onr
  when two autists collide
  enjoy your 3rd 4th and 5th marriage my perfectly normal friendo 
  im never going to get married marriage is for suckas
  the cops dont know about it     people grow together and mold each other pretty significantly people used to work out their relationship problems not hire the divorce lawyer the instant they get hurt feefees as long as you discuss the major important shit and seem to like each others company it ought to work out just fine these date for five years and still arent married deals though fuck that men dont think twice about wasting a womans best years of her life and then just jumping ship to go shag sluts another 510 years i dont want that shit dating should take 1 year at very most and then yes/no on it for gods sake at very very most modern dating is total cancer its such a big hassle to find anyone interested in relationships and not a quick fuck to get their dick wet and from there that 1/1000 turns to 1/100000000 for a guy who actually wants to commit nigga if you like it put a ring on it   so im reading all these old books and essentially their parents hook them up with someone appropriate man its so /comfy/ not having to worry about being single forever i just want a husband now not dating a bunch of guys on a maybeinafewyearsmaybenever deal
  any frilly dresses  funny you should mention that as im a minimalist with clothing i have a bunch of fancy stuff and multiple cars but like a week and a halfs worth of clothes id be happy to buy you frilly shit though  so whens the wedding
  modern dating is total cancer its such a big hassle to find anyone interested in relationships and not a quick fuck to get their dick wet  that part ill agree with
  complaining they cant find a guy to commit    have you tried dating girls recently even the girls who say they want a boyfriend dont want a boyfriend they want an accessory a symbolic status boyfriend so they can say they have a boyfriend to their friends and get asspats on social media because relationship goals and shit that like has made them retarded
  they want an accessory  they want an atm dude
  not all girls    some girls want a replacement affection machine because daddy never loved them
had this really weird almost scary dream    there is this game lolita plays  its almost like a bet but with other details included that i dont remember  loser needs to loose something from their body  that means you have to shave off your hair cut off a bit of your body orwhatever else the winner might want you to get rid of  ends up in one of those bets  lose because i saw that a fairly disliked girl on my comm dressed my mom up in a horrible ita mess and she got posted in several ita threads  this made me so angry i lost the bet somehow  had to cut off a part of my finger  was both in pain and incredibly insecure over my left hand the rest of the dream  had to check both my hands when i woke up    i 100 believed this game was a thing even after a few minutes after i woke up because how the game was laid out made it kind of plausible in the lolita community somehow
  modern dating is total cancer  i just want a husband now not dating a bunch of guys on a maybeinafewyearsmaybenever deal    fuck im a guy and i know that feel im not even sure why i know that feel but i do maybe just watching my own buddies suck at relationships and fuck things up with women with more sense than them    and its a totally different feel from the soul shattering despair of putting on a completely fake face that you know isnt going to matter after a month of dating but if you dont do it it sets off red flags and you get ghosted because you didnt carry out the ritual deception properly
    oh you can bet that whenever i quit i wont give them any notice they dont deserve that courtesy after all this i would love to pull the rug out from under them just like theyve done to me    im not really career oriented either im not competitive even though i practically worked myself to death in school because i was a straighta student i dont really want a career i would feel fulfilled by just having a family and caring for them but yeah apparently women need to do it all now and be independent        im seeing the bigger picture more and more and i think the boss is just not a good guy it really sucks that it has to be this way i wish people were just fair      yes  at 90 days they said i would get a review and they told me that normally also comes with a raise it would make sense because ill soon be training new employees in my department which in itself is insane and should be done by a senior member but because they had so many people quit im the only one left in my little section and they are now counting on me so just that makes me feel like i already deserve a raise    it is sketchy as hell now like you said my gut knows i dont belong at this place anymore but jobsearching sucks the life out of me so yes im part of the problem but hell it just sucks
  nothing wrong with being gay anon      the silhouette is very similar to victorian childrens clothes so even in classic theres no getting away from it unless its a dress with toneddown poof the 50s were basically the only era where petticoats were in fashion and adult women wore skirts around the knee before the 20th century anything shorter than anklelength was for children
  these date for five years and still arent married deals though fuck that men dont think twice about wasting a womans best years of her life and then just jumping ship to go shag sluts another 510 years i dont want that shit dating should take 1 year at very most and then yes/no on it for gods sake at very very most  wait why does it matter  dont get married  guy leaves after ten years to fuck sluts  get married  guy divorces after ten years to fuck sluts  are you just looking for the divorce payout   im not entirely convinced the thread isnt full of roleplayers
  he wont get a divorce because that would fuck him over financially hell just cheat
  if you can prove in court that you were in a relationship for x amount of time and lived together even without marriage you can claim each others assets
  it really sucks that it has to be this way i wish people were just fair  as an entrepreneur and business owner it makes me cringe to hear stories like that its well established in business science that happy workers are productive workers and the job of hr should be to retain quality workers with a budget designated for pay raises and time off this is well known yet even major corporations are treating hrs job as protect the company from employee lawsuits by burdening them with tedious legal seminars     its stepping over dollars to pick up pennies and it really does hurt to look at    for what its worth one of the reasons you hear so many stories like that is because shitty jobs have high employee turnover meaning lots of people have that experience but good jobs retain competent employees for a lifetime so you dont hear about it
man i just really love lolita
  why
  i really love the sweet lolita aesthetic   i cant explain the good feeling i get when i stare at my wardrobe and get to pick out what im going to wear for the day
  all this  and more
  as someone who wants to be in a management position one day this hurts me too the whole time ive been at this place ive never really been supported rewarded or told im valued im not looking for anything big but most companies understand that a simple verbal you did a good job on this keep it up really increases morale and it doesnt cost a thing     theres pretty much no sense of emotional wellbeing here i dont think my boss even knows thats something that needs to be included in order to retain employees the only people who remain are those who have been at the company for 3 years everyone a year or less has quit i am one of two new hires left i dont know how my boss thinks he can sustain and grow his company this way
  such a good thread bless
my gf broke up with me i thought she was the one but apparently not i have no idea how to meet new people anywhere though i just got lucky with my ex     if youd like to talk with a slightly depressed but always tries his hardest bf my discord is pixypulse8655

does this count as cgl feels if were both weebs and he helped me cosplay i just need to vent somewhere anonymous with maybe some insight leddit is not the place for that and i feel stupid about this morning    wake up this morning bf usually wakes up earlier than me like 95/10 times  stomach pains while in bed still waking up run to the bathroom after a particularly bad one  reliefpng  still hurting ask bf to come in bathroom with me  he does sits with me holding my hand til im done  use babywipe clean everything only use a line of tissues to clean any excess or wetness from babywipe  flush with only a few tissues in the toilet mind you  toilet clogs  oopsieididapoopsiejpeg  can you unclog it bf while giggling because im still embarrassed sometimes and dont know how to unclog toilet he does not know this  no you can do it you clogged it  me processing error 404    and because i asked 23 more times for him to unclog it before he finally did and it took him maybe 30 seconds to unclog it and back to normal hes upset i wouldnt unclog the toilet    i have never clogged his toilet in our year of dating i ask him to unclog it one time when my stomach was hurting and it was early in the morning and he said its a common courtesy thing you clogged it you unclog it    mfw this isnt common courtesy youre dating me for a year now and this aint no fuckin common courtesy    he then finds out i dont know how to unclog one and tries to be nice about it but im still butthurt that he wouldnt even fucking unclog a goddamn toilet that takes him 2 seconds to unclog when i was in pain and barely awake and he had already been awake for like an hour he knew i had to leave early because its my dads birthday today so i left upset and we havent texted yet am i being entitled/stupid
  asks someone to witness you drop a deuce  what the fuck
  youre disgusting and should have been broken up with on the spot
  when youre having serious stomach problems and curling over yourself on the toilet in pain yeah i think its okay for my bf to at least be near me    weve both had to help each other vomiting and the likes i think being in the bathroom together while someone is peeing/pooping isnt the weirdest thing ever anon
  signs of someone who has never been in a relationship this response
  i have youre never going to get married
  bitch you dont need your bf with you you need a doctor  i think being in the bathroom together while someone is peeing/pooping isnt the weirdest thing ever  never said it is ive showered while my bf takes a crap on the toilet right beside me before the problem is him being in the bathroom with you specifically to watch you poop what the fuck
  who said he was watching me he was on his phone playing a game the entire time he wasnt staring into my asshole waiting for shit to come out
  my point was that he goes into the bathroom to not use it other than to be right beside you while you poop   you need to see a doctor both medical and psychological
  i dont see how me being scared because i was in pain is wrong to ask my boyfriend to come in the bathroom because i was worried for myself he didnt wipe me he didnt check my shit he wasnt staring at me how the fuck am i delusional for wanting comfort for a few minutes max especially when something like the toilet clogging happens and i dont know how the fuck to unclog it
  i dont see how me being scared because my tummy hurts  how old are you seriously do you think this is endearing or something  why are straightoids so disgusting never reply to me ever again diaper girl
  and i dont know how the fuck to unclog it  this is the thing that gets me how have you made it this far in life having never learned to use a plunger
  would you like an extensive background of medical history my social and credit card info anon its not supposed to be endearing its asking for help when i needed it you braindead ape      because i dont use 30 pieces of toilet paper and dont take massive shits ive never needed to unclog anything
  its asking for help when i needed it  from a doctor not from your bf who didnt need to smell your disgusting shit and could probably do much better than a trainwreck like you  didnt i tell you not to reply to me anymore fuck off
  maybe this is the first thing that has happened for me to realize i need a fucking doctor you insensitive autist im glad this one scenario proves you have my entire relationship and my personal workings figured out you are 200 iq im sorry i ever messed with you anon dont come to my house with a katana and kill me in the name of the gays
  im sorry  yeah you should be poop girl now go see a doctor for your ibs before you die of dysentery
  im going to ignore the weirdness of asking someone to accompany you while you poop and address the issue you raised if you clog it you unclog it its really simple and is definitely common courtesy not knowing how to is fine but you shouldve just said so and let him teach you you do come across as a bit of a spoiled brat here
  ive never needed to unclog anything  next question do you have a learning disability how can you look at a plunger and a toilet and not put two and two together nobody ever taught me how to unclog a toilet either i learned from fucking cartoons and dealing with garbage toilets in ancient houses  if nothing else you couldve just asked your bf to teach you since youve already thrown your pride and dignity completely out the window and then at least youd come out of this ordeal as a slightly better human being
  thanks for the first genuine reply anon    apparently its super weird to cgl to have someone you trust come in the bathroom when youre in pain on the toilet but thats besides the point and ignores the entire reason i posted in the first place    it was already too late to say anything to begin with about me not knowing how so i felt like i couldnt because its embarrassing that ive never done it before i texted him apologizing but maybe this is also stemming from other things about him that have been irritating me and i was just quick to get upset about this halfawake
    im sure your lizard spouses enjoy your shitty attitude of someone asking for insight and help not spitting acid as your first response
  alright smelly poop girl dont get your diapers in a knot
  jokes on you i live alone when im taking a particularly painful shit i deal with it myself like an adult
    at this point its cathartic to argue with incels like you two on this board after ive already realized the error of my thought process and am handling the situation but continue you guys are the type to need the last word
  ironically this means nobody ever taught you how to plunge a toilet because it actually is counterintuitive you dont push air down the chute with the plunger what you want to do is create a vacuum seal and give a sharp tug     you stand there pushing the plunger shaft up and down and all youre doing is splattering shit water      this is a sincere and wise response anon      this is a flamer id say troll but theyre so full of shit they clearly believe in their own    it is a little unusual to seek emotional comfort for a bowel movement but its not a big deal either you dont need a doctor you should be aware by communicating whether your boyfriend resents your needy behavior if he does and you care about him staying resolve to be a little more independent but dont assume he resents it either people like to feel needed too
  anon asks bf to hold her hand while giving birth to a shitbaby  then wants him to clean the afterbirth  family thats just not right   also read unbearable lightness of being and theres a character who sexually fantasizes about her lover watching her take a shit and then fucking her     especially when something like the toilet clogging happens and i dont know how the fuck to unclog it  somewhat plausible because tis the mans job to fix shit maybe literally shit but still anon i unclog my own toilet dont even have a plunger we have google now its fantastic five minutes on youtube and you will be a shitclog expert my toilet clogs like every fucking week because budget piping
  but theyre so full of shit they clearly believe in their own  what honey leave the witty remarks to us youre clearly not cut out for it
  ever consider the reason youre so thirsty might be all that salt 
hey guys whats going on in this thr    oh my god
  trips of truth thread literally shitposting  auto sage rip  tfw no bf
  apparently its super weird to cgl to have someone you trust come in the bathroom when youre in pain on the toilet  if youre not a toddler yes it is weird
            this is why we need feminism not even memeing you should be more independent when it comes to minor things like this  literally needing your hand held because muh shit pains
  i agree im becoming the thing i hate im seeing a therapist the responses can fuck off now cgl is a shit board pun intended
  you made it shit sweetie
  aaaaaaand case and point sweaty
  just following your pun hun  also its case in point fyi
  thats not following a pun thats being a degenerate who is still instigating when the discussion is already over    like i said i knew you were the type to need the last word insufferable cunt
  still instigating  but youre the one who brought it up again in the first place  oml im so confused like srs
  i was responding to a complete different person and you went out of your way to respond to me again thats instigating    i was trying to give benefit of the doubt to being a troll but goddamn youre just actually retarded and an insufferable cunt and you should highly consider killing yourself at least ive admitted to seeking out help youre pathetic
  dont be upset just because you got called out on your hypocrisy hun maybe you should get your bf to hold your hand while posting on /cgl/ next time too lmao
  lmao youre so epic dude
learned how to take care of self cut hair in flattering cut skincare etc thanks to /cgl/  look in mirror  god damn im cute  im literally so cute how do i contain this smug
  i honestly cant tell if this is a bait post or not but sometimes my bf clogs the toilet and i unclog it and vice versa especially when one of us has to leave soon or is in pain     he has a weird plunger that i didnt know how to use when i first moved in but he taught me how to use it even though hes faster at unclogging i still do it myself most of the time    hes also held my hand a few times when i had pee/poop issues mainly during illness/uti but he knows id do it for him as well his immune system is 100x stronger than mine though
  why contain it youre a selfsufficient adult which means youre doing better than 90 of the people on this godforsaken board the fact that you manage to be adorable while doing it is icing on the cake
  he has a weird plunger  elaborate im curious how weird a plunger can get
  you dont push air down the chute with the plunger what you want to do is create a vacuum seal and give a sharp tug  weird my selftaught method is the opposite of this the best way ive found is to force all the air out of the plunger and fill it with the excess water in the bowl then give it a sharp thrust to force that water down the pipes usually taking the obstruction with it works the first time every time
  no it wasnt a bait post unfortunately anon who posted it but i shouldve worded it a little more intelligently i was just in the heat of the moment    ive already moved on from it and have been talking to my boyfriend but i do appreciate your response because someone actually understands it isnt weird to have your so comfort you in a time of pain because i would do the exact thing for him too like you said    ive been wracking myself about all these shitty responses thinking im actually weird for asking for my bf to come to the bathroom but i know its not and its perfectly normal to ask for help when youre worried or scared about yourself    im going to have him show me how he uses his on his toilet so we can both do it for times when we need help like the examples you gave
  it isnt weird to have your so comfort you in a time of pain   its perfectly normal to ask for help when youre worried or scared about yourself  jesus christ youre taking a shit not giving birth its not that serious even as i child i could take painful elephant sized shits without anyones help
  its not exactly weird i just never saw a plunger like it before i was used to plungers that look like the one on the right      im glad i could help none of these anons realize you should take care of your so when theyre sick or need help and that includes when theyre doubled over in pain while on the shitter      stomach pains / butthole pains
  works the first time every time  by good fortune then but what you describe is how i used to do it myself and it doesnt suffice for more obstinate clogs      at least ive admitted to seeking out help  youre not seriously going to throw money at a therapist over this are you please dont save it for your wardrobe      it isnt weird to have your so comfort you in a time of pain because i would do the exact thing for him  couples have varying levels of codependency and its fine if your mutually preferred level of codependency is very high just be sure to communicate with him that this is something he actually wants and isnt just something hes putting up with if youre both on the same page there will be no problems    if youre not on the same page you both need to decide what is important to you but this isnt something to panic about and threaten to leave over its just if you want 99 levels of codependence and he wants 80 you just need to work it out between you  1 do you split the difference at 90 codependence  2 do you become more independent because hes worth it in other ways  3 does he accept your dependence because youre worth it in other ways    reciprocity looks fair but often isnt its like him saying why wont she shave my beard for me id shave her beard if she ever needed me too if the thing offered in return is only of value to one party its only superficially reciprocating but that doesnt mean you cant desire comfort either it just means you need to contribute enough value to the relationship to be worth it and if you cant/dont consider lowering your demands    in reality its not like you have a relationship checkbook to balance though so mostly its just a matter of communicating your feelings and being sensitive to his when he replies    good luck anon
  we actually have one of those in our bathroom at work never thought anybody would buy one for home use because theyre kinda shit no pun intended
  the one on the left or the one on the right
  left the molded plastic accordion abomination  you mentioned being used to the right example so i assumed your bf has the left one am i wrong
  stomach pains / butthole pains  neither of those are that serious if youre just shitting and neither require someone elses help once again even literal children can manage it
  he does i didnt know it was worse will let him know      so you would ignore your so if they had stomach pains shitting or not
  i wouldnt ignore them but also wouldnt hold their hand like a baby id fix them tea or anything else hot to drink that usually works for me
  will let him know  its just like my opinion man no need to make him waste money on a new plunger if it works it works im just not a fan    also to chime in on this whole painful shit thing i dont think anybody here outright believes that your bf/gf being in pain is some mundane event that can be ignored the way i see it is most people dont want to be right next to you while youre shitting myself included likewise i wouldnt want anybody in the bathroom with me while im taking a particularly painful shit its only emotional support anyway so i think its perfectly adequate to both give and receive said support through a closed door it doesnt take two people to take a shit
  be depressed shy kid  get /fit/ and start taking care of myself after entering uni  put myself out into the world  not shy anymore feeling confident  sucked more dicks than id like to admit  loved it but want to move up leagues  develop an eating disorder in order to even look better according to the warped standards of grindr dating  start failing classes  start exhibiting bpd and sociopathic tendencies   all this culminates in me collapsing on the train and bystanders have to call the ambulance on me  hard lesson learned desu
  and people say homosexuality isnt a mental illness  jokes aside i hope youre doing ok
  collapsing on the train  ill probably be there eventually since i skip meals often i was a bit of an ugly duckling bad haircut uncared for neglected dressed in rags now i look like a freaking cheerleader or something its so amazing this was under there the whole time feels bad that i didnt /make it/ in time for college to get that mrs degree   im so cute i should be a model or something shame this didnt happen 510 years agothanks neglectful abusive poorfag parents also had depression really hard as a teen/early 20s so i know that feel its like years of my life were consumed in this black pit i have few memories of the time and essentially did nothing but stagnate in poverty and isolation  but now im cute as fuck and will wear all of the nanchatte and look like some boarding school princess like my chinese cartoons same haircut and eyecolor/complexion and everything  i still want to get a few very minor cosmetic fixes though gotta be as close to perfection as my lazy self can attain   got some permanent health issues from the depression period though nothing visible but feels bad man that shit fucks you up i couldnt even manage basic healthcare and hygiene/grooming during that black period
  dont worry sweetie ive been called much worse  im fine now currently doing a phd at a pretty reputable institute and plenty of friends getting a bf and having a concrete set of goals helped a lot back in uni    sorry to hear that anon hope everything goes as planned for you and you become the most kawaii mf there ever was
  this is the purest post on this site also i want to visit the alternate grandma dimension
  youre paying this person to asist you with your problems its like going into the doctor for a failing liver but pretending that you dont drink chances are that this person knows or will know of your obsessive behaviors and  youre definitely not the first odd case theyve seen people are literally out here eating drywall their own pee and gravel liking 2d tiddies  other degenerate categories is not the worst you could do and if they do judge you move to a therapist who is actually willing to listen to you
  i never understood that arguement when ddlg exists and yet no one points a finger at that youre not wearing diapers and sucking on binkies youre accentuating your features cutesy or otherwise like an adult woman its just shows how glaring their ignorance is i should mention that i know this despite not being a lolita btw
  try visiting arists alley   you cant get this shit online but its cheaper in person  its unique merchandise that you wont find anywhere but by this seller  these shops have short availability windows that make the con visit worthwhile  youre supporting local artists    alternatively doing all the things you find mundane alone will be more exciting with friends or at least people you can talk about it with ive heard of /cgl/ con meetups in the past but i cant say i recommend them or not as ive never been to one
  this  i was losing that love of cons until my spark was reignited by chasing my longterm dream of cosplaying it was a simple storebought w/ personalized wig and accessories but it light a fire in my heart and now im going from scratch on my next costume fuck ive never even used a machine before and now im making a bodice from scratch i hope you find that fire too anon
  oh anon thats not abnormal at all i think you absolutely need to be open with your therapist about this everyone watches porn theyre not going to judge its their job not to judge
   simple f4f  f4f are not looking to make friends its a pure social transaction they need to bolster their numbers thats like looking for love in an arranged marriage      she runs off to meet a million of her online friends while i dont have any to meet  go make friends with her friends too social networking in the truest sense
  fuck you for making me laugh this hard
  which just sounds like something an abusive boyfriend would say honestly  it sure as hell does work that weakness hes begged you for into your next interview question segment    maybe you could look for a another job in the same field or a transfer to a different sector of that business if possible if you find yourself getting closer to the time youre going to be leaving just talk to that boss open and earnestly youll have nothing to lose except maybe having things turn out right im rooting for you business anonchan
  you need some time before you think about finding someone else work on your hurt and yourself as a person first itll get easier and some good will come from this
  what the fuck are you scared about its just poop pains youre not going to pop a hernia
  why cant he cuddle you after youre finished pooping if youre so scared why does he have to be there while you do the deed
  id comfort them after they were done shitting i have no need to inhale their poopy air
  thats a good point i dont know anymore it just seems so strange for all that to happen in only a year ya know
tfw 80 of why i would want a gf is for couple cosplay and to have someone to cosplay with since none of my friends do so  outwardly normie so people wouldnt know i do it let alone girls  moderately good looking and fit but i cant flirt for the life of me because i dont want to come off creepy and autistic so i just banter and talk with them like theyre a guy  see girls straight up check me out and stare and just get really selfaware and antsy    this is slightly killing me inside and everytime i see a neckbeard with a cute girl it kills me slightly more inside like im my own biggest impediment
  as a neckbeard with a qt314 have you tried not being a beta orbiter which incidentally is creepy and autistic    if you like a girl just straightforwardly tell her youre interested in dating to get to know her better if shes a dipshit and assumes that means want sum fuk promptly move on to the next one shell figure it out eventually that people arent fucking telepathic and have to communicate their intentions straightforwardly just let the spaz spaz shell be here and salty the next week but youll find a girl whos ready to seriously date quick enough
  i dont beta orbit at all actually i dont show my interest at all which is really fucking dumb now that i think about it for me an ideal gf is someone with enough common interests/hobbies to be fun to hang around with so its just a closer friend basically i dont want to risk losing that connection so i dont take the plunge and just go on being friends waiting for them to make the move     ive lost a couple of friends that i asked out that i wanted to stay friends with if they rejected in high school which made me more freaked out about losing more     i really really need to switch my mentality about it since that stupid way of thinking is driving me nuts over how im shooting myself in the leg
  i dont beta orbit i just hang around girls admiring them from my friendship capsule but never attempt reentry  youre a fucking orbiter amigo    i lost friends in high school by being honest about my feelings  yeah high schoolers are shitty and immature sorry you got burned sincerely its a shitty thing bro but hopefully youre older and the girls youre around are older and this will go better now    i dont recommend expressing your intention as lets be friends and then later changing it to lets date this frustrates women as they make plans based on the first thing and the second thing feels like you were dishonest i assure you things go much smoother if you just say youre interested date them and see if a friendship happens as you take them on dates where you discuss your hobbies and do the fun things friends would do but with the explicit and clear understanding for both parties this has the potential to lead to marriage and theyre not wasting their time if that is their objective and youre not wasting your time if its not their objective
tfw never had romantic experiences/gf ever  tfw hope to make contacts at cons  never do  tfw too dense to understand when people are interested until hours later when its too late  heck ive even had girls straight up tell me they want me and i just laugh it off and hurt them in the process
this is my first year not participating in any secret santas after three years of gigantic let downs that started with a cgl secret santa where i spent easily 400 on my ss getting her tons of brand shit and custom accessories and other gifts and got 10 worth of ugly aliexspress crap in return    its not even about the money im just so over putting in so much thought and energy for a stranger when i just keep getting people who realize last minute oh shit i signed up for a ss and send whatever they have lying around its not even that im hard to shop for i always provide a ton of options that range from broad generals pink cute to specific links to things oh well vent over
  drink more if that cant solve it nothing can
i was wondering if someone could give me advice  i just got a custom zentai suit put together and instead of ripping or cutting into the material to screw in punk spikes for this costume could i use adhesive magnets such as these to simply hold them in place i wouldnt be able to move my head too quickly im sure but i also am extremely against putting holes in the head of my suit unless i can reinforce it with extra fabric or supports somehow    does anyone have experience with something like this
check the fucking catalog

post cosplays you saw your cosplay or talk about panels or really anything related
the tuba guys werent there this year im so sad /
where did devin go
the idol panel sucked half of them didnt show up and out of the ones there only one was good
a recent post got me thinking about cosplayers who make a habit of cheating in masquerades or craftsmanship contests especially since some contests have cash prizes attached now lets get a list going of cosplayers to be wary of and any interesting stories you have about contest cheating this can include    claiming you made a massproduced cosplay  claiming you made a commissioned cosplay  lying about how a part of a cosplay was made or if it was made at all  repeated sandbagging aka entering multiple contests with a cosplay that already won a more prestigious contest  sandbagging the same convention with the same cosplay
  op image is papertoadette multitime cheater in new england most recently stirred up a shitstorm after her obviously china factory 2b dress won best masters craftsmanship at a smallmedium sized con when people started pointing fingers about it on the cons page she doubled down by    claiming the whole thing was a witchhunt brought on by an exfriend  claiming that china stole product images from her and thats why they look so similar  claiming she had no progress photos because she just never took them  posting a free tutorial to her patreon page as proof that she handsewed the embroidery herself the template she posted didnt match the dresss embroidery and was stolen from an etsy sellers page which she claimed to be ignorant of after said seller demanded she take it down and stop posting it for free    sadly the con did not take away her award and it just ended up damaging their reputation
i said this in the other thread too but some cheaters will go through huge efforts to fool judges theyll bring in tons of progress photos and talk in detail about how outfit was made even though it was commissioned however i only see this level of effort when good prizes are involved
guy who won the tales of ambassador contest in 2015 cheated white coat in the middle hes actually a huge trainwreck so lemme summarize     didnt make his costume his friends mom did   hes never made a costume in his life   applique is made of foam so he cant wash the costume   continues to wear the untreated costume for the next 3 years he has no others   won the competition but doesnt have a valid visa so he couldnt even travel around europe to represent the company visa was a requirement of entering   proceeds to creep on any asian girl but only the japanese pretends hes japanese and thinks hes best buds with raika i wish i was joking   emotionally abused and manipulated his friends because they arent japanese or worshipping his cosplay   plans to enter ecg because hes a professional cosplayer now
  in the case of bought costumes the judges should easily be able to tell when something is mass produced so really the judges fault for this one
  bought doesnt necessarily mean mass produced you can commission a hand made costume and thats still buying one
pretty sure angi viper either paid off or fucked the judges for la comic con because there is no way in hell that christmas elsa should have won best master putting lights and a smoke machine on a costume where they dont even make much sense does not make it a winner especially when the competition is stiff
did anyone find out something about the last thread where we talked about the ff summoner cosplay i was very interested in it and researched a lot to find stuff lmao thread got deleted just a while ago i see
not really cheating but morally wrong a gal went to really small cons 1k attendance just to win entrylevel competitions she herself had been cosplaying for years and her competors were like 14y/o with their first costumes for some reason she never went to bigger ones maybe she was afraid of losing
  i did that once expecting the level to be better man i felt bad
  me too but the competition at the same con the previous year had been much stiffer so i brought out the big guns with a big new cosplay the next year but the con had dwindled and the competition was much less    interestingly the cosplayer who had actually won the previous year tried to compete again in essentially the same cosplay thankfully the staff didnt allow her in the contest
honestly this is 100 the con/judges fault ive judged at conventions big and small and you can tell when something is factory if the con picked noncraftsman cosplayers or even worse voice actors then its their fault for not catching it
  like  and  said the big scandals usually involve someone trying to pass a commissioned cosplay off as their own work the only way you can tell a cosplayer is cheating with a commissioned item is if they cant answer construction questions about how they made it or if one part of the cosplay was obviously made by someone else as a judge im sure youve seen this before
  oh god why are her titties halfway down her torso tho
  jesus whats his cosplay name i want to look more into this trainwreck
  found his twitter and ig hes a chinese guy pretending to be japanese every costume hes done which is like 4 in 4 years was made by someone else never done a single cosplay himself and never washes them either    hilariously hes tweeting thesabi/irabu still despite her being one of the people who originally called him out for his bullshit treatment of his friends    complete weeaboo scumbag and a cancer to the cosplay scene      
  bless you anon i hope he never comes to a tales convention here in north america
  he wouldnt hes too much of a weeaboo he works 3 jobs just to throw money at idol games and perv on japanese cosplayers i think youre safe    seriously surprised this creeper has never been mentioned before because hes absolutely vile
  probably because hes not prominent in the western cosplay community
  true hes a eurofag cant wait to see him enter ecg with a costume made by his aunt 3
i was judging at a con a couple of months ago a guy entered with a costume that he had bought off my friend i was attending with they werent friends had bought it from ebay but was claiming to have made it from scratch but had just repainted it lied when i called him out ended up having to put a lot of effort into getting him disqualified because the organisers are fucking idiots and cant organise anything were like oh maybe its just a similar costume surely someone wouldnt lie in a contest
  what con was this at i know the op pic was at ctcon but she didnt compete there im surprised that this happened the judges in the ne area are very experienced and ive worked with a good chunk of them at various cons also judging so them being fooled so easily is questionable to me
  wew that is one ugly muhfugga
  another anime conventions hall contest last year she tried to cheat in the 2016 masquerade too but got caught probably because it has stricter judging    
  i knew her for a while shes one of the most manipulate people i have ever met   always complain about money issues yet starts multiple gofundme accounts  complain about her mother being abusive  she has a band of beta orbiters who literally will defend her from any accusation one even doxxed a person who she didnt like  whenever she is accused of something she will cry and blame much autism did this   i finally stopped following awhile back when one of her followers was trying to find the location of some judge in a upcoming con also how i found it kind of creepy that she call her bf the boyfriend unit
  no but im curious about what happened with this too    cosplayer is kyoko__hana shes been posting progress to multiple outlets because shell be competing at fanfest with this summoner artifact 3 armor from final fantasy xiv its obvious its in the process of being commissioned because she lives in maine while all of the progress photos involve european household objects a bag with text in polish european style light switches a cutting mat that only has millimeter increments etc op of an earlier thread was trying to locate the polish commissioner based off of  in order to report her before the contest
  yeah this guy is a douche desperate for recognition with minimal effort
  if i remember correctly the people who judged the contest she was in were separate from those who judged the actual masquerade contest its becoming a trend to have big name people judge who have no way to tell their ass from their elbows and use their instagram count to vouch for them when they have no actual skill or knowledge
surprised that nobody has mentioned dokidoki yet
  i did some more digging on the guy and found out some interesting shit from one of the judges considering namco sponsors ecg this is pretty shocking    apparently the whole contest was rigged from the start they were not allowed to choose any german or french contestant because those countries had won before and they wanted to represent the whole of europe except most of the entrants were actually germans in addition to that they were asked to choose a male representative because of complaints about only picking girls there were only 2 make entries and the one was german so by default before the contest even began he automatically won even though hed lied about making his costume lied about his visa and exploited his friends to get there he wasnt even registered for the contest he just forced his way as a back up when of of girls who did apply wasnt able to make it    on top of that after he won he went about harassing the ecg contestants backstage because the winner gets to join the ecg contestants for the award i was speaking to one of the solo finalists that year on twitter about it and she mentioned him trying to get her phone number because she liked love live getting extremely close to her and then shit talking her to her friends in front of her face when she rejected him when they were up on the stage he purposely stamped on her dress and pushed her out of the way to get to the front because raika was a judge and he wanted to impress her she was in tears after the show and he made a snide remark on social media that she was salty over not winning      it doesnt end there either he frequently shit talks even his closest friends in private and tries to big up his own ego constantly hes a total narcissist and toxic asshole
   spill then
  hi kirigiri nice to see you here shit posting     why dont we talk about the fact that two major cosplayers are now banned from metro for changing the results of winners and referring to contestants as fat and ugly in their notes yet they still compete and try to save their shitty careers
doki doki literally badly photoshopped a reference picture because she was too lazy to paint some fucking boots with liquitex instead of putting millions of lights and other embellishments on her cosplay she got dqed she also entered the costume in another contest where she modified the cosplay to add more shit onto it but still did not paint the boots to match the reference picture she entered that cosplay into 3 contests without fixing it in the slightest she also almost never credits her 3d print jobs but thats besides the point
  seriously  no one  fucking  cares  at least she made her cosplay which can be said more than most people who enter these contests do you even make your own cosplays anon
  yea i do and i dont cheat when i make them doki doki l o l   just try to get better with costumes and things and try to shed good light onto your name because everyone knows that you cheated and thats not really okay but instead of coming on cgl and getting mad when people bring it up maybe you shouldnt have cheated in the first place and continued to try and fix your cosplay you could actually be doing good stuff but you continue to do mediocre work and think putting lights in it will fix it   and obviously ppl care because your name keeps coming up on these threads ppl should definitely be alerted to cheaters    but have fun continuing to place well in your masters class 
  as do you have fun in the masters class reina hope your not expecting on winning anything soon and i cant undo the past but i can better the future as should you do and grow up and stop being such a child and shit posting on 4chan you wanna shit post say it to my face dont just awkwardly avoid me at a con
  i really want you to do better i hope your cosplays improve heavily and you are better in the future i dont know who reina is because im not her and you have me pegged as someone else in your head but you have potential to do really good stuff i get disappointed watching you because i know you can do better you shouldnt get upset at people being upset about your wrong doings you should ignore it and try to move forward its a really bad look to argue with anons on 4chan there are people out there who really want to see you succeed and looking for negativity isnt how you do that i hope that you slow down in your creative process and improve greatly in turn    best of wishes moving forward
dokidoki  reina  kirigiri     all these basic bitch common cosplay names that make it impossible to find anything on google
      when you expose yourself this badly   god this is why you shouldnt post while butthurt
  how do you tell if one competition is more prestigious than another im not sure how to weigh con size against prestige of their competition especially when its often hard to find pictures of a previous years competitors except for maybe the winners if the con puts up photos     is there a list of competitions that are considered significant if you win something vs ones that arent judged fairly or by knowledgeable judges asking seriously
all this florida cosplay drama    arent you guys still hungover from iwai quit vendettafagging   anyway to be on topic there was an iron man cosplayer who won with a commissioned suit dude got banned from competing at supercon or something like that but i dont remember the details exactly
  i would say prestige is based on three things 1 the prize if its a big cash prize its more prestigious 2 is it an international qualifier/final if so its automatically going to be more prestigious 3 the people that usually enter what is the quality of previous years like high quality competitors attract each other
  florida cosplayers crave drama because its the only thing good going for them    shit i think the girls cosplay name is airomae or some shit i know for a fact that all of her shit is purchased at least when i knew her saw her giving up on armor and shit all the time because it was too hard
  you may be thinking of the guy who got caught competing with a commissioned carbon fiber genji at animate florida last year who was subsequently banned from all their shows including supercon it was also found that he had competed with a commissioned costume that same year at supercon he also owns a diablo costume that he posted progress pictures of as if he made it even though that was a commission too     and he treats his commissioners like shit gave this one commissioner a bunch of crap becuase a majin buu suit was too uncomfortable or something like that somehow ended up getting a partial refund
    size of the convention or the quality of the masquerade is also something to take into account however people usually dont split hairs like this with sandbagging entering two equally known contests even if one is technically bigger is still a dick move especially if they are in the same area imo there are only a few acceptable ways to multenter    jump from a local con couple thousand people or less to a regional one that people travel to acen katsucon etc  jump from a local or regional con to a circuit qualifier or a nationally known contest nycc c2e2 etc  dont win a best x prize at any con and then reenter at any con that allows for reentry other than the one you lost at    as an example of what not to do jedimanda is one of the more wellknown sandbaggers who technically doesnt break any rules but has earned a reputation in the midwest for entering her cosplays at as many contests as she can the fact that her cosplays are extremely well made exaserbates the problem because she usually ends up shutting out the competition which has made a lot of people bitter aka entering her amidala at star wars celebration acen and gencon or entering anastasia at both c2e2 which is about as top tier as you can get and dragoncon its allowed and its not cheating but it rubs people the wrong way
  oh god why are her titties halfway down her torso tho      i feel bad for chicks who dont know about good bras like people dont want t get personal so no one tells them
  okay i won something that was not a major award at a large con whose competition was panned as not legitimate here as well as among friends of mine due to the judges being personalities with a lot of fb likes and who are not well known for their craftsmanship    i improved the cosplay and entered at another con in a different region that was technically smaller but allegedly has a more legitimate panel of judges i asked the con if it was against the rules to enter something that had already won and they said it wasnt i was bumped up a class and given another award for it as best of that class neither of the awards i won were cash awards i got a certificate for both     i dont plan on making a habit of doing that and feel a bit weird about it but since everyone was saying the first contest wasnt a real contest i just wanted to make sure i entered it somewhere i would be judged fairly i have a degree of imposter syndrome and its hard for me to believe in my skills when people say a win wasnt based on skill     im not entering this cosplay anywhere else and feel a bit like i fucked up already by entering it twice i feel bad enough about it that i might just quietly bow out of entering competitions with anything in the future
  if you improved on it and entered at a higher level id say you did it fairly you pushed yourself to do better and so the costume you entered technically wasnt the same one anymore like you said youre not trying to make a habit of it just be proud of yourself for improving and now go for something even more of a challenge next time
  cant wash cosplay with foam parts  ok this is bs just get a portable garment steamer for like 25 at walmart dry cleans your cosplay and removes wrinkles tired of people not knowing this
  thanks that makes me feel better about it i know what i did wasnt against the rules at the competition but i dont want to be generating bad vibes in the community either if i can help it i try to choose projects based on techniques i want to learn so hopefully in another couple of years ill have left my present self in the dust craftsmanshipwise
  the fact that you didnt win a major award by itself makes it fine and the fact that you improved on it makes it extra fine if youd gotten best master or best in show thatd be another story unless you made some massive overhauls but its acceptable to reenter something that did not win at any previous sized con and desu as a judge id encourage reentering if the previous cons judging was questionable the classic case of sandbagging is when someone takes the same costume around to a ton of local conventions and gathers up first place at each of them or when they break the contest rules where no previous winners are allowed what you did is normal and none of the above and you shouldnt feel bad about wanting to improve and enter a legitimate contest
  sounds very similar to a girl in my area who now sells nudes of her half baked cosplay on patreon she parades around like some cosplay making master but her quality never seems to improve beyond spraypaint and hastily glueing fabric together she attends any small con locally either to enter contests to beat beginners or begs staff to be a judge or guest at the cons most of these small cons are really marketed towards children so its really in bad taste to me that she promotes her lewd patreon at them for a little while now her cosplays have started to improve at a ridiculously quick pace and now im sure shes just buying them factory made and passing them off as her own craftsmanship to these small town con staff who dont actually know anything about cosplay let alone how to thread a needle     been thinking of getting more serious into cosplay but i hold back because i dont want to be judged or judged alongside her especially if shes cheating now and uses con staff favoritism to win 99 of the time
      in a surprise twist kyoko__hana withdrew from the contest called herself out on cheating and posted a genuine apology im actually kind of impressed theres always the question of if shed done this if sleuthanon hadnt started publicly asking questions but this is the first time ive ever seen a potential cheater turn such a complete 180 good on her
  nice self post
  no dude its glued together with school glue the same as a prit stick any water or heat is gonna peel it off you dont realize how bad this costume is
  im one of the anons who was trying to find her commissioner
  uh dry cleaning isnt the same as steaming clothes are you confused
  based on the fact you use the term sandbagging you at least know the world costuming standards and terms because its at best poor form to do that and imho every damn high tier contest needs to have a rule you get 3 entries and if it wins one high level ie masters or above it is display only and retired
  honestly even if she hadnt come clean and still entered its not like the fanfest judges were following their own rules the kefka who entered placed top 20 and won 2nd place had his wife make the costume and they disclosed it to the judges meaning it should have been instantly disqualified there were so many other more deserving costumes that should have made the top 20 who got robbed because se staff decided to turn the other way in favour of fan pandering its honestly really discouraging
  was his wife present at the judging though most cons will allow someone else to wear the costume so long as the creator is actually present and gets the credit thats pretty normal but if she wasnt there then thats another story
  im entering in fan festa another se con and i fully expect a well known asian girl in the community to win even if in the pics shes posted of her cosplay the details are highly inaccurate and she didnt iron anything before constructing it shes a fine person but a beginner cosplayer who has no business winning contests but because shes known in the community and asian im sure shell be pickedthey favored her in new york last year despite other better cosplayers being there so im just entering because of my love for who im cosplaying as at this point
  she was but the rules explicitly stated that the person entering had to make most of the costume the way they announced the entries was by character name and world so there would be no way to give credit to another person on stage
  dont forget that the rest of the tutorial is for a dress shaped completely differently than the one shes wearing she doesnt even know how to sew well enough to know how to make that dress much less to have actually made it
  you will get there definitely just keep pushing yourself  i believe in you
can cosplayers in comissioned cosplays enter contests in it if the contest does not specify that it has to be something you crafted
what about cosplayers who are judging on cons and gives the prices to their friends
  eh sometimes its unavoidable if the con/community is small enough that most people know each other as long as the judges arent showing blatant favoritism and giving awards to costumes that obviously dont deserve it its fine imo
  its generally frowned upon ive had a commission customer ask me if they can enter my piece under my name though and as i was present at the con i agreed and we won something together but doing something other than a runway/strut your stuff show where its not for a prize that is taking the effort and claiming it as your own
  damn go shiina is so hot and /fa/ as fuck
a highend wcs eurocos  highly experienced cosplayer i know enters all contests including the ones intended for noobs its not cheating but its really unfair
    sorry to go off topic only slightly here but this guys a personal lolcow basically started up a cosplay help group on meetup and then proceeded to use everybody that showed up to make this cosplay in some shape or form he essentially tried to sabotage my cosplay at the time i didnt know how to sew but learned damn quick and made an incredible cosplay for my first made one by telling me he found the exact pattern of the complex costume by pulling some of his super rich guy strings then wouldnt show me the pattern or update me and then eventually ghosted me when he thought i couldnt make anything for his cosplay he sucked up to and stalked hollywood professionals on instagram so theyd make things for him  he carved a basic shape out of foam for the arm and then let somebody do almost all of the detailing couldnt sew his own simple as fuck coat made somebody make his hat/prosthetics and do his makeup for him and is an absolute bitch on top of that i know hes taken this costume to pax and all sorts including kumoricon but im not sure if he competed i wouldnt doubt it hes a cocky as fuck little gremlin that also loves to be sassy gay waluigi which hes surprisingly proud of somehow
    when in doubt email the coordinator ive judged at competitions where bought/commissioned costumes were allowed for the performance part but werent eligible for category or bis wins as long as youre not trying to pass off something as yours usually theres options
  thats not even a good 2b costume though shes missing the headband and the skirt looks to be sewn into the top/leotard sleeves dont poof right and the boots and thigh highs are wrong not to mention how sad those tits look in it its called boob tape honey judges were clearly friends if she fucking even placed in that mess    i think way back like 12ish years ago on here there was that chick who won a contest with that pink black butler dress from fanfriend we hounded the convention site and emailed them and spammed her da saying she was a cheater with a bought dress she got banned from competing in all her local cons
anons i need some advice on this    am competing at large regional con   judge for another con says i have a good shot at placing there   also agreed to compete at an official convention two weeks later  is like blizzcon or fanfest but smaller  worried it would be sandbagging if i entered after winning at regional con   is it sandbagging if i compete at a con with smaller atendance but much higher visibility/prestige
  sandbagging is shitty and this is why a good judge should simply say you are too good
  i think youre fine since the second con is more wellknown sandbagging isnt just about pure attendance numbers because you can have a more prestigious contest at a smaller con    also the cons are so close together that you basically have to commit to the second one before you know if you won at the first one    imo it takes some really blatant or serial entering before people take notice since sandbagging is so subject to the situation
  sells nudes of her half baked cosplay on patreon  link
  the cons are so close together that you basically have to commit to the second one before you know if you won at the first one  other anon i signed up for two competitions in the same month too with the same costume but i asked to switch costumes after i won the first one that would be the decent way to go about it and i would have withdrawn from the second contest if they didnt allow me to switch
wait im dumb so im still confused is it still sandbagging if you place at a small con then enter the same costume into a more prestigious contest or is it only when you place at a big contest then enter same level or lower contests because i want to go into competing but im slow as fuck so i dont think i can manage more than one competitionworthy costume a year
  its sandbagging if you already won a big contest and continue to enter at the same level or at a lower level in that case you can already be certain of a win since the competition will obviously below the skill level of your costume you dont have this when entering a competition thats more prestigious than the one you already placed for i hope this explanation helps a little
  im not from the usa and ive never seen a local contest that required that you crafted everything yourself    unfortunately here you cant take part on the cosplay parade without entering the contest so many cosplayers join just for it despite have no interest in competing at all
  if you change your costume a bit its tolerable from small to big for example make the costume more detailed or get better wig for big to small its sandbagging
    thx
i have a friend who entered me as a walk on in a masquerade at a big convention this past year  i didnt know until she told me she signed me up i was so embarrassed she expected me to wear her own cosplay that was way too big and flooded me on stage just to walk with her so she didnt have to be alone she also made me a pair of shoes that didnt fit right i dont know how to explain it but the shoe itself was bent side ways like the mold didnt form correctly she really expected me to wear her own cosplay and shoes that didnt fit correctly i didnt end up going on as a walk on and told the judges the truth they were happy i was honest with them but my friend was still able to complete keep in mind i dont compete because i dont think my sewing skills are all that good that and i just dont have any interest im a panelist and like to hang with my friends stuff like that i dont care about competing needless to say her and i arent friends anymore
  that sucks at least the judges were understanding but some friend she is for not even warning you in advance forget asking for your permission
  same i felt awful
  i remember seeing an fb status by one of my more coninvolved friends ranting about some cosplayer that won something but clearly had bought it from ezcosplay didnt ask for more tea since she seemed really upset
  it doesnt even look good
  thats what happens when they get judges who have clout but no knowledge of cosplay craftsmanship yeah random actor will get fans in attendance but if he cant tell the difference between a homemade and a massproduced costume hes got no business judging a competition
    as a judge my favorite thing is grilling wouldbe cheaters and watching them stumble over nonsense answers youd think people would bother to look up how their commissioner did things so they can answer but no people are so lazy
  what are you gonna do if i cheat be mad lmao
  do people even take cosplay contests seriously the best cosplayers never seem to enter them in the first place especially since for most cons its like a 10 hour commitment waiting to get judged practice runs etc   it seems that a lot of the good cosplayers will skip all that hassle and would rather spend the time showing off in public rather than to the measly 100 people who end up at the masquerade/contest
  me on the left
  some people enjoy it and the ones who do take them seriously depending on what con you go to there can be serious prizes involved too trips to japan or several thousand dollars are becoming more common
  what are you gonna do if i cheat  posts toad from paper mario    hi papertoadette whats up you know everyone in new england knows you bought your costume right
  i stopped entering cosplay contests because the amount of work i put into the cosplay didnt pay off in return to what 3 mins stage time i front of like a small  of the attendees you spend 68 hours in a room waiting for your time to talk to judges and have them inspect every seam you have sewn just to second guess yourself not to mention youre missing out on the con most of the day theres soo many people who youre missing and panels youre missing its just not worth it     plus the people who actually like your cosplay and appreciate your work are other attendees that usually dont go to the masquerade those are the people i like to interact with at a con and make the hard work worth it not a chance at a 1k check that would recover maybe the cost it took in fabric and notions i do it for the interaction with other fans not to be told i might have done a good job by someone who may or may not know what im cosplaying
    this thread is about contest cheaters not whether entering contests is worth it youre being defensive about something that isnt being discussed    has anyone notices cheaters trying to discredit contests after theyve been caught
  im  and i stopped entering contests because people cheat at them all the damned time its impossible to get credit for your work when someone is using someone elses work and claiming it was theirs for the prestige boost if you think saying leaving contests is defensive then i dont know what to tell you buddy because a lot of quality cosplay craters have stopped entering their own cosplays because of the saturation of cheating you get no one recognizing your work because you spend all day waiting to be judged while you could be out getting the recognition you really desire but instead you are stuck in a room with 80 commissioned cosplays that are being passed off as made by the cosplayer themselves its not a uncommon thing in the competition part of conventions any more its happening a lot since cosplay has gotten pretty mainstream at this point    point is cosplayers who actually put dedication and time stopped entering competitions because of cheaters saturating the completion that its more rewarding to simply not be a apart of the competition part any more so youre not associated with that garbage
  theres a girl in my local community who did this    talks up a big game about entering the contest at our local convention posts how stressed she is crunching on this costume and how nervous she is to perform for her fans on stage  whines on local fb group when she doesnt win boohoos about how hard she worked and how the judges didnt look closely enough at all the effort she made  uh maybe you didnt win because you bought half the cosplay from localcosplayer and only made the accessories/props  goes ballistic claims they just look similar because its the same show  friends rush to her defense how dare you accuse localthief of not making her own cosplay  others dogpiles her post side by sides  two weeks later makes a big post on her cosplay page about how she is boycotting local conventions contest because the judging is biased and its not worth her precious time when her fans want to see more of her
  curious as to where youre located i judge a lot of usa cons and while i normally see at least one cheater per contest of 3050 entries the normal size here rather than 80 entries its nowhere near the 80 you say
  yeah i dont doubt theres cheaters but its really not so prevalent that more than 10 of people cheat if that theres assholes everywhere but the majority of people are not that blatantly dishonest
i remember reading a weaboo horror story greentext where a girl invited some fat chick and her orbiter to a con the op made a zelda cosplay that she intended to use for the masquerade   she found out that the fat chick stole her cosplay when op managed to get it back she learns that the fat chick tried to enter the masquerade with her costume she also found out that the fat chick pretty much broke the cosplay because she was too fat to fit in and tore apart some stitching   i cant find the greentext but that constitute as cheating imo on the weaboos end
  i know what green text youre talking about the legend of elsa one of my favorites tbh its funny how with telling the story changes from the thief as a hot girl to the thief as a fattychan who broke the cosplay
  after rereading it i think i mixed 2 horror stories together the fatty cosplayer breaking the cosplay was another story   iirc it was one where op made a dress for a ball room dance event on the day of the ball the fatty stole the dress and ran off in the con and was nowhere to be seen i forgot where she was it was either panel video game room or a costume contest when op found the fatty and got her dress back the dress was broken and op couldnt attend the ball room event kinda sad story
/fit/ here  what should i wear for halloween next year  i was thinking bane

comments from people worried about wearing jfashion out are pretty common on the board for some wearing jfashion outdoors is rather easy but others have to deal with serious anxiety or a very hostile environment not all countries ar as liberal as america sadly lets have a discussion about it here    examples of what would be nice to read   useful strategies to deal with people taking pictures or harassment   emotional support for troubled souls    progress stories and maybe pics    how to deal with anxiety   good jfashion friendly places   and stuff like that
i usually wear jfashion to the cinema at coffee shops museums gardens i avoid pubs shops and restaurants unless im with someone else whos in lolita too
useful strategies to deal with people taking pictures or harassment  im not really that bothered when people take my picture without asking frankly i look a lot better in candids than staged/posed pictures so idgaf as for harassment it really depends on what it is in most cases i just ignore the person who tries to bother me but if they come up to me and talk to me directly i usually try to sound a bit bewildered and confused in response to inane questions and generally be politely stern and cold with them the goal is to make the harasser feel like the retard they are for bothering a complete stranger and it usually works at least for me
  ive started wearing it to class occasionally and have gotten pretty positive reactions so far for some reason the jehovahs witnesses who seem to hang out by our school absolutely love it
why would it be embarrassing to wear jfash in public people walk out of their houses wearing sweatpants and crocs for fucks sakes
  im not really that bothered when people take my picture without asking frankly i look a lot better in candids than staged/posed pictures so idgaf    good for you anon i wish i could not care as well but im too worried they will post them online or give them to friends to laugh at me     i usually try to sound a bit bewildered and confused     if i can walk away without answering them i usually do that it leaves them feeling like an idiot too i guess but your strategy might work for when i cant walk away like on buses etc so ill remember that
  who said it was embarrassing
its literally just clothing relax i live in alabama and get nothing but compliments from strangers in public  you arent going to get lynched for wearing weird clothing
  if theyre dealing with anxiety or are wary about wearing it on public that normally stems from embarrasment
for those lacking confidence try traveling a a flock of seagulls people are often hesitant to approach a group that looks like theyre doing something remember the weak ones get picked off first keep your delicate new gulls or shy ones in the center gulls who are good at fielding questions should bring up the rear or be on the outside so they can deal with it    if youre a lonelita the best thing you can do is adapt normie lady strats for staying unbothered on the train alt if you need a break and cant get away try carrying a bland coat so you can cover up people will stop taking pictures or staring if theres nothing to stare at
  if a person isnt very confident they tend to feel anxious when they stand out i can understand it really and its a good thing gulls ask about how to overcome this im all for seeing more jfash on the streets
  im too worried they will post them online or give them to friends to laugh at me  if you worry about your superiors or family members seeing that recognizing you and potentially giving you shit for it i suggest you at least turn around or block your face when you notice someone is taking your picture if your main concern is just that people might laugh at you then just try to shrug it off  i know its easier said than done but taking pictures of strangers on the streets to laugh at them is a shitty thing that shitty people do and its not worth even a second of your time to even think about
  its literally just clothing relax  thats what people who have never had a bad experience usually say you make it sound easy but it simply is not for people living in different places or cultures guess what i almost got lynched by a group of stupid teenagers just because i was wearing pastel clothes im glad accepting places exist but you should acknowledge that not everyone has it as easy as you
    luckily my family knows and support my love for japanese fashion my issue is more of the second kind you mentioned thank your for your kind words
  good luck anon i hope you feel braver wearing your favorite styles
  i wonder if this has been discussed i live in a very small town and small rural community most people i see and who see me know me and i know them i always feel like it would be too much to wear my jfashion outside just out and about    although i have gotten compliments before from my neighbors at special events like the local derby party and a street fair and i wear my meta tartan at christmas     i just dont know how to get over my hesitance to wear jfashion in an everyday environment in such a small community
  coming from someone who suffers from severe anxiety i tend to rarely ever wear it out on my own if i do dress in jfash i really only feel safe if thats the right word to use when i have my boyfriend with me no one really says anything to me when i have him with me    i used to and still kind of do have this mindset where i never wore it out because i didnt want people to feel awkward around me i was trying to please others instead of myself which is not the way to go about it if youre just starting out wearing jfash and you suffer from anxiety take it one step at a time dont force yourself to go out in a full coordinate when its only your first time try to mesh normie wear and jfash into something that you think looks like something anyone else would wear    one piece of advice though if you truly love this fashion you will overcome the anxieties that come with wearing it out eventually remember why youre wearing it and why you love this fashion as much as you do focus on yourself and what youre doing rather than what those around you are doing
  i have similar experiences here in georgia people seem to find it eccentric but charming in contrast when i lived in san francisco people shouted nasty things at me all the time and occasionally threw bottles at me from cars
  itll be easier to offer you solutions if we knew what made you hesitate in the first place what are you worried about
  its more like im afraid id be judged and those judgments will stick with me and it will get around and maybe my community wouldnt take me seriously anymore or would find me weird in a negative way its different when you live and work with the same people every day
  i wear a kilt every day youll get more good than bad
  this is a strange strategy but maybe it will help someone and this is something i do    i mostly wear lolita when im doing errands i work in a uniform 56 days a week so when i have a day off i generally need to run around doing stuff and dressing up ive never been out to eat in lolita actually i never eat out and all my friends are shut in computer nerds however my eyesight isnt very good and i take my glasses off for my coords dont have contacts because my eyes are little shits with powerful blink and flinch reflexes this results in me not really seeing people to be honest i can still shop just fine since im near sighted and read information but people are just something a bit blurred and unfocused i can easily trudge by cant notice stares very well even though i know theyre happening cant notice expressions so on you also just get used to it over time    i mostly just get compliments though i wear classic/gothic which normally passes strangest comment i got was asking if i was in a scottish costume group didnt even know that was a thing in the suburban midwest i did dress in louder sweet around christmas last year and got a few what character are you dressed as but you just say its not a costume its clothes and seem really busy to get away people are generally just curious not judging but may have a poor way of asking so just be polite and laugh and explain theyre japanese clothes or something
  what styles do you typically wear can you tone down your coords at all   solid classic tends to go well with normies a lot of times but you can probably make sweet work as well if you just wear it casually if theres a day when you have to go on a quick errand i suggest you wear a simple coord to test the waters ie see how you feel and how people react to you if you have to fake your confidence to feel less self conscious do so because people tend to react better when youre confident and own your look i imagine you wont have too many issues though considering youve already received positive reactions before
  take pride in it perhaps i take a lot of price in being a lot more fashionable than my normie coworkers and friends     i try very hard to be presentable and usually when a coworker or local sees me in lolita versus my uniform theyre amazed and very nice about it sure you may be unfortunate from time to time i have a coworker who got a bit creepy when i came in to buy some stuff in lolita i work at a grocery store but hes otherwise been fine maybe a tiny bit flirty but im his boss so he cant try anything and if he did work would help me out another coworker asked if i wore loli cosplay i full on cringed and explained to him what to call it and he laughed and understood my boss has said what on earth are you wearing but in the same instance another coworker said i looked really cool and acted normal around me and life goes on    those have been the only negative times with my coworkers though everyone else is really cool about it who know it probably helps ive worked here for years and am very friendly but assuming youre also a generally nice person im sure no one would try to hurt your feelings or be mean to you unless theyre a jerk
  this is actually hilarious i have bad eyesight and do struggle with nervousness about peoples stares in public but sadly i couldnt do this without getting an awful headache    i try to just imagine myself in a bubble people might look in but i cant notice anything outside of it except like scenery and menus and price tags its made me feel a lot better about going out in lolita in public and less anxious in general it took lots of practice though and i only really overcame the biggest hurdle by joining a comm and being out with them we attracted so much negative and positive attention that it was like therapy by exposure
  a person wearing crocs and sweatpants looks like they put no effort in so people assume a they were probably busy/sick/had a reason to look that way and b they already know they look bad so theres no point in telling them when you wear something that stands out but looks like you put effort into looking that way people get confused by the fact you tried to look dumb to them and think they need to come up to you to enlighten you
  i grew up in that kind of situation and ended up moving out i wear lolita regularly when im home for the holidays and dont get shit for it but i think thats probably because the teenagers who recognise me and would have given me shit have also all moved elsewhere looking for work so its only older people left
  good logic i agree sometimes i also think that some people that actually kind of like how youre dressed feel threatened by it because they would never be brave enough to stand out that much this is all at a subconscious level so in the end theyre left with this unpleasant feeling and try to justify it by belittling you       my two cents gradually start wearing lolita more maybe use socials to post nice pictures get people used to your style little by little throw hints to make others know that lolita makes you happy so that it will be harder for them to criticise you without a good reason always look confident and people wont question your choice make it look like you dont care to be judged that way judgements will loose all their power and people will stop fake it until you make it have someone that supports you be if your partner best friend or family good luck
  greetings fellow alabamian what part of the state are you from and are you in a comm
  i almost got lynched by a group of stupid teenagers just because i was wearing pastel clothes  doubt  when it comes to any type of bullying over anything confidence helps you arent going to hear someone with a lot of self confidence say they are bullied as much as a shy person says they are      huntsville im not in a comm my lolita friend was suppose to ask about joining a local comm but she is a spaz and idk what ended up happening with that was a while ago should probably look back into it
do you have any toned down lolita inspo for ex coords that wouldnt catch too much attention but still cohesive and well done
i live in a third world country i get stared at a lot in public if im in jfash i mostly wear dolly kei nanchatte larme otome goth/gothicinspired fashion and menhera but ive never been approached with anything but compliments i also only know english and a lot of people assume im a foreigner so if people are making comments about me i straight up wont understand 70 of the time  its very easy on me and im thankful for that i have anxiety and hate going outside more than maybe twice a week but my clothes make me feel happy like im myself  if people take photos of me i dont notice its not my problem anyway if theyre too pussy to make themselves known and would rather hide behind their cameras they dont even really deserve a momentary thought let alone an actual you ive heard about filming people back if they do it to you though so maybe that will help i did once go to an event in a mostly normal outfit except for a plaid skirt and thigh highs and this photographer for a popular usbased online publication took a candid photo of me that ended up in their article i only ever found out because this girl from my school contacted me to ask about it it was kind of embarrassing because my facial expression was really silly im not upset but i really wish hed taken a nicer one or just asked first lol  a tactic i use is to try not to pay attention to people dont look at anyone for over 3 seconds dont listen in on people having bad hearing helps lmao just keep your eyes front and your mind on where youre going  it helps a lot to be with friends or family even if its just normie ones who are okay with your style
i wear classic and gothic lolita and i work at a really grimy backalley pub theres a lot of sort of questionable people among the regulars but surprisingly i havent had any big problems at all i do get comments but theyre mostly compliments i dont really own any clothes that arent lolita or at least jfashion so from the start i decided to dress like i normally do to work if not a bit toned down my boss hasnt mentioned anything about the clothes i wear so i think im good in that regard   walking across town at night by myself is a guarantee for cars/bikes stopping and drunk normies yelling though it doesnt stop me but it is somewhat offputting  when i started out wearing lolita id already worn alternative fashions ever since i left elementary school so i was very much used to not looking normal and being stared at because id always been weird my family and friends werent surprised or found it odd at all and that definitely helped making it feel wearable to me
i have very little self confidence in and out of lolitahow do i convince myself i dont look ugly as fuck and people are looking at me solely because i look ugly/have a weird face/look too old/  i wanna be a bad bitch gullsi wanna have confidence and walk around with the assurance of a true lady
  basically just stop caring put on clothes and stop focusing on the way you look sure make yourself presentable and do what you can to be your best you but just wear the fucking clothes and stop giving a shit about what other people may or may not think about your looks
  to expand on what  said i suggest you aim to look cute/beautiful/elegant for yourself first and foremost  whatever this means for you in lolita is entirely subjective and depending on what you do with your hair makeup styling etc you may or may not need to work on your appearance to improve it but the point is to make yourself feel beautiful for yourself not for anyone else  to illustrate this point objectively speaking i might not be a cute lolita some might even say im ugly but when i look in the mirror when im all dressed up i think i look cute as fuck and dont care what anyone else thinks this is the ultimate goal in this fashion imo to be beautiful for yourself so aim for that and your confidence will follow
      thank you for sharing
i want to start wearing lolita more often but i always feel like i need an occasion or some gathering im also scared people will see me differently mostly because im such a plain tomboy otherwise and im afraid the style will clash with their earlier perception of me too much
  needing to wear clothing can be a good excuse you just have to start wearing it i wear it out for grocery shopping going to the bank/post office/etc just put on the clothes the more you keep relying on having some sort of excuse for not wearing it the less youre going to wear it just do it anon
  doubt  i hope you are only pretending to be this thick and deluded
yesterday i celebrated ild wearing a full lolita coordinate out albeit toned down it was the first time i wore lolita outside of an event and by myself surprisingly it went very well i was in a crowded part of the city so i felt pretty safe a creepy guy whispered to me little cutie and i 100 ignored him and walked away that was the only unpleasant moment of the day other than that im very happy about it       i quote  on the occasion thing although i understand you while talking about   im also scared people will see me differently  can you accept not being 100 yourself to keep the image others have of you i decided i cant thats why i share lolita stuff on my facebook profile and dont try to hide my pictures in lolita but if you feel differently its still okay you should think about it and decide for yourself but the you who loves lolita is still you if someone really is your friend they will accept you anyway
  congratulations on your first day out anon i hope you wear lolita out more frequently it really is fun
if youre that scared of wearing it out why the fuck are you on /cgl/
  so they can change that if theyre in this thread or so they can pretend to be experts on the fashion despite the fact they dont wear it at all
  maybe theyre interested in it i know that i lurked cgl for years before i started wearing lolita
  actually why are you in this thread is your reading comprehension that broken that you cant understand what this is all about
  thank you very much im sure i will       maybe they wear lolita at conventions meets and tea parties like i did but not in everyday life
post the best  post the worst  post the most creative
self post as soldier mario and luigi made of felt cardboard paper and hot glue
selfpost did a crossplay with my boyfriend 2 years ago
  nice cross play really worked out you really pull off the androgynous boyish look well with the with and clothes and your guy nailed 11s thousand yard stare
self post husband isnt into cosplay but agreed to do caleb for my nott for our last big con poor dude got a cold so just doing the photos was more than enough since i figured he wouldnt leave the room most of con because of it
    this is hella cute
my boyfriend will cosplay with me for the first time at a con in january nurse joy  brock im super excited
  thank you it was fun to make felt is very obedient ive kinda stuck to cardboard and felt for most outfits to save on cash and time
  as much as i feel these two are a bit overrated as of late i will admit this is a bomb ass fuck cosplay and adore it i personally see susu as more of a morrigan but hey it still rocks
    im guessing they decided by breast size
  cute    my girlfriend and i are cosplaying as well in november    were doing an ancient magus bride cosplay shes going as chise and im going as elias im really excited  were the perfect height for the cosplay as well at 53 and 68 respectively    looking forward to getting pictures
    guy in the background is in absolute awe of his sword
    youre a big guy  i hope you arent a lanklet
  wow thats great  my manlet ass had to use drywall stilts or stand on a chair when we did amb
  nah i lift  i want to attempt an all might cosplay but im not bulky enough yet
would work as couples cosplay
      maybe the wrong place but you guys seem like you would know     my partner and i are thinking of going as megumin and kazuma from konosuba though both of us lack any creative skills what so ever and i was tasked in finding some online     do you guys have any suggestions for sites/shops/stuff to buy
  this honestly doesnt look like either of the characters if it wasnt for the banana and dr pepper i would have been guessing
how does one get a cosplay gf asking for a friend
  the two of them are so cute and susu is so talented but god damn does it make me sad how much she panders to her fat neckbeard male fanbase    i feel even their relationship panders sometimes
    the fact they both do lewd stuff with other girls makes me suspicious  like wouldnt a true lesbian couple only do stuff with each other
nursechan are you still there im still trying hard id still like it to happen
  aww phkun im still here and glad to see that youre doing your best are you also working on your cosplay or are you mostly focusing on getting fit for now
  its nice to see you again i have most of the materials and ive mentally planned how to do it including a cool method of seeing outside that should require minimal technical equipment  the only stuff left to decide on the cosplay is exactly how to do the sword while people have recommended eva foam for that too i dont want to use it as the core for it so im exploring options that will make the whole thing as consafe as possible while still looking as cool as we know it is itll probably be a wooden or aluminum core something that lets me screw the sword together even for easy storage and transport to give it enough strength to support the foam exterior  the only things i dont quite get is how to do the bloody/dirty appearance for the body makeup or what to use for the rugged cloth he wears    my training has been going really well and i already have a body that most regular people especially nerds consider fit well i had that for a while but now i think i have one but being /fit/ is harder  ill have completed one year of lifting around thanksgiving and im planning on going on a cut to finally show everything something early next year probably february or march    have you started any prep besides keeping me disciplined also i still hang out at the feels thread i think were just missing each other
  i dont come here very often so its definitely possible that were missing each other that said im so happy about this sounds like youve made a lot of progress   as for me ive got the basics ill need as in the garments shoes etc but theres still a lot of work ahead unfortunately life has gotten in the way recently and the most ive done beyond this is trying out tricks to achieve this cleavage not sure i can manage with the bust i have but attempts are being made nonetheless once i figure this out and shit settles down ill start working on the lovely bubble head
  ah ok thats great it sounds like you have most of the core of the look down actually as we get closer to next years cons well need to figure out how to do the blood and dirt the same way so we match  if you want im in the /facgl/ discord that gets passed around i joined because it was supportive of xboard trash like myself you can join too if you want to keep in contact a bit easier 
  given the context its suspicious as heck but poly/open lesbian couples exist
  the guy on the back is impressed
          cute
did a halloween costume with my gf my costume was eh her makeup was amazing
  okay but this is the cutest op great post great content i love it   i mean youre not wrong    bahaha this is fantastic     cute    idk you phkun but im very proud of you follow your dreams cosplay with nursechan i believe in you     do you have any better pics of her makeup it looks super cool id just like to see the textures and layering if possible

  did they do his stache well
    you get a gf and ask to do a couples cosplay
my friend and i were alolan red and green for halloween this year blocked out his face friends dont post friends on 4chan    also for the tall bf / small gf aesthetic banjo kazooie get that bitch on ya shoulders
  unfortunately we didnt take close ups of her face but heres something that may help
  its her second attempt the one with me is her third attempt but im sure theyre not too different
me and the gf and our first proper duo gundam mkii and the hyaku shiki fun and a crowd pleaser but not too practical this was megacon a few years ago and with the crowds we didnt get any further into the show proper than about 50 ft from the elevator
  more recent girls und panzer duo we did working on making some other gup costumes for us built around go carts
  you will never have an asian gf cosplaying kiki with you
  sorry to be that guy but the girl in the op is more cute desu
  cringe
  wow that girl is beautiful
  agreed
  tbh i think they look great
  maybe but both are still cute tho

  yeah but the guy in op is also more cute so it balances out
can u help me identify who these characters are      please and thank you
  low budget roman torchwick    also sage for not using the catalog
i dont think this topic exists way to assume tho

saló del manga 2018 barcelona
any comments about the winners
hola enki
let this thread die in peace
  i liked the winners

this year the thread is on foro cosplay
  the mentalista deleted it i think
0 risk bad quality costumes and the winners are staff of ficomic they are mc really tongo
  but thats not their fault its ficomics
nobody else should go to wcs in spain if ficomic allows people from the staff participate in their competitions and also win them
  que si enki que estás dolido
why jojos win the contest monster hunter and one piece were better in costumes and perfomance
rasetes win summit
itnit true that the winners were ficomic staff stop spreading fake news
ecg was short but great pirates of caribbean shocked me wcs not at all akira was nice jojos great but not the best and mario was funny too  cccc meh where i can find videos
  they might not have a role every year within ficomic but they have been collaborating with them and even talk daily to people such as graciela its the same of always amiguismo  cosplay is not enough serious for them so they dont give a fuck about it so they let tongo happen
im sad enki deleted the post  he was my new hero but now he is just another attention whore
  
    
no more salseo
old thread     ems airmail and sal are officially not shipping by japan post to canada right now        merry fucking christmas
god i fucking hate public sector unions and this socialist dystopia we have created with them
  there are private couriers pluck your panties out of your asshole and use dhl if youre so bothered
have you been living under a rock this is old news     albeit im annoyed with the strikes i sympthize with the workers postal workers have very high work accident rates during this time of year
  boo fucking hoo they already have benefits and higher wages theyre compensated fairly the unions just have a huge fucking stick up their ass
  theyve been trying to reach agreements for a year and this was a move they thought they had to take its not like they started striking on day one of this disagreement not to mention that the government is probably going to issue a backtowork to them before the month is over since the post is considered an essential service    yeah its been a few weeks of inconvenience and will be a few more while they catch up but its been a year of negotiations behind the scenes
  no they dont read into it before you repeat boomer logic     parcel deliveries have increased a ton with online shopping but despite the biggest workload they arent getting compensated for it as much they are striking for better pay when being forced overtime or stopping the overtime and hiring more and better accident benefits     canada post is a crazy profitable company but treats their employees like trash because its an essential service
  plus its not even fullon strike but a rotating one theyre just working regular hours rather than doing overtime its the compagny that was locking them out the previous weeks but the post is still moving just very slowly unfortunately combined with the influx of holiday packages this has turned into a massive backlog       leglisated back to work   this is kind of unfortunate since the holidays is really when they have the most momentum strike in the summer and no1currs
while im sympathetic to the postal workers they gave me a mini heart attack while i was waiting for cosplay supplies and cut down on the time i had to prepare said cosplay so im kind of annoyed with them its frustrating how neither side is willing to budge but im sure the workers will end up screwed by back to work legislation at some point
these fricking fricks better stop fricking around an bring me my god damn fricking brand you corporate pigs
  its okay anon you can say fuck your parents arent watching
im torn because i support the union and their right to strike but also my ss marked down my package to avoid customs and im positive my burando is gonna get lost in the millions of unsorted shit
you do know one of the major reasons they are striking the company wants a two tier wage scale so all new employs will never makeor have the same benefits as current workers  its not even about the money they will sign a contract with pay where it will be first year will be 1 second year 1 year three will be 1 and year four will be 2 for a 5 wage increase over 4 years
  youre free to use a private courier fuck off
      here was their offer that the post turned down you can actually see what is being done
itt seagulls go full /pol/ on each other
for those that are looking for uptodate information on the postal strike id recommend liking the page the local post advisor they changed the name for some reason previously something like cupw its the vancouver local unions page i followed them years ago when there were talks about a strike but it never happened 2015 2016 or you can try to find your own locals page    they post relevant news super quickly and of course discuss what is going on internally for workers i dont work for the union but i run an online store so i try to keep up to date with everything since it affects me they also post which area is on strike every single day from the rotating strikes      i really hope they can negotiate a fair contract i really really dont like their current ceo if he had his way cp would become completely private and profit driven which is disgusting for an essential service you can see how this has worked for bc ferries which is now treated like a tourist attraction instead of a necessity for islanders to reach the mainland and vice versa if you thought cp pricing for parcels was ridiculous now i couldnt imagine what would happen if they became private
check the mail  christmas gift for my grandmother has arrived even though the shipping never updated  feels amazing as i was so worried that hers wouldnt get here  open up package so i can gift wrap it  sent the wrong item  why even bother living anymore
i thought this was /cgl/
    apparently international parcels may experience delays into march 2019
  what the fuck thats ridiculous
  this sucks for everyone now the workers have been fucked over and we still have to deal with the backlog because theres no incentive to do the catchup
any news on when japan post is going to start even shipping to canada again    im worried im not going to be able to order any lucky packs the one time i can finally afford them
  supposedly theyre going to start allowing international orders in in 2 weeks or so
    it is i just found the announcement canada post made about it     i guess we can only pray that theyre exaggerating
  i mean i can see it the holiday season has backlog without strikes so striking probably added a few weeks i remember some of the items i ordered on 1111 last year took literally 2 months to arrive
will china post still ship to canada i want to do a taobao order reeeeeee
  they wont youd have to get your shopping service to send to you through dhl
things i ordered months ago before the whole canada post strike is still not here  imagine my shock
  i had a package sent through japan post today
  reeee i just put in a spreenow order 2 days ago  dhl is so expensive rip
uuuuaaghhhuuhaahhuuggguuuuuahaaaagghhhhhhhhhh
    alarmist nonsense    i ordered from japonica and while the shipment took an unusually long time to actually leave japan once it shipped out it arrived in canada and then my house in one week i then ordered from korea and the us and both have arrived without much delay meanwhile my order from a canadian retailer has been delayed since nov 14th i think international shipments are fine
  tell that to wunderwelt i ordered a sock lot and they sent me an email saying that if they shipped now there would be a good chance japan post would just send it back to them they requested i wait a few days and hold the items with them
  my package was held by japan post for about a week i was worried they would send it back but i havent actually heard that happen to anyone ive only heard japanese sellers warn about it     my package was around 40k not marked down and dodged customs it could be that theyre sending back smaller packages but sending through the ones with higher shipping fees or that take up more space im sort of worried now because i already have another order of jewelry piling up
  im still waiting on a small epacket parcel from closet child its been over a month pretty sure its stuck on our side in customs right now
what do you guys think of gamexpo
costumes seem really basic shit even normal competitions have more complicated ones heres the best cosplayers of finland
how big is the community in finland particularly for lolita t curious burger
  i would say decent but nothing like in us helsinki attracts around 20 attendees regularly and other cities max 10 but most bigger cities have some kind of community not everyone goes to meets though i would say finnish comm is really laid back so thats not the problem with small attendance
   that manlet soldier 76 in the backround
  lonelita here how accepting of newbies are you guys especially in helsinki does an inside type of group/comm already exist or is it easy to get in as someone whos never been to a meet before im always lurking the meets group on fb but have never had the courage to attend
    nayrt btw
sorry to say it but i dont really like having cosplay contests outside anime conventions i feel like the anime label keeps normies out gamexpo is basically an event for little boys and also more commercial type of event i hope next sm is somewhere else
yeah i feel like conventions are safe space without judgement and place like gamexpo it is just weird and i dunno plus mostly only the people competing dress up for the event
  theres also the circus animal aspect these esport events just want cosplayers to be some kind of decorations im not blaming them for that but its not a place for a contest like this just get some booth babes instead
does anyone even care about the sm i only see maybe 1020 people talking about it nobody else gives a shit and barely knows it exists
do finnish people care about anything with this scale i dont think hype isnt even a thing people do its just the whole thing with expo that people dont take it seriously also i feel like the competition should be like invitation only and with costumes they have already made
  contests are always full of drama and the winner can always be predicted beforehand so why would anyone care about contests anymore in the sm contest your big prize is to get to represent finland in a mediocre contest and the winner of the group series is left with almost no prize at all the sm contest is a joke and it would not be made any better by invitation crap
  helsinki or generally im not really part of the helsinki community but i would say you will be welcomed and manage if you are ready to put effort into getting to know people there are few cliques but also lovely people who try to take newbies into account overall the finnish community is pretty easy to get in if you dont expect others to take you in and once you figure out how the comm works i mean all the groups and stuff my personal experience was really good but it has been years and things have changed but i still would definitely recommend you to try
the sms have always been shitty and mediocre at best it doesnt even deserve the title suomen mestaruus something needs a change
  except anime conventions are full of normies already anyway
  i think its less about normies coming to cons and more just the fact that a lot of 20something animefans have grown out of anime itself but still go to cons to meet their friends especially with desucon but even tracon had people just going to nearby parks to get drunk with friends rather than actually spending time at the con im personally a little put off by that since you can go drink and party with friends literally whenever so id like if cons focused more on the actual hobby aspect instead of serving booze and dropping thousands of euros in the afterparty instead of the actual program desucon especially has lost its way a bit in regards to this theres still no info on who the goh at frostbite will be and every single announcement and signup has come out of nowhere and often a little late too i think it was the same with talks this year a shame really since theres no other animeonly centered con in finland
  to kind of add to the latter point im sure that organizing three events per year of which two are 3day conventions is exhausting and the organizers and staff arent always going to be on top of their game because of it but i really dont see a problem with having a gap year with events if it gets that tough i understand maybe having the summer desucon every year but doing talks and maybe even frostbite biyearly isnt a bad thing if it ensures that the quality improves considering desucon has always been really prideful in regards to how well their events are run theres no reason to run themselves to the ground by piling on more work than necessary not to mention both cons are k18 so its not like there will be pikkuernuja wholl throw a temper tantrum for frostbite not being organized since theyll be at yukicon instead anyway and im sure a lot of adults can deal with one less event every now and then cause its not like you can automatically go every time anyway because of work and money  tldr desucon should stop throwing money at booze and after parties in order to attract attendees and actually do a proper job with the con even if it means less events per year
  youre right but its not as bad as esports exhibition which is already targeted at normies
  is it because the conventions arent trying enough or because the older generation no longer cares or doesnt have enough time to care about anime stuff and the younger generation never went through the major weeb phase so they have different kind of interests than anime its hard to make anime related content if people arent just interested in delivering it since it has always been by fans for fans i dont think anyone in finland vlogs about anime either and the thing is that the younger people are more interest in that type of interaction     id say fashion and beauty related things are still popular though kbeauty and a few vloggers definitely have something to do with that    by the way the guest of honor was just announced its scipt writer dai sato
  i do think you have a point since it is a fact that anime itself is less of a hobby for people and these days its more fandom stuff in general or normie tier ironic weeb stuff without actually being that heavily invested in anime but i do also think that finlands only anime convention making a bigger fuss about ryybs  iltabileet than their own program doesnt help the case   im sure there are still people interested in anime and even hosting a panel about it but theres more pressure these days to do a more general type of program rather than of a specific series/franchise/studio for example since it seems more common these days to only watch whatever is popular and other series arent worth the time i think it would be good to encourage people to even just come talk about their favorite anime ever rather than let them think they have to have insane pp skills and invent the wheel and talk about something that touches the whole scene and no one has ever heard of before i also think more variety in the goh programs would be desirable qa is good but if the guest is interested in hosting their own panel or comp or anything really do let them its a shame to fly them over to finland only to have them appear a couple short times
  nayrt but it might also be that people have begun seeking more enjoyment from cons goh programs and iltabileet are things that cannot be easily replicated in daily life but the con lectures are basically just nerds googling stuff and presenting it as a lecture if youre heavily invested in an anime/phenomena you will most likely do your own background research and talk about it with your friends anyway noone here works in the animeindustry so everyone is just getting their information from the internet/other published sources which are available to anyone whoso wishes which is why i agree that more goh programs would be great since those people are actual professionals with experience and firsthand knowledge not just finnish weebs reading a bunch of blogs and articles online    also just a personal opinion but seeing how easy it is to throw together a lecture for the con has really turned me away from them obviously some people are more dedicated than others and do amazing lectures but you can get the general conlectureexperience with a few friends that are invested on researching stuff and discussing it on their own group chat
  but seeing how easy it is to throw together a lecture for the con has really turned me away from them  i used to go to listen any lectures that sounded even a bit interesting but now i just go with those that really interest me the quality has gone down really fast i know everyone is a hobbyist but many lectures are like school powerpoint presentations something you had to make for free pass and quality doesnt matter
  i have to disagree but maybe ive just been lucky
  i think its kind of the point of cons to get to listen to that geeky rambling even if you can get the same from talking with friends i also like to go listen about studios/series that im not personally super familiar with in case ill find something new to watch in which case all of the information is new to me but i do think its good to have other types of program too i just hope its not at the expense of these types of lectures like i have absolutely nothing against iltabileet or even serving booze at the venue but i dont think they should be the main event in an anime con i personally prioritize goh programs but other than that most of my time is spent at these types of lectures because i just genuinely like listening to people who are passionate about the same things as i am and sometimes you even have time to chat the person up during/after the presentation which is nice  also so far i havent really seen half assed presentations obviously there are people who arent wizards at pp and dont have much experience at talking in front of crowds but i can forgive that as long as theyre genuinely trying but then again its possible that we go for lectures about different subjects in the first place so your mileage may vary
  noone here works in the animeindustry so everyone is just getting their information from the internet/other published sources which are available to anyone whoso wishes  however some of this information is so all over the place and sometimes there are language barriers as well so the point of doing representation is to gather it in one nice package and present it to the people who come to listen there are also subjects that might not interest someone at all but once they go to listen to the lecture they get interested in it of course this cant happen if people are like this subject doesnt interest me at all so i wont even waste my time    its good to keep in my mind that in the end conventions are just amateur events except sct events that are supposed to be professional the point of them is to share your passion towards something
  and then theres sometimes deeper analysis you couldnt necessarily find online as its presented there the age of blogs was different and some of the best panels would have made great blog posts in my opinion    some panels really arent that good though yes but i think naming names which con which panel would help everyone in staying on the same page i personally dont see the decline of panels as that big of an issue and i wonder if its because i simply go to different ones
  how delusional and/or retarded do you have to be to believe they think the afterparty is the highlight of the event i have never gotten that vibe the afterparty is more like an additional event a lot of people dont really care about the gohs are clearly the part where most of the effort and money goes other cons just dont have the connections to publishers etc that animecon has so its a lot harder for them to get an actual professional from the anime industry to guest
  i agree last desucon didnt even have enough performers a month before the con and before that they were searching for someone to organize the whole thing sure there are people who are most vocal about the partying thing but that wouldnt change even without the afterparty
  the reason i mentioned the after party etc is because of stuff like making a huge deal in their twitter about dropping 5k for the after party budget with zero mention about how much goes into other aspects spending more time advertising/asking for input regarding playlists/performers at the afterparty than most other things obviously a lot of fault lies in the fact that different people are in charge of different things but i think someone should then be in charge of making sure that all aspects of the con get an equal amount of exposure with gohs getting even more than others and literally spending more time and effort introducing their biletiimi at avajaiset than their fucking guests_of_honor or the lecture based program that the whole event originally was based on an afterparty has always been a part of cons but it hasnt always been k18 and it most definitely hasnt always been such a big fucking deal i think an age restricted con is a good idea just not when it literally translates to same shit but now with less of the old and with booze this time so im not really surprised when other anons think cons are full of normies now when compared to before  also its pretty ridiculous to think my problem was that they organize an afterparty when the point was that i dont want the con to use it as a cheap way to get attendees and thus not have to worry about the quality of the rest of the event you could change the afterparty to quite literally anything else possible like come check out our con for the sick hentai we sell at the dealers and the complaint would be the same advertising for the lowest common denominator instead of the from fans for fans attitude they used to have although even advertising cartoon porn is more relevant to the theme than ryybs ja bileet so there you go
  ah i see youre retarded
  feel free to point out where what i said was wrong and i will gladly admit to being a retard
  i dont agree with everything that person said either but resorting to name calling just derails the conversation
alright since were currently discussing desucon and the programming anyway what are your first impressions on frostbites program better or worse than previously
  about the same     there are some panels that immediately jump to me from the program isao takahata classic manga to modern anime anime studios and bankruptcy some that dont personally interest me at all and most somewhere inbetween     a bit disappointed that goh is at the same time as eunyoung choi panel but guess you cant have it all
  pretty alright also nice to see unreality performing in desucon
    definetly an improvement a lot of stuff i want to hear masculinity johatsu internet subcultures 3gatsu no lion cape quiz etc
it feels that every time someone dares to say some criticism about desucon conventions there is instantly great amount of people defending desucon desucon has branded themselves as great convention with good quality lectures but that is not guarantee that everything is that great as they say    please take feedback and dont get so defensive every convention has something they have to improve
  so we should just let people spread rumours like the one of the after party budgeting above if you have valid crtisism and present it to the organizers they will most likely take it and improve if its legit and usable if you write it here you should be prepared to discuss it because its only natural not everyone will agree and its how this place kinda functions discussing things like program is super subjective and people want to voice their own experience
  if you pull some kind of claim out of your ass you need to be prepared to defend your stance often criticism towards desucon is about the budget and often its also simply wrong
  people make up absurd rumors and get shot down  oh i see we cant criticize desucon at all  grow the fuck up please
  i love how ironic it is that this post immediately got replies that were also from the desucon defense force you can like something and also want it to improve by pointing out what you feel can be improved but obviously thats too hard to grasp      the budget thing isnt a rumor from the ass maybe do your research before blindly defending whatever it is you feel to need to defend
  the budget thing isnt a rumor from the ass maybe do your research before blindly defending whatever it is you feel to need to defend  oh yes believing anything on an anonymous image board supplying absolutely no sources is not blind faith at all anon    the afterparty team walking on the stage during the opening ceremony to tell about the event is not proof lmao
  what are you on about its one thing if you dont follow desucons twitter or just didnt pay attention/ dont remember the tweet but sometime during the organizing of a previous years event cant remember wether is was frostbite or summer desu desucon retweeted a tweet by the afterparty organizer mentioning that they got given a 5000 euro budget for the afterparty its possible that the tweet got deleted because after a quick search i couldnt find it then again twitter has the most rubbish search ive ever encountered but when it was tweeted i even had a talk with about it with others because we found it a weird thing to point out because no other parts of the budget have been publicly mentioned before  its actually a bit silly to defend desucon that hard if you arent even that familiar with them not to mention that if you think theres nothing wrong with having an afterparty then obviously you wouldnt be bothered about them having a high budget so why the need to desperately claim that its bullshit in the first place i dont really understand why so many people here feel the need to latch onto any negative comment or negative in this case toward desucon when literally any other con can be shat on with no repercussion just let people complain if they feel like it or at least offer some proof yourself why their complaints are baseless if youre so intent on trying to prove a point
  im not disagreeing with what you say but the criticism involving lectures is often rather vague and i dont think anyone gets anything out of that     the lectures were not as good as they shouldve been doesnt say awfully lot but dropping specific examples and elaborating on them helps its a lot easier to take feedback if you actually understand what the feedback is about
  idk but that doesnt really sound too high so do you have any sources how much other cons budget for them you have absolutely nothing to back up your claims
  in the post youre replying to it wasnt necessarily a question of if its high or not and even then it doesnt matter what other cons give as a budget but how much of the budget is spent on other parts of the con in comparison     why is everyone so hung up on about the budget thing anyway it had fuck all to do with the argument which was that desucon has been getting sloppy with their organizing and the original post used the afterparty as an example of focusing on the wrong things the budget tweet was just an example of many and to be fair something no one actually seems gives a fuck about why on earth are there people talking like mentioning the budget tweet is supposedly some huge rumor meant to destroy desucons reputation when even the post that originally mentioned it didnt pay that much attention to it i literally cant understand why its suddenly some big talk of the thread and especially when reading through the posts it looks like no one even understand whats going on either because everyone is just spewing some bullshit about that they think is going on when in reality there is nothing to it theres maybe three people in the whole thread who are not about the budget and are actually having a converstation and are on the same page the rest are for some ungodly reason arguing over a single thing that everyone apparently needs to have an opinion about but no one can understand what the other actually said
  desucon retweeted a tweet by the afterparty organizer mentioning that they got given a 5000 euro budget for the afterparty  afterparty and normal saturday party are two completely different things and that money was for the saturday party 5000 is nothing for reserving a club for private use
desucon  bunch of miserable adults who think desucon is the most epic because no kids allowed  said miserable adults spend all con just drinking and gossiping    why are people afraid of kids who go to conventions to actually have fun
  can you actually drink in the area i might consider going if its allowed
  not to mention that if you think theres nothing wrong with having an afterparty then obviously you wouldnt be bothered about them having a high budget  a high budget  they claimed its high and i asked for proof i do think its a matter how much other cons spend on it of course along the other budgeting you mentiod because without that we have no comparison if its high or not and the anon themselves decided to continue only from the point of after party rumouring     i dont care for desucon but i have been there and i honestly think its stupid to come here and basically say the lectures are worthless and major chunk of the budget is used for afterparty without anything to back this critisism then crying when nobody agrees why not find something that can actually be backed up desucon is not my cup of tea at all but i can still be objective on my critismsm of the con
  you can drink in the restaurant area where you buy your drinks you cant bring your drinks or drink anywhere else but im pretty sure some people do it anyway
does anyone know how reporting someone to con authorities works i mean if a person is a potential threat with past problems with getting physically violent at conventions and has many people who hate them could they be banned for that
  most likely not literally anyone could be blamed for something without proof
  nayrt but they said     with past problems with getting physically violent at conventions     maybe they would have some proof of this
  unless theres actual proof such as a police report no the con cant do anything i know of one case that resulted in a ban when they hit someone at the convention and there were multiple people witnessing it another one got banned when they harassed girls and one of the victims took it to court you might be able to ask them to keep an eye on that person and give them a heads up though
  sounds like something a kid whos salty they cant get in would say
  the one that was taken to court also had the person harassing cosplayers online so there was actual documentation of it
  thank you i might do that the person in question is someone with a massive ego who has harassed and manipulated lots of people and has left said people feeling like cons arent safe places to be a lot of you might know and have personal experiences with this person no names outed because this thread could be deleted for that
  i think i know who youre talking about and i wish she realized nobody wanted her psycho ass around
  as previously said the con cant do anything because of laws the cons are public events and cant ban someone because they have done something outside the con on top of that the tickets are not personal and it would be hard to enforce but if they are threathening to hurt you at the con you could always show screenshots to the staff at the con or on the conventions social media in a private message and they can keep an eye on the person as well as getting a number to the safety personell if anything were to go wrong
i personally have experience with someone who was more an annoyance than threat because this person was just following me and my friend around without asking and being kind of weird not sure if they had some kind of legit autism most of the con goers are normal and cool people but then theres always that one person who takes your energy when you try your best avoiding them
is the person someone that even strangers should feel threatened about or 
  i dont think theres currently anyone in the community whos known for harrassing random people whenever theres a problem with someone being abusive or just an ass they tend to target those they know beforehand of course if youre a qt girl or a guy why not then do take care because there have been rare cases of perverts secretly taking upskirt shots etc and sometimes people get really touchy feely at cons with strangers for some inane reason if you do however get unlucky enough to get harrassed by someone whether theyre genuinely trying to hurt you mentally or physically or just make you uncomfortable by being needlessly touchy/flirty and dont take the hint that you dont want them there then please go report them to the security guards thats what theyre there for and they will help you out
  maybe not threatened just be cautious this could be connected to the person mentioned but generally if someone random comes to talk to you and is almost overly nice and kind you should expect that theyre manipulating you into giving them something a place to stay for the con night for example
    yeah there are many people like this at cons i think its just the way it is  socially awkward nerds dont know when to stop talking or when theyre overstepping boundaries sometimes you gotta be direct to them even though it might feel a bit bad    that being said if someone feels threatening definitely contact the security or häirintäyhdyshenkilö if you feel so thank god finnish con scene has a very small number of harassers
has anyone heard anything about heroes comic con helsinki saw somewhere this year that the one in helsinki was going to be new the other comic cons in europe looked pretty good
what were they thinking when they designed these lolita brand fails thread
every ap x disney release ever
  why it has to be brand i have over 100 images of taobao lolita fail
  because taobao already has a reputation for shit quality
  idk man i thought ap x disney op was really cute
this makes me wanna barf
this always makes me kek  these retarded cats are a classic
hoo boy i have a bunch that come to mind looking at you ap
  this colorway im sure its lovely in person but it looks like a bad lacemonster
ap confirmed makes horrible dresses
  i hated this series the print design was fine but the colorways were horrendous
this meta take on the pretty in pink prom dress
  i love this one not gonna lie but i understand why you hate it
i always think these are wine labels
hideous both the colour and the boobless cut
  aw i like this one esp this color
  the cut of this is lovely i bet it looks great worn
big ass flag
pepperoni pizza dress
worst leopard dress
never 4get
who is this for
baby is not without sin
  brexit bear  im going to puke for real
  i think the cut is really cute for more laid back coordinates or hot weather      remember when this was really popular its still pretty ugly though
and its worse in green
that nasty satin ribbon
  oh no i love this what is the print called
  candy shower   some of the pieces of this print are genuinely cute as heck but the op is trash anon stay away
      im the only person in the world who likes this print
  i actually like british bear but those colorways are terrible
  this thread got me looking at the old wtfburnado livejournal heres a post from it
this could have been beautiful without the bright fucking pink lace
  most likely that thing is an eye sore
  nah im loving it if only the cut was better ive wear it and be trashy
  i love it its not really something i would wear but i think its adorable and looks really cute in real life
    me too anon picked some really unfirtunate cut pinafore jsk looks much better not sure if i wear it either but its actually cute
  this reminds me of ms frizzle
  the best part about candy shower is the smiley gumball i love based meta
speaking of ap x disney yikes
  yeah but it would be fun to see some of the really wtf and funny stuff
            i never seen any of these dresses sold on any second hand sites have they all been eliminated
    if you told me these were lolita cosplays from milanoo id believe you especially the first one       this looks like babbys first attempt at handmade lolita
  man this would be great if it wasnt a print i really like the bodice chiffon and scalloping but that mismatched print throws me off
  someone bought them all and burned them dresses eliminated
  this looks surprisingly nice irl
      you might as well post the most hilarious ones op started well and then kind of went off into ranting about prints they dont like    i really miss wtfburando at least there was some actual really fugly stuff on there both the lj and the tumblr    contributing with some old jane marple wtf
  i was wondering what pink lace  then i realized thats not a print    thats nauseating      i actually really like this but its one of my favorite color combos
  god i actually like this kind of what is it called
  i actually think this is cute i miss their older aesthetic
remember when we had to post disclaimers not to just dump meta photos but now its mostly ap
cone of shame is a classic
  shame cute cut
  i hate this one but it always makes me think of like blood and pus not pizza lol
  ewokkei
  patriotic witch    this is great though
  good
  i want it my ita is calling sauce
my reaction to all these dresses thus far
    it doesnt actually look like that in person the yellow is much more muted in real life more like mustard yellow
when everyone thought this was from hot topic  colorway muthafucking shrek
  the chinese anon
  this makes me scream jesus christ
  i love aatp but their weird collages of random pics prints like this are always pretty shitty got a similar one in a lucky pack and ive never touched it      this rules though      i regret not buying this when it was on sale its kind of cute in an ugly way i dig it
  what  are you doing   in my swamp
i like this print but already can predict some nasty pickup lines like one would wear this because they wanted to get laid honestly what was ap thinking of like we dont have to deal with predators already
  gotta cater to the ageplayers
  not sure about the pink one but ive seen the white one irl and ive gotta agree with 
  excuse you but as an ageplayer that print is not anything im remotely interested in
     its just a bed print how is it sexy or catering to ageplayers
  i still like ita looking lacemonsters from the day of old i always wanted some of them to be well made this is for those of us that are nostalgic for itakei
  just ignore it they probably dont even wear lolita literally no one else has thought that
  two of them are on closetchild right now    sweet madeline op    also forgot this one good idea bad choice of tartan
  gtfo this is a great print its not ageplayer i smell a lolita roleplayer
  the print is such a cliche but at least it looks better qualitywise than the usual cheap polyester disney collabs
  i love this dress and would wear the shit out of it i find it tastefully gaudy
  same      confession ive never like their combination of black and royal blue
  i have this dress and it is awesome iws stock pictures are just the worst
  that awkward center seam
  only pedophiles sleep in beds
  i just hate all halterneck jsks in general
  pics
  have there ever been any photos of someone actually wearing this
  can anyone confirm whether the lace on this is that obnoxious or are aps photos are just bad
  ew
      i didnt mean it to be age play catering its more about basic catcalling that one may face in public beds have something to do with sex and if someone is already going to say shit it may give extra topic i would be glad if you reconvince me back i actually like that print
  lmao i understand this  vaguely on topic i was wearing normie clothes out and had a keychain on my bag of the jiggy from banjo kazooie just a puzzle piece  and a random stranger approached me and said some shit like you have the missing piece to my heart and pointed to the keychain
  i love this desu kms
  anderson tartan is hilariously gaudy
  if the top was just a bit different i love stuffykei    seconding pics
  its actually on my wishlist
  its delightfully tacky i bought it in yellow and blue at the summer sale
i actually like so many of these
  this has such an otome feel to me i actually like this
  shows how much you know about sex most people that cat call dont care about a bed being involved they want to bend you over right then and there
  a girl in my comm has a different cut of that print and i think its adorable
 mam what is you doing bby
  this one upsets me the most because aatp  peter pan could have looked incredible this was their weird muddy watercolor phase though right
  it was only popular because iw were at the tpc event in london that year and this was their newest print people bought it to wear all at once
  i didnt know vioretta was back up for sale i cant believe they added this abomination instead of rereleasing the black one im heartbroken
      the pinafore looks cute here but i want to see worn pics the jsk and op with all of the solid reds and wide stripe and thin stripeits like they couldnt decide which ribbons to use and so theyre all there its jarring
  i would have loved a rerelease of the black one this one had the potential to be a gorgeous release but that bright lace ruined it im wondering though if the lace is actually that color or if they just take horrible photos and shopped it poorly
  bringing this back
  what the fuck is that
  bitch dont tempt me
  it was posted to btb a few years ago i keep it saved for special occasions
  its a bed     aatp has released some real fuckin winners over the years     this looks like when spongebob and patrick word sandys fur while she was hibernating holy shit jm    oh god i hated this when it came out i cant believe everyone was losing their shit over it     this is a clusterfuck but i like it     girls with more money than taste desu   meta what the actual fuck
  yeehaw
  i hope they went all out and paired it with this
  so try  onions tr  nothing about these can be saved
  too bad the shape of shoe is most fitting for lolita i wish they started making solid shoes one day
i really hate the ap x dokuhime collab the dresses look like cheap babby first sewing project and the materials used arent fitting at all it just gives off a completely different vibe its such a shame especially considering that the outfits were designed by mitsukazu mihara and arent impossible to pull off  sorry for terrible quality lolibrary isnt working for me
  i love the dokuhime outfits this is sad
used to think this was okay until seeing it irl its so cheap looking in person
      looks like the fucking carpet at a bowling alley    would be nice if they got the right frame for it    needs more pineapple    i love the piss coloured one    box of tissues    when you as big as a house you may as well wear one    nightclub wallpaper    do they say andy on the bottom tho
  when did they do this collab i loved dokuhim how the hell did i miss this
all i can say about this is why      i second this it isnt worth the money in person i was so in love with it it was my ultimate dream dress but i sold it immediately because it just wasnt the standard i usually hold these releases to be no regrets tho
  it was in 2013 i believe
  never seen this in person did anyone even buy it ive never seen even rich chinese lolitas flaunting it and thats obviously the target market for this
  i want this but im always so sleepy that id just be reminded of how tired i am and id go home to sleep
  gosh this would be dd material if they removed all the extraneous bows and netting and shit i love the cut
  anon thats adorable
  thanks anon  the beds look so comfy im getting tired just looking at it
  the tassels at the bottom lmao
  same anon it would be a cute halloween coord
  i kind of like this bows netting and all sue me
   i actually really like this one too i can see how it wouldnt be for everyone though
  do they say andy on the bottom tho  of course youre paying for the details after all
  oh hell yeah
never 4get
  somebody once told me
  dont forget the other one
  i love this tangerine nightmare
found on yauctions what in the flying fuck meta
  the dress just has beds on it its not that deep i swear some gulls come up with the most perverted shit from thin air
  wow this would match so well with that piss yellow brittish bear dress
this print is so fucking ugly    the shoes the tulle the leopard print why
  seriously literally no one thinks that when they see a bed print some normie may joke about getting ready for sleep but not about getting plowed into i bet that anon is also afraid of their own shadow
  i would be fine with this if it wasnt for the little shoe front and center i like shoes and all but when i see people using them as like a logo or personal symbol it just screams narcissism to me   also lolitas dont even wear stilettos with lolita
  i like the centre shoe i liked it less when i saw the other cuts and realised that the centre shoe was more of an accident and you could end up getying a dress that has half a shoe or a 1/4 rose across your tits
  this is so cute its one of the few lolita dresses that actually feel current to actual fashion trends
  here i just saw this on my dashboard its a denim jsk by sibyl heise and yes i would still find this hideous if it was something a brand did i could absolutely see meta doing it desu
  i liked it but i also own jewel leopard soooo
  dont rib on the denim jsk its glorious
  sure if you want to look like youre wearing a cowgirl costume made for a 4 year old
  costume for a 4 year old  it looks nothing like that
  n isnt backwards  throw them in the trash
 i think you meant 
  idk about yall but ive never seen a child wear a full denim dress since the early 2000s unless its overalls of course
  super tacky ap needs other inspo than ripping off other brands they can do so much better
  who are they ripping off
  meta duh
  im a ride or die meta fangirl but they didnt invent leopard print anon come on
  i love meta and am the anon from earlier who owns jewel leopard and while i agree they didnt invent leopard print  could totally be a meta print
  didnt this come out like 5 years ago hardly jumping on a trend
im too lazy to look up the actual name but this disgusting thing from btssb hurts my eyes any time it pops up
  and people think haenulis torsos are long lol
  nah metas shit is even uglier than that
  thats just a dropped waist cut anon you can see the waistties on the places where the actual smallest part of the waist sits
  this
  i would like it without the shoes the high heel motif reminds me of little girls dress up accessories idolizing heels bitch this is lolita fashion we are all old enough to wear real heels
  are other brands not allowed to use leopard print im confused the dresses aesthetics and styles are nothing alike besides the leopard print
    a cowgirl lolita cord could be really cute actually has anyone done this
i knew i had pretty terrible taste in dresses  and  are both on my wishlist but  and  really threw me off i figured liking/owning those two were proof that my tastes might still be saved i guess its time to fully embrace being awful
  tfw getting this dress in the mail today     i fucking love it but i agree the shoe right in the middle blows gonna wait till the resale value drops to 10000 yen and buy one
  which color way anon we can twin    _ツ_/
as a baby indie brand this thread makes me feel a lot better about my work
  it just got worse btw
  i love it so much
  nah i love meta too but it looks more like ap is just jumping on the current normie trend for leopard print
  based meta    my favourite old meta print is this one biscuit print i think its fugly as shit and for some reason i just adore it
  theyre all tackycute but i actually really love the black jsk
  ikr me too its in the mail to me rn missing the removable collar though so its not ideal the white one is on mercari aswell i think
  agreed i couldnt believe it wasnt by some terribad indie brand when i saw bbs day of the dead coord looking at it makes me nauseous
  this is actually bomb if it were meta however the dotted tulle on the straps would most certainly be removable making this perfect
  i love this fashion so effing much
  im 100 here for this
  i want to see somebody wear this in r/l so bad now
  are you me bless you anon the constant sleepiness struggle is real
houndstooth print  thats a no from me capn
  this could have been cute in a thicker nicer material bummer
  this is so incoherent its like someone made a random dress generator
  is it sad that i really love the shape of this
  tacky hell yes   but my heart i love this its an abomination and i fucking love it     bonnet    okay but this is a decently organized coord for that release
   no no it couldnt the houndstooth would look bad with the giant print sections regardless one or two sweets appliques would be cute but this design is gross
  i saw this dress so many times since the thread was created i began liking it
  i love this but it needs a cowboy hat instead of a boater hat
  honestly its a dream print of mine and i dont even like sweet
    i thought the shape has always been fine just something about the fabric thickness and the chest collar always suggested this dress is made from the original practical kind of denim ie rock hard upholstery fabric it doesnt look comfortable and i wouldnt want to buy it just to check whether its comfortable to wear or not then on top of that the model pics kind of fail of make the idea of farm work look glamourous/whimsical/cute something about the hillbillyish design of the dress seems to make it say hello i shovel cow poop in this dress cos thats what cowhands do and like thanks but i didnt get into lolita to look like an overdressed manual labourer with mud and poop on my cowgirl boots    unless youre talking about the oversized floppy boob bow in  boob bows were bad enough when ap was making them its equally bad when its denim and actually looks like its flopping across your boobs
    it looks better as a pastel mush i think
  the construction is very good but jean fabric sucks
    the pastel versions look fine but the contrast from the black and white houndstooth combined with the pastel sweets print is way too busy
  ap did it better
  slightly
  the problem is the cut meta always has cuter cuts imo
  the cut on it is super cute i def wish the tulle was removable for more versatility tho
  i stalked and reserved the shit out of this beauty  cant wait this is chill enough that i can wear to work with poof and no one can give me any bs about being too dressed up
  nope meta did
  special mention to the amazing mam
  mam what the fuck
  the small thumbnail made it look like a shrimp that was the decoration
  its mimicking the signature on buzzs shoe which since he came after woody was when andy had learnt how to make a proper n
  this is by far the worst denim design
  thats fair mam gets honorable mention      lol i can see it        the stock pictures are tragic but it really does look decent worn does anyone have the picture of the japanese lolita wearing it
  eeurgh the designs dangling right in front of the crotch is so awkward
  while were on the topic of mam i like this release in brown okay in pink its hideous
    looks like pinkily ever after in pink
  i cant hate this its too cute imo
  i am pretty confident thats not how you spell better
  the biggest sin about british bear for me is the cheap poly satin they used i would probably love this dress if it was printed on a heavy weight cotton but the tacky material just absolutely ruins it for me
  big boob bow / better
  jsyk the big bodice bow is detachable and comes with both the denim and the terry fabric versions    i actually think it looks fantastic but to each their own
  well okay denimchan i guess youre the one for whom theyre making these
  im pretty psyched desu  i love nontraditional fabrics in lolita there used to be so much more experimentation i feel  bring back corduroy  tweed give us more velvet velveteen and velour
  oooh i actually do like how huge the bow is cute
    im gonna need the name of this dress anons i got into fairy kei just as pinkly ever after shut down and i loved their aesthetic
  i was not sold on this before but god this is so cute
  courdoroy   i fucking love this i have a gorgeous courdoroy skirt from ap i think and i dont understand why brands dont use it more often the texture is just so nice
  i love this one tho
time to reminisce      when did you discover lolita how old were you   what substyle first interested you   what was your first dream dress did you ever get it   first brand dress   did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita   how have your tastes changed
   when did you discover lolita how old were you  i want to say i was about 15 i was a baby weeb and somehow fell backwards into the vm website    what substyle first interested you  classic i adored looking at the old mm/vm releases   what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  despite knowing about lolita much earlier it took until after i graduated college and a bad breakup for me to get back into things i remember seeing pic related and falling in love after a lot of searching it was one of the first dresses i bought   first brand dress  mary magdalene eglantyne op in pink   did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  i loved more how elegant it seemed i also had the opportunity to see btb and getoffegl in its glory which was entertaining   how have your tastes changed  they havent i guess over time ive been more interested in mm than vm and have been more subdued about how i coord
    i first discovered lolita in 2008 when i was 14 years old the first substyle that caught my attention was classic ironically i saw merry sweet castle in a tokyopop translation of the glb never got it yet got my ultimate dream dress twinkle carnival years later first brand dress was an underbust corset jsk from iw honestly there was a lot of lolita media back then that influenced me but mainly seeing lapin angelique while playing the world ends with you my style hasnt changed much but id like to wear more of the gothic substyle at some point doubt ill ever stop loving this fashion lol
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  i dont remember exactly when but i think i was about 12 i used to play stardoll a lot its that site that had all the celebrity dress up games but you could also make your own virtual paper doll avatar and basically just build your dream wardrobe they had a jfashion inspired store in the mall i think it was called sunny bunny which became my favourite and i joined a group on the forums for kawaii clothes and someone brought up lolita honestly it was love at first sight when i googled it i never wore it until much later though even bodyline seemed expensive to me when i was a little babbu so my dress obtaining was limited to scarce gifts until high school when i had a job and was able to get more than one dress every two years  what substyle first interested you  definitely sweet and i became interested during that time where super pastel late 2000s sweet was cool and everyone was shitting their bloomers over sugary carnival and milky planet i dont like that style anymore i stick to classic and the kind of sweet that is less likely to get me accused of being an ageplayer  what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  my first dream dress was either sugary carnival or milky planet but i never got either and theyre no longer dream dresses   first brand dress  my first dress was also my first brand dress there used to be a store in my town that stocked japanese stuff and they had some innocent world my parents knew i liked that stuff and i was lucky enough to recieve a jsk   that i cant remember the name of for my 14th birthday i wore it to my first con the next day with a friend who was in a ghibli cosplay who later became a gothic lolita which makes me very happy  did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  i got big into manga by peach pit like rozen maiden and shugo chara    pic unrelated just a coord i like
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  back around 2010 i believe i was looking up cyber goth which somehow led to fairy kei which somehow led to lolita i was 16ish     what substyle first interested you  sweet by far     what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  chess chocolate my boyfriend got it as a bday gift a couple years ago it was everything i hoped it to be and more     first brand dress  btssb dreamy pony jsk i applied some roll on fragrance from a shop i used to work at and then ironed it big mistake left giant yellow stains all over i think i was 18 at the time so i was pretty fucking dumb when it came to clothes      did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  i cant think of any one particular coord or pic but this always pops into my mind because it was one of the first pictures i saw and thought it was adorable     how have your tastes changed  i grew out of oot sweet / full on sweet to more of a toned down/classical sweet at first i thought i wanted to be oot and in peoples faces but quickly realized my favorite coords were just easy  comfy matching sets i wasnt very creative when i wore lolita desu
   when did you discover lolita how old were you  i was a freshman in highschool when i first discovered lolita around 2012 aka the era of ott sweet    what substyle first interested you  sweet sweet sweeet  2012 was an era of ott sweet and it has clearly heavily influenced my wardrobe in future years since in highschool my broke ass couldnt afford it   what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  sugary carnival its basic bitch sweet but goddamn that dress made my weeb heart go doki doki back in the days ive recently acquired it after waiting for it to pop up at the right price i still love it to this day despite it being replicated so much   first brand dress  toy parade 2012 jsk in mint god im glad i decided to save my monies for burando before diving into lolita    did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  nakamura asumiko i read her oneshots without realizing all the girls were wearing some form of lolita to this day i want to own every dress with her art or inspired by her art    how have your tastes changed  i thought id always be a sweet girl but old school gothic has been calling me so much lately so im trying to lose weight to fit into my old school dream dresses god i love lolita so much
 when did you discover lolita how old were you   back in 2010 in high school i was probably 16 years old i discovered it through visual kei and general harajuku fashion   what substyle first interested you  sweet hime and gothic   what was your first dream dress did you ever get it   my first dream dress was metamorphose  dim light got it when it was rereleased   first brand dress  my first brand dress was baby the stars shine bright  junos bouquet   did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  this video    how have your tastes changed  i like classical more now and only some sweet and gothic love ott and hime
   when did you discover lolita how old were you  i was 14 i think i found it in 2004/2005 i found it online i think through street snaps and googled my way to the egl lj comm i was super active on lj at the time so it was easy to just infuse the community into my everyday life   what substyle first interested you  oh gosh everything this was back when shiro and kuro were still considered main substyles and sweet was just oldschool dresses in pink colorways so there wasnt as much variety as there is now i was drawn to nautical motifs the most though   what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  meta marine stripe i did get the skirt but at the time i was too fat for it so i took it apart and frankensteined it back together so badly that its unwearable i still have it though been thinking of taking it to a seamstress for years to have it repaired to fit me now since im much thinner   first brand dress  i didnt buy a brand dress until metas marine border series in 20082009 but i had a few brand skirts most of my pieces were handmade monsters up until about 2009 lol   did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  honestly i cant remember any particular images but i loved looking through the street snaps and i loved a lot of the efamous lolitas at the time my favorites were osea_chelleo faunkegin crazysporkiam theosakakoneko phenphenny octavekitten katzixx sp    how have your tastes changed  they havent much its more been that ive kept my love for the older things while liking most of the new things that happen in the fashion so i guess my taste is more diverse now because lolita is more diverse
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  i think i vaguely knew about lolita for a long time since i was interested both in alternative fashion and japanese culture i started actively learning about it when i was about 20 years old   what substyle first interested you  classic but i was interested in gothic as well    what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  i dont have much money i cant afford to have a dream dress i guess  if i had one it would probably be from mm or vm but finding a particular piece within an okay for me price range is not very likely especially since mm and vm arent common secondhand i usually dont look for a specific dress i prefer to buy something i like and that is within my budget    first brand dress  eglantyne op by mm    did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  not really i remember reading a manga othello whose protagonist secretely was a lolita i actually hated it though it was so bad ahah    how have your tastes changed  i still love the things i loved back when i started so classic and gothic but today i can also appreciate toned down or simple sweet i never thought id want to wear otome too but today i consider it more creative than lolita in some cases and more wearable for everyday life
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  middle school tokyopop or something      what substyle first interested you  sweet angelic pretty      what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  first dream dress was an anna house pink x white jsk by the time i could afford the fashion i never went around to buying it  moved on     first brand dress  btssb white x pink sailor dress still have it but havent worn in years     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  mostly japanese street snap shots gothic lolita bible fruits magazine / book      how have your tastes changed  i still covet sweet but am slowly branching out to classic and a bit of gothic its probably coming with age
  i was looking up cyber goth  i havent heard of that one for ages does it still exist    which somehow led to fairy kei which somehow led to lolita  now that is quite a journey
the first time i saw lolita and actually got into it are different     be 12 or 13  huge weeb phase loving anime and manga and shit  know about decora and love it my decora outfits from those days are laughable  in bookstore with mum she sees the first english edition of glb says i should get it because i love japanese stuff so much  i look at it but im actually not that interested still get it though  i didnt particularly like or dislike lolita from that time but my taste wasnt mature enough to enjoy it  didnt know who mana was at the time and thought those ads of him was a girl kek    fast forward now 2013 or 2014    enjoy doing cosplay with friends though we only do it about once a year and its a pretty casual hobby  an acquaintance that knows i go to 4chan says i should check out cgl because cosplay  go to cgl bc y not  see cosplay but whats this see all this 20082012 era ap shit  fall down the rabbit hole spend weeks researching lolita and loving it     been wearing it for 4 years now
anyone else bothered by calling it babylita
  no  who cares
  no
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  2005 or 2006 when i was 15/16   what substyle first interested you  gothic and darker classic like moitie and jetj   what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  my first dd was jetj dragon chan and i got the rerelease last year    first brand dress  i think my first direct brand purchases were an aatp lp and a solid iw jsk in 2009   did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  japanese street snaps on flickr and zemotion on deviantart also shitty mana cosplayers on myspace   how have your tastes changed  a lot aatp and moitie used to be my favourite brands and at some point also jetj i used to love screen print and those thick cotton fabric prints aatp used to have but now im more focused on actual fabric quality these days i stick to florals solids more toned down stuff oh and vm is my favourite brand
 when did you discover lolita how old were you 1314 back in 2004    what substyle first interested you gothic i was a little wannabe mallgoth and discovered gothic lolita through looking up gothy stuff online i didnt start wearing it until 2009 though mostly because i was terrible at money management as a teen and ended up getting into sweet instead of gothic at that time    what was your first dream dress did you ever get it milkychan and hell yeah i got it ive since sold it and kinda regret it even though its not really my style anymore its just so frickin cute    first brand dress metas princess crown bouquet in pink and black i actually traded it for milkychan back in the day and am seriously considering buying it again because desu the print is gorgeous and its more my style now than it was then    did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita that morbid outlook article lmao also i used to spend hours on avant gauche looking at glb scans miss that site    how have your tastes changed im not into ott sweet anymore i guess my tastes have matured i still wear sweet but more subdued and simple styles ive really been getting into oldschool pink and white sweet and ivory colorways which my younger self would have hated maybe sweetclassic would be a good description of my current style i still suck at gothic though i will never be the bad ass gothic lolita of my 14 year old selfs dreams oh well i like being cute too much i cant help it the closest to gothic i ever get is buying prints in the black colorway lol
   when did you discover lolita how old were you  it was fall 2013 and i was 18 looking for something to buy for the local renaissance festival i was cheap so i started looking on ebay and saw one of those victorian dress sellers i worried if they were actually selling what they had images of and tried to research found fanfriend somehow buying something hideous there and i remember finding egl after that winter when doing more research sadly i missed the heyday of the site    i did follow versailles hard during their debut years but i just never realized those kinds of clothes were actual things you could wear     what substyle first interested you  classic vm and mm especially while i really liked gothic too it took a while for me to get over my internalized antigoth stigma     what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  i dont remember how good my definition of dream dress was but i adored nameless poems first release and it was the first ever dress i bought on the second release since i wanted it so badly later trawled through lolibrary and made a list of dream items ended up in the next two years getting aatps le petit chaperon rouge jsk in green and iws rose panel jsk in black ive always loved puppet circus but i dont let myself think about that lol     first brand dress  iws vilma op in navy bought it in 2015 i had bought some small brand stuff but never owned a non taobao dress until that moment     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  i wish i could remember just lots of vm and mm dresses buttcapes 2015 wardrobe post heavily inspired me getting into gothic and still does     how have your tastes changed  realizing that instead of getting all of the taobao i just wanted to focus on cut/quality i now buy and wear mostly printless items i still admire mm but accepting that i probably wont fit the brand after years of looking at it is hard
  ayy same first dress im  as someone whos been collecting the main two lessons you need to learn are patience and diligence if you cant necessarily afford it now start saving up in a little lolita fund while you save start looking at the japanese sites frilyjapanmercari using the kanji for vm/mm by the time you save up enough something new will have probably popped up vm is also a lot more plentiful than mm so you have that going for you it isnt as instantgratificationlike as some sweet brands but its worth it  t slowly collecting all the mm i can find
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  i was 14 and was actually introduced by a friend who was super into japanese fashion she always talked about how she loved sweet lolita and fairy kei and i loved how lolita looked      what substyle first interested you  i really liked ott sweet but knew it wouldnt even go on my body more realistically i loved toned down classic     what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  my first dream dress was probably the nightmare before christmas collab with h naoto i owned itfor a day i absolutely hated it but i do currently own two other dream dresses and adore them     first brand dress  angelic prettys toy parade op in mint     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  tumblr was my first regularexposure to lolita this was when lilithgrey and hellobatty were both still active wearers and i still consider them my original inspiration for getting into the style     how have your tastes changed  my first batch of dresses were super sweet but that gave way to solid black pieces and now i wear a mix of black and lavender i definitely got into the more daily and toned down fashion i originally admired which i never really thought about until now i can only imagine how my taste will change in the coming years as i get older and more settled as an adult
   when did you discover lolita how old were you  13 or 14 i was into cosplay and found lolita through gothloli cosplays      what substyle first interested you  gothic and not like anime gothloli ironically enough like actual vk hail manasama gothic     what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  iron gate i dont own it since ironically enough i never even wore gothic     first brand dress  aatps tricolor toy jsk in black pic related it was also my first dress and a birthday present from my mother     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  there was a picture in phaidons gothic  lolita book of a girl in an old school tartan coord holding a poodle and that was one of my biggest inspirations at the time and also the reason why i have a major weakness for tartan     how have your tastes changed  even though i started out liking gothic lolita i never wore it and actually jumped in classic since then ive also dabbled in sweet but ive primarily stuck with classic
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  more than 8 years ago i was 13 at that time it took a year before i had convinced my parents and got the approval to order something online so i was 14 when i first wore lolita at least an attempt at lolita     what substyle first interested you  i cant remember i have always been extremely all over the place but those days i was mainly focussed on gothic lolita as that was the only style my mom would let me wear     what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  i cant remember if it was the aatp x versailles rose ribbon jsk or aatps libretto stripe op i do own the first dress but not the second one i do still want it because of nostalgia but i dont think i would wear it     first brand dress  baby the stars shine bright versailles rose bouquet rosary jsk it wasnt my favourite cut but i needed it for an event i still own it and hope to buy the charlotte cut sometime soon     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  kanon wakeshima her music videos versailles their collabs with aatp and of course manas glb shoot i was mainly influenced by the artists i listened to     how have your tastes changed  actually it hasnt changed that much the dresses i wanted to buy when i started out are still items i would buy and wear now the difference is that the dresses my mom wouldnt let me buy in those days are dresses i do buy now i am no longer dependent on my parents so i can finally achieve how i wanted to look when i first started    i am grateful of my strict parents though because they didnt let me buy items directly i never ended up ordering something from a website like milanoo i never rushed into the style and had a long time to think about what i wanted i still own and wear my first dress first coord sucked big time nevertheless
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  i was around 15 at the time i love malice mizer and mana one day i decided to do some research on mana found out about moi meme moitie and that fell into a rabbit hole from there     what substyle first interested you  gothic      what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  my dream dress was iron gate the obvious answer is no and never     first brand dress  aatp katrina dress     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  i havent been interested in lolita for almost 6 years one day i released i unhappy i was with my appearance i had completely given up on it since i thought everything looked ugly on me and no matter how hard i tried all my effort was for nothing with that in mind i was on pinterest looking for inspiration and ran back into lolita again this time is was a bunch of scans from gothic lolita bible i couldnt exactly remember what picture it was but the pic related must have been among them i fell in love with lolita again and decided to give it a go again     how have your tastes changed  when i first got into lolita i thought blackxwhite and old school  ita because i was dumb thats funny considering my first lolita blouse was a bodyline ita mess that was too big for me nowadays i love old school so much other than that i am still hardcore into gothic lolita and classic lolita like i was originally i probably would stay away from bodyline now unlike when i first started
   when did you discover lolita how old were you  i was about 19 actually and it was my freshman year of college gothic lolita bibles were being sold at my college towns walden bookstore in the mall we spent so much time in there browsing manga and fruits like the weebs we were   what substyle first interested you  country lolita then and country lolita now i also liked ouji secretly and tried to be one with little success   what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  see pic related yes i know its a hot mess but its a beautiful hot mess and i love it and i love other hot messes it looked really good with this silver blouse i used to own that i now regret giving up   first brand dress  metamorphose oldschool piece it doesnt really have a name and technically its a skirt tiered and marinestriped with dainty cotton daisy lace at the hem its stained and old but i wear it casually   did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  all of the street shots i just thought tokyo girls were so cool and i really admired that they had the bravery to go out and wear what they wanted i wasnt that brave at the time   how have your tastes changed  i no longer fool myself into believing that i can do ouji thanks boobs and i have discovered that i love simplicity and good quality above all else forever an oldschooler      omg the lace on those sleeves makes my heart hurt
   when did you discover lolita how old were you  i knew about lolita back in 2008 when i was 12    what substyle first interested you  funny enough i wanted to be a gothic lolita first then quickly shifted to wanting to be ott sweet   what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  as basic as it is sugary carnival was the one i wanted most i think and i never got it simply because once i could afford itit just wasnt my thing anymore but i did get other dresses that were on my previous dream dress list   first brand dress  a white karami jsk from baby   did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita     how have your tastes changed  im definitely more into simple lolita more toned down sweet my love for pastel stayed but i just wear it in a different way aka not ott at alla way that makes me feel me and comfortable i also fell back in love with old school and darker colors as well i used to bash myself on the head way too much about the rules/having only one style/ but now i just stopped and figured out what truly made me happy about lolita    pic relatedthe very first lolita picture i ever saw
  forgot to answer that lots of street snaps/popular livejournal lolitas/ and off courseanimeeven though the portrayal was inaccuratemade me really fall in love with lolita along with that one japanese documentary thats a decade old and two videos that disappeared one with misakoone with a daily lolita
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  i honestly cant remember exactly how i first discovered lolita its a toss up between livejournal or tumblr i know i was around 1314 though and loved it on sight on other people i didnt make the decision to actually even imagine myself wearing the fashion till i was 1617 i finally outgrew caring about what other people think of me grew some self confidence and made a super cringy bodyline order      what substyle first interested you  sweet ive always been a sucker for pink      what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  my first dream dress was milky berry in mint and it was one of the first brand pieces i owned     first brand dress  metas princess wardrobe in grey     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  i quite quickly had a whole list of dream dresses and looks when i stumbled back into lolita and when i finally got out of my ita phase and decided to take lolita seriously it was super inspiring to browse other peoples looks and coords with my dream dresses saving coords with my fave dresses in a map on my laptop telling myself it was outfit inspo for when i totally get that dress was really fun      how have your tastes changed  i still love sweet lolita the most but i find my wardrobe has deviated quite a bit since the beginning i now have some dresses that i love to throw on for a casual coord just hanging out with friends before i had a mindset that lolita was my ott princess moment and i always wanted to go all out with a sweet coord now id say my wardrobe is half sweethalf classic with some nice browns in there among the pink/mint/pastels and i love having that option of going for an outfit i know will stand out a lot sweet or one thatll just make me feel elegant and ladylike in a casual classic coord
  i havent heard of that one for ages does it still exist  probably i dont see something underground like that ever truly going away    now that is quite a journey  it was i think i was looking up dreadfalls and was looking at pastel crap which led to the fairy kei / decora sales site on lj they linked the lolita sales lj in their sidebar iirc it was an odd trip
  ayy same first dress  yeah i noticed after posting my comment and was surprised although my version is blue for some reason stock pictures are hard to find    if you cant necessarily afford it now start saving up in a little lolita fund  i probably didnt express myself very well i do have the money to buy a 200usd dress but i could never spend that much on a dress for the way i was raised/the way i am i dont own any   valuable thing so even wearing a 100usd dress out makes me quite worried about spoiling it i also cant justify spending a lot on lolita dresses because unfortunately i cant wear them often but i love the idea of the fund i had never thought about it ill definitely give it a try    start looking at the japanese sites frilyjapanmercari  ive recently started doing this and i did notice that things can be pretty inexpensive there i used to buy from secondhand japanese stores because i trusted them more but i might give private sellers a try     thank you and i wish you luck with your mm collection
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  i was about 14 i had a rp blog of all things saw mary magdalene stock pics of jsks on tumblr and people would be like my character would wear this xd and i liked the dresses so i had a look and the more i looked the more i realised their characters wouldnt wear the clothes because they thought they were poofy sundresses when in actuality they were lolita of course i couldnt get pieces until way later but i guess i was into classic first     what substyle first interested you  gothic and mm classic i didnt like iw or ott sweet i ended up having a sweetloving phase i prided myself on liking more mature sweet pieces like loyal rosette romantic rose letter and cinema doll oh to be young and naive     what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  my first dream dresses were loyal rosette op in green and cinema doll loyal rosette probably wouldnt suit me nowadays but im getting cinema doll in the mto super excited     first brand dress  trianon op by baby in lavender its beautiful but i barely wear it shame because its comfy af and fully shirred in a billion places     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  ive never been able to stick to one style of lolita so picking one single pic was so damn difficult i was about 16ish when deerstalker were in their heyday and the sheer fun they seemed to be having really got me     how have your tastes changed  i wear whatever substyle now trying to get back into sweet because that 2012  2015 era sweet really hits me in the heart aside from pastel vomit  ive never liked pastel vomit on me
    i would never refer to myself as a baby so i see it as odd and childish honestly
  sounds like you have a weird relationship with the concept of childish things and babies maybe if you stopped finding them sexual or insane youd be a more well adjusted person get over it
i remember being a poor teenager and fawning over new releases like mrc and romantic rose letter i wish i had money back then so i could have purchased the whole set immediately instead of hunting down different pieces secondhand
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  i discovered lolita around 2006 when i was in 7th grade i found the kamikaze girls book in a bookstore and then lurked the egl livejournal comm for years but i didnt buy my first dress until 2012   what substyle first interested you  gothic/classic im still pretty much into the same brands vm mm jetj and millefleurs   what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  there was a jetj dress i was dying to graduate in when i was in middle school pic related and while i own quite a lot of jetj from that time period now i dont have this one and am kinda doubtful if i ever will given the inflation on old jetj nowadays   first brand dress  it was actually jetjs letoile du soir jsk which was pretty lucky i got into lolita at the height of ott sweet lolita so lots of classic and gothic dresses were justaround not being bought   did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  i fell in love with that one blackxwhite baby ad where the model is wearing a bonnet and hiding behind a tree also the street snap with two girls and one is wearing this vm bustier from 2001 and a pretty short skirt and she has a hime cut and braids    how have your tastes changed  i mean i think im better at putting together outfits now and as the fashion evolves ive loved many of the new trends that have come from it sack dresses the influence of western indie brands elaborate headdresses the religion trend but at the end of the day i pretty much like the same shit
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  14 years old 2005 kamikaze girls advert     what substyle first interested you  even though i initially saw sweet lolita and btssb it was the classic lolita because of this coord and mary magdalene that drew me in shame it was a costume for the movie instead of an actual dress for sale     what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  this was so long ago but i want to say it was mms copine georgette jsk no i never did its incredibly difficult to find even back then ive had opportunities to try on mm pieces thanks to a mentor but even my teen body found their clothes too small /    at the time though i did pine for an anna house skirt and did get it with the headbow i didnt have a complete coord but i felt like i understood the fashion better and closer to an actual lolita      first brand dress  aps glitter trump jsk sadly ive sold the set because it eventually got tight and i was giving up sweet my first brand item however is babys snow dot skirt i still have it and though it doesnt go with my current style im keeping it because i got it on my first visit to a brand shop      did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita    pic related     how have your tastes changed  i went from sweet to gothic specifically kuro lolita to classic now i mainly wear classic collect old school pieces ive always wanted as a teen and easing into otome       screamsgif    i totally had a lolita character in a rp board when i was a teenager
  i never said it was sexual though  i just dont want to lower myself to the status of baby like you can be new to something sure but calling it baby adds this childish vibe to it someone i work with called the new hires babies and i cringed had nothing to do with sex i know where youre getting that from but that isnt what i said at all
  me too 11 years later the jsk is in my wardrobe       avant gauche  w e w   hit me in the feels        oh shoot i forgot i had a long country lolita and sailor lolita phase before committing to classic i tried and failed punk lolita     if i had settled on a style and not gotten so chub lately id probably amass a huge wardrobe sometimes i feel less of a lolita for having a comparably small wardrobe but everyones journey is different im just thankful that i never left the fashion and got to see it evolve since egls zenith     /sage
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  i discovered it in highschool when my nice weeb friend told me i reminded her of kanon wakeshima i was 14 then     what substyle first interested you  2010 ap sweet     what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  i think it was the ap tokimeki girl op i got it sometime last year     first brand dress  ap dreamy baby room jsk i was a wee 14 year old visiting ap sf for the first time and didnt know it was kind of polarizing no regerts its still cute     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  sifting through the glbs had a part in making me want to actually wear it     how have your tastes changed  i focused a lot on buying my favorite ap prints but now that my wardrobe is full of them i just buy solids/simple patterns dabbling in classic lolita in general doesnt make me as excited as it used to i think i bought too much in too short of a time and the glimmer wore off
  i pronounce it babbylita tbf
   when did you discover lolita how old were you  middle school at about 13 i was constantly surrounded myself with weeb and weebinspired stuff so it was only a matter of time i was shocked to discover that not only was there a way to dress like muh animu irl without it being a costume or based on any specific character but that there was an entire subculture dedicated to it as a fashion i was hooked     what substyle first interested you  i was an edgy emo so i wanted all black not realizing that kuro / gothic after doing more research i leaned more towards classic i was also a little into historical fashion so it then became a thing of muh edwardian summer      what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  first legit brand dress i became fixated on was iws marie rose op had the chance to get it a while ago but i realized it just doesnt do it for my anymore     first brand dress  heh im nervous that this might be incriminating but iws berangere rose bought it straight from the online store summer sale and boy was that a rush     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  all of the pics from lolitafashionorg mainly the kuro ones like pic related i tried to revisit the site in the past but alas both it and hellolace are gone i wish there was a way i could determine which photos were on the site so i can track them down for myself     how have your tastes changed  i wear all three substyles interchangeably now despite the fact that in middle school i was very indifferent towards sweet and bright colors in general i was also very humbled by just looking at the fashion and the thought wearing it or even coming close to owning it was a distant dream
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  it was like 2015 i was like 16 and searching venus angelic or something like that and i went on the angelic pretty website and saw all the lovely pastel poofy dresses and absolutely loved it    what substyle first interested you  definitely sweet   what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  crystal dream carnival in navy i actually didnt have a dream dress until this year when i saw it for the first time   first brand dress  mary romance from ap its like a lucky bag dress that i overpaid for on lm but i love it so much   did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  the post cards on the ap website really did it for me   how have your tastes changed  ive kind of fallen out of sweet i like solids and im leaning more towards classic
   when did you discover lolita how old were you  read kamikaze girls when i was 12 because my best friends big sis said momoko reminded her of me she kind of forced me to read it it was a bit weird thinking back on it i was an ugly nerd with no fashion sense how did she ever guess id like lolita   i didnt even google and get into the fashion until i was 14 or so and didnt own brand until i was 16      what substyle first interested you  classic but ive always been sort of in between them all      what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  ribbon rose embroidery and iron gate yes i have both      first brand dress  btssb name of the rose halter jsk      did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  kamikaze girls nana kitade an old ad for mary magdalenes rote rose manas pics pics on lj of comm meetups also beths weird ads with the bunny heads they freaked me out but i loved the coords      how have your tastes changed  im more into gothic now but my taste hasnt changed much since i was young i just know how to better execute a coord now
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  its been so long i hardly remember was probably 11 or 12 i came across it online looking for cosplays and then later a friend reintroduced me to it and i started to gain further interest once i got a style name and everything     what substyle first interested you  gothic i love all the really elegant gothic coords     what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  it was some super frilly black dress from fanplusfriend ugh i never got it ended up making my first lolita dress ever     first brand dress  i actually only recently got my first brand dress  crystal dream carnival in lavender ive been considering selling it though     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  all the old street snaps of lolitas mainly in the winter with their big fluffy coats and parasols     how have your tastes changed  im super into pink and frills super over the top sweet coords i do still love very elegant styles though just not sure theyd suit me
  oh wow anon were really similar i got into lolita at the same age through dress up games    first substyle  i was into classic at first ogling mary magdalene but it was too expensive and i was so young that the single classic bodyline dress i bought didnt really suit me   once i got to high school and got a job at 14 i started buying old school baby and ap because it was the only burando i could afford in the quantities i wanted i wear otome and sweet/classic now  first dream dress  i wanted mary magdalenes claudette op in light blue its still on my wishlist and i actually have money now so hopefully ill be able to afford it soon  first brand dress  babys red hood op in ivory i sold it to another gull who wanted it since i only ever wore it twice it was just too much of a lewk for me to feel comfortable with  media  i was obsessed with lolita blogs when i was younger especially fyeahlolita im still sad that carochan isnt active anymore
  great thread op     when did you discover lolita how old were you  i was 17 i was looking at general weeb shit which led me to visual kei which then led me to lolita    what substyle first interested you  ott sweet   what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  sugary carnival op in sax i first bought the replica in sax when i was 20 and never wore it i did eventually buy the actual jsks in pink and sax but sold them immediately because it didnt look right on me id still consider buying the op for nostalgia   first brand dress  fancy box in navy   did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  i fell in love with all of cadneys ott sweet coords it made me want to buy and wear lolita so badly   how have your tastes changed  i switched from ott sweet to classic old school and toned down sweet i kept my fancy box jsk set because it still makes my heart go doki doki whenever i wear it
 when did you discover lolita how old were you  i was 16 or 17 and i was obsessed with tomoyo from cardcaptor sakura one day when i went to my towns comic book shop to buy another volume of ccs i saw a gothic  lolita bible and that was it the old me was slain     what substyle first interested you  gothic particularly gothic in white     what was your first dream dress did you ever get it  aatps stained glass jsk in ivory and metas revival bouquet bustle op in green i got the second one for my birthday two years ago        first brand dress  aatps victoria jsk in ivory     did any particular coords pics media etc make you fall in love with lolita  nana kitade mana and kayas glb photos as well as the few lolitas in the fruits books     how have your tastes changed  i still love gothic and classic oldschool styles and solids but i have the ability to coord costumier pieces into a normal outfit now without looking like my clothes are wearing me

previous thread     old thread is on autosage how was everyones con lets hear about the good the bad and the ugly
  sorry for fucking up the title slight newfag here
i only spent sunday there with my brother i havent been to this con since 2011 with some guys i met online just sucks i couldnt experience the other 2 days or the meet ups you all had  did they still have the rooms that showed nothing but anime
met some cool people and actually remembered to get social media info talked about /a/ gembutts and memes with cosplayers at the houseki shoot bought pretty keychains of characters i love that i usually dont see merch for got to eat five guys astoria bakery and mac n cheese generally had a great time dipshitting around with friends i havent seen in a while     this is my own fault but i felt dumb for buying a whole weekend badge the only fun i got out of it was the dealers hall and the tabletop room the panels my group picked to go to were duds the maid cafe started over an hour late and was running out of food we didnt stay at the rave for too long im learning from my mistake and just buying a day badge next year     also security at the rencen were aggressive as shit i understand that the weebs were worse than ever this year but still felt bad
overall 6/10 for me the organization of this con is just terrible and getting around is just such a hassle mainly just people watched and didnt really utilize my badge that much the gull meetup was pretty fun though
i spent the entire time with friends or crushing idiots in the game room because im not a nerd
the brochures they gave out were so awful we just ended up walking around and seeing what there was instead of going anywhere specific literally a brochure for ants
there were no goblin children for me to beat with a club con was pretty fun despite a lot of walking and all my cosplays held up great
the con is too big imo having to travel between two different buildings was ridiculous ive never seen anything like it and it wasnt quick to get between them either     i feel like most all of the good events were happening in cobo so i dont understand why they wouldnt just have the whole con there
this con was a mess wrong information everywhere stuff cancelled or starting late broken escalators and the program booklet was so hard to read and full of errors that they would have been better off saving the money and not printing one at all
  probably because of the number of attendees but the rencen wants youmacon the fuck out of there anyway theyre doing expensive renovations and trying to reinvent themselves as a really highclass place and having a weekend where drunk weebs come in and throw mugs and pipes off of the balcony kind of ruins that so it might be a good move for youma to cut ties with the rencen and just use the cobo they could use some of the crownes space like they did for the maid cafe i dont know where theyd have the concerts and raves though
this was my 4th year and i finally cosplayed it was great even tho 2 girls thought i was a character from the walking dead the best part was i managed to make this year drama free i didnt meet up from anyone here i didnt know that was a thing but im really looking forward to go to ohayocon in january if you guys meet there id be down to go to the meet up so you guys can roast me on my cosplay
saw the black marika in the gaming room recognized him from tinder a long time ago talked got his fb    first post on fb contained the word cuck  told him i had a partner in advance and he still flirted  sent me drunk selfies and i felt uncomfy as fuck because next thing you know therell be a dick  blocked immediately    can con niggas act normal
did lottie snotgirl cosplay bunny maid and then a demon    got asked thrice once by a cop twice by civilians if i was okay and safe    i wasnt even dressed that thotty
  yo i saw you as snotgirl and took your picture
i didnt take too many pictures because i dont really like to bother people with that but this guy and the midoriya was my favorite
  the houseki shoot was chill as fuck i have to stop cosplaying flavor of the month stuff small shoots are based   was black and white legs phos
what was the worst thing you saw all con anons mine was a girl in booty shorts with period blood all over her ass cheeks i felt bad for her but i didnt say anything
  they were on the schedule from what i saw
    this old school otaku panel where this guy played a 10 minute long video of himself doing the soiboy face
  a bowsette cosplayer in the merch room on saturday seemed dangerously close to having an unfortunate malfunction
  these two thots next to the badge line in almost nothing handing out was either their numbers or the room they were staying at to anyone in a lewd get up
  bless i saw another and she was really standoffish and rude like you dont have to act like the character
i had a great con the worst part was waiting in line to register on friday morning they didnt post the schedule on the website of course so i showed up at 8 am and ended up having to wait in line for four hours next to a girl that literally screamed every time she saw a cosplay she recognized but aside from that great con
just saw a post in the youmacon everyone security group about someone suspecting they were jabbed with a needle during the con what the fuck
  it really was its inspiring me to stop cosplaying popular fandoms and spend more time cosplaying things that i genuinely enjoy    i loved your cosplay i wish id gotten over my shyness and said hi  complimented you  was one of the antarc cosplayers
      i wanted to be friends with everyone at the houseki shoot but also didnt know how to approach everyone   wait a sec i talked about /a/ too at the shoot i was the other lapis who wasnt the host
anyone have pictures to share
  i remember you you were really cool i wish i could have had more of a conversation but im animeonly and just started the manga although talking to people at the shoot is inspiring me to get caught up asap
game room
  yes read the manga its worth it and you can finish it within a couple days at max   ill have to upload my houseki shoot photos somewhere too i just have to move them from my camera to the computer
  host lapis is a bitch irl even if they are good  cosplay
  holy shit if thats true i really hope theyre not a gull bitches start fights when people call them bitches
    i didnt know there were two lotties is this picture you
apparently theres an awoo girl who was part of a /cgl/ meetup
  thats not me pologies for the selfpost but i was thotty lottie from issue 4
    there were like 34 one in a cupcake dress the one in the cardigan me and one in a pink velvet dress in white vans
  it could have been an awoo girl i know of at least two potential candidates if thats the case
  there was and the cosplay was really good i should have taken a pic if i had known it was going to be more of a /pol/ meet up i wouldve left my sjw gf behind but it was still fun
  saw some really overweight dude wearing a revealing female cosplay with these red veiny stretch marks all over his stomach
  i might have seen the same thing was it a kill la kill cosplay and the dude was hella hairy and smelly
saw the cutest red panda fursuit and i absolutely wanted to hug them one of my favorite fursuits hands down
  girls who look like this make my depressed ass want to be successful
panelist here my panel was well attended despite the time slot but im definitely not doing it with my friend again they just had to turn everything into a pissing contest how theyre the biggest fan around and went out of their way to demean me down every time i tried to talk why even ask me to do a panel with you if youre gonna treat me like that
  yikes senpai sorry to hear that happened i didnt really go for the panels its my first con and im a shy little thing but undermining someone youre fond of to get cool points is so rude
  a photo has been surfacing on /ptg/
  im not really sure i couldnt really take my eyes off of his disgusting stretch marks i dont mind fat people cosplaying but for christ sakes cover that shit up
i saw a girl in a bunny unitard literally the sides of her vagina were out i gagged
also what was with the game room lacking in classic arcade machines my heart was broken when i didnt find the miss pacman machine
  i dont think they work with that vendor anymore half the stuff was broken all weekend when they did anyway but you can comment to them that you want classic arcades they read the feedback thread in the youmacon facebook group afaik they try to bring what people ask for
    awoo girl as in momiji from 2hu if so the chance of her being a dude is high
i took a few photos this year would anyone like a small photo dump
  do it anon
  can confirm not a dude
ok i finally uploaded them these are my photos from the houseki no kuni photoshoot  
thinking about doing a late night panel next year serve a bunch of coffee and chill while showing internet historian/metokur videos make it 18
  you know thats not going to go well with metokur dropping hard rs every other video
  i was thinking id start with internet historian and get a feel for the crowd if anyone is there to begin with and wait for the youmacon panel checker/inspector to leave before showing metokur stuff
    thats a lazy af panel please do better not that youmacon actually vets anything the room checkers usually stay the whole time though just fyi
  its supposed to be laid back but im just spitballing here ive seen the room checkers leave after tentwenty minutes we could cover more 4chan related topics in the panel too
i hope my photos dont rotate
maybe im getting too old or i dont watch enough anime but i didnt recognize half the characters people were cosplaying
that should be the last one
  i cant imagine a 4chan panel being anything but a sweaty cringfest but honestly that fits into youmacon pretty well
  would you prefer another interdimensional feminist cross review of steven universe
  yeah itd probably be better than a 4chan panel and appeal to a lot more people
  thanks for the photos anon
  kraft punk won my heart and my stomach bless them o
  moon cairn is a whole beauty and i appreciate their dedication to the cosplay while it was freezy as fuck outside
  what a waste of quads steven universe interdimenssional feminist cross review it is then
its really rude to try to pressure someone dressed in normal clothes to pose for a picture cut it out     it happened to me like several times i dress in normal clothes to avoid that kind of shit jesus
  they are 100 cranking their hog to that picture if you werent in a cosplay
  i suspected that for a few i said no to all of them
awoo
    the fat /pol/tard at the gull meet up who was loud as fuck and thought he was funny and cool for screaming /pol/ memes and claiming to be unironic about what he said
    game room was complete fucking trash this year im almost surprised youmacon is still even able to function since they seem to do everything they can to piss everyone off i know the head of media of youmacon literally went awal thursday night and no one has heard from her since
  how was it fucking trash
  the game room was pretty much the best its ever been what are you on media has nothing to do with running the game room
    no classic arcade games or cabinets  all the console games only had fortnight on it  small section for fighting games  majority of hall was down half the time        reread what i typed i wasnt implying that media ran he game room
  i actually have to agree the lack of cabinets from what i saw really made the arcade a place i didnt want to be specifically because i couldnt be there after 2 am its usually what i would do from 2 to 4 or 5ish it was fun but tabletop took that title for a night or two this year
  you must have not have actually been to the game room because vast majority of the room was fighting games or the stage
  there were signs showing which games you could play on them they werent permanently stuck on fortnite
youmacon this year seemed more positive and for the most part everyone seemed to enjoy the convention more unlike last year  maybe it was because the sun came out on saturday but it seems like there wasnt the same negative vibe over the whole event like last year
  im starting to appreciate the tabletop room a lot more than i used to this year i played some demos and bought two games the game library they had was pretty extensive too i hope youma keeps it 24 hours for next year
  mad lmao
  the game room head has a thing for tokyo attack so the con went from diverse with a ton of other vendors and arcade selection to just like every other con who gets ta only they lost their identity
  this explains a lot thanks for sharing anyone find it worth to get a badge for next year legit curious if people had a more positive time to get them going next year im on the fence and i really only wanna head back if they keep it up with the japanese guests desu
  i planned on hosting panels next year so i planned on going made some good friends despite being super anti social too
the only thing i wish for next year is working escalators or at least a solid stairway to the upper levels and for the schedule to be printed in a way that doesnt require a magnifying glass
  working escalators  wont happen they arent made to have the load of a convention of this size they were probably working the thursday of the con but then broke conspiracy theory reason the building staff blocked it off on purpose    schedule to be printed in a way that doesnt require a magnifying glass  the staff drag their feet so fucking hard that the schedule is a shitshow bigger cons can have schedules out online literally months in advance in comparison    want to change any of this too bad con staff is walled off to close friends and not actual trained professionals
  how does a con get this size and not act like a business
can someone tell me the character names thank you
did i just travel back in time
  first one is roman torchwick from rwby second one is a generic object head afaik

anybody have any news on when liz lisa is going to be announcing/releasing their lps this year     im torn between getting a liz lisa one or the sixitem axes femme one from here 
  if its like last year ll will reveal theirs at the end of november
  im always torn between these two but im always too poor to get the suitcase and always ends up going for the axes one because you get more clothing and its cheaper lol i was happy with last years too
  thanks      i got the poetique one from axes femme last year and i liked it at the time but ive sold all but two items and the bag since then
  okay i love the engrish on the sweater here
  the pink one is already sold out but only the pink  i copped the poetique one myself
majestic legon  
merry jenny  
  wtf i feel like they start earlier every year are most of these even real lucky bags leftover sale items
  oh no i need a lot of these    the cockatoo and kitties fruit seagulls and star fish ones are so adorable thanks for the link anon
  they still are but with an lucky pack exclusive item in most cases so they sell better as you can get most of the leftovers cheaper secondhand
  so people mainly buy them for the exclusive item now
will these brands do lucky bags again after the winter sale/in january
mars lucky bag  
emoda       most brands do a big round in january for new years and then some do a summer one in july/august if theres a brand you dont want to miss out on thats not a mainstream/small shop aka will have excess stock then you should preorder them now
conomi   
resexxy   
spiral girl  
e hyphen world gallery  
when does baby announce theirs if i remember they have actual lucky packs leftover stock and the special sets but are they announced on the same date
  and more  china   oversize   classic lolita   sweet lolita 
boz  
pattern  
candy stripper  
wego  
  yuck could they have got a better model than some unwashed greasy pig
  its their nowadays aethetic
  this is sold out too since i waited too long so i went for the online only one hoping its good
ive never bought a lucky pack because i like knowing what i pay for but im honestly considering getting a meta one this year just on the off chance they do one of those lucky pack skirts with the grimoire fabric
  i just ordered the plus size one on a whim i post pictures if anyones interested when i receive it i think it said late december
does anyone have pictures of last years rosemarie seor and honey cinnamon ones especially accessories
quick silly question does anyone know if lazy oaf jp is going to have lucky packs this year  i know they had them lasy year and i wasnt able to grab one so i was hoping they would pop up again this year
  2018  still supporting lazy oaf  aint nobody will help you with that considering all the replicas they did the latest ones being galaxxxy knockoffs
flint otome brand collective store coming this friday  
inkderic  
has anyone heard anything about nile perchs lucky packs this year are there any anons who have bought them in the past what did you think  worth it
  you can just use a forwarding service
rivet  surge  
  considering that nile perch switched the focus to madetoorder items a while ago i dont think there will be any considering their whole irl store is on clearance and dying
amavel

  this is super cute i want a bear related lucky pack 
  compare recent releases but the owner has a long history of copying japanese brands
  some older example  
  noooosorry for sort of offtopic but how much are things in their irl shop compared to online
  most goods are 1030 off in the laforet store
  im trying to choose between the fint bag and the an another angelus bag does anybody have experience with either of these lps in the past
  oh man that stuff is p cute toopoor though
do any of these brands use natural fabrics primarily rather than synthetics
  thanks anon i had no idea they were doing so poorly but i guess i havent been keeping up closely i hate to hear thati really hope they dont close
does milk offer a luckybag     i might buy a luckybag or two but ill probably end up hunting for seconds come january please post here with things you dont want so i can buy them
  yes instore some shops that sell milk like luke and stella and baby pink moon also do lucky packs
    theyre literally just holding a sale for this weekend its a 3 day sale  theyre not closing down
i hope swankiss japan makes another lucky pack this year i do enjoy their clothes/coats     although i really wasnt a fan of the one sold on otaku  if they do end up making another one i hope its better stuff this time
anmille  
  ahh im trying to decide myself i might go for angelus but not sure yet
has anyone ever purchased a liz lisa lucky bag while in japan like actually buying it in store im curious what the process is like since ive never bought one before
  its just as buying any other item from liz lisa in the harajuku shop theyre sold on the 1st in shibuya 109 2nd you just go and buy it when the shop opens at 8 am although they dont sold out as fast as previous years so i dont think its worth going at 5 am to buy them
gelato pique fuzzy roomwear  
lodispotto  
  the otakumode luckypack was so terrible im going to stick to buying the angel bag because atleast then i know the contents
im a total noob at this but ive been watching youtubers grab lucky bags for a few years and i was wondering how you go about getting your hands on these   if im to be more specific im interested in a pokemon centre bag because the value is amazing and im super picky when it comes to clothing
    huh cool i think ill be in tokyo then do you know what date the yokohama store releases their lps
listen flavor  
is it normal for lizlisa to not post lucky bag information by now i feel like if its suppose to be coming out on the 1st/2nd of dec they wouldve posted some information by now
ap has announced theirs
  i hope something is 100 cotton im not expert about ap but last time i checked the paris website they basically only sold 100 polyester dresses i was a little disappointed
  that ivory one and that green one are these coming to paris too
  oh and each one comes in different colours 1st one comes in ivory pink and black 2nd in pink sax red and black sweet bear comes in wine navy and brown lovely tartan comes in red and green and toy dreams comes in white pink and sax      id assume yes unless one sells out they dont seem to get stock at the same time      ive recently purchased a 100 cotton dress from ap paris but seeing as these are lps i wouldnt keep your hopes up
  if i want one of these should i do a japanese ss or wait for ap usa to get it and chance it cost wise
  i have if you check last years fukubukuro thread in the archives i dumped a bunch of photos from the 2017 fint lucky bag that i grabbed from twitter this was what i got in mine i personally really loved everything i received       oh my god that tartan one is calling my name
  japanese ss dont risk it
  out now instore only  
  thanks anon the items you got are all really cute the fint bag is sold out but im thinking i might bite the bullet and get the an another angelus bag
  is there a preview for this im on the fence for this one and usually they have previews
  agreeing with   my friend and i both got the same packs last year i used ss and she waited we both got it and paid roughly the same price just to answer your cost question
    i really want toy dream and all of its colorways are perfect but on top of me hating allover prints im also super scared of it being polyester it really looks like a cotton print though honestly   what do other anons think
  im new to aps lucky packs and kinda stupid do you get to pick the color you want or is it random
  i think it depends on your situation    the added cost of buying from japan is customs high or low depending on country  shipping fee high  ss fee low    the added cost of buying from your own country usa or europe for the paris shop is taxes high  shipping fee low  some uncertainty until they actually release the lucky packs    i live in europe and i will probably wait for them to get to the paris one because i wouldnt risk marking down a 200eur package if it gets lost is shit also if i dont want to get it lost id have to pay a lot for express shipping but then customs would definitely hit
  youve always been able to pick colour ever since theyve done these kinds of lps      they said usa so im assuming they live there they never get customs as far as i know
          my guess id say sweet bear the tartan set and the cafeteria set run a good chance of being cotton its weird but both ap and btssb at least seem to think cotton is older and therefore somewhat more cheap lp kind of material rather than polyester    elegant nightie looks like it might be a polyester set though  doesnt make sense to make a cotton dress that needs ironing with a tulle overlay that will melt at being ironed    toy dream honestly could go either way last years lp special print set was still cotton with a cotton blouse but ap is kinda known for trendhopping and changing things up so this could be the year their cheap lp print goes polyester instead of being traditionally cotton
aatp has announced theirs the bag contains accessories
  is that an obnoxious dollhouse purse in the kittens sweet whatever    i dont like anything else in that lp but so help me god
  fuckk why not the rose jail op
  because that dress is beautiful and deserves to be paid full price for
  aps border prints are always cotton allover is usually polyester
  why not just buy it yourself from japan
  fair enough
    i dont think you can chose the purse the only thing actually specified is the kittens sweet cherries cafe dinner jumperskirt and if im reading this right i think it says you cant chose the colour either the other items seem to be random as well
    where are you getting this data from traditionally their special new years print was always a border print and cotton what was their previous allover polyester special new years print
  thank you very helpful
  im going off ap releases in general i didnt mean that their lucky pack prints are polyester i was just saying their allover prints in general are though it looks like most of this years border print releases have been polyester too and cotton hasnt been the majority since 2016 sorry that was my mistake
post all jfashion discord servers here     1 please add the name of the server so that we dont end up linking communities twice   2 permanent invites are preferred but not mandatory   3 add info about the servers how much active salty etc at your discretion
im in the fa/cgl discord but i cant send invites would be cool to have an official cgl server though with categories for everyone like lolita jfash cosplay sewing etc
  i used to be in it but then got insulted twice on threads when they could recognize my writing style when all i did was casually speak and casually post both on the server and 4chan
  copied  pasted this from the recent thread that died     hopefully the link still works
official cgl discords never work  4chan discords always end up being one person or a group of people making a circlejerk and grabbing power before chasing normal people out    theres a few discords floating around but all of them have their own circlejerk generally they attract /pol/tards /r9k/ losers or sissies and then the sane people leave and go onto something else
  nice try moldemort youre banned for a reason
  not whoever this is if i was banned i wouldve understood but i really didnt do anything out of the ordinary  guess it was maybe one person that just didnt like me
  nanchatte seifuku friends small but decently active       jfashion community unfortunately dead if someone has another alternative or jfashion server pls post

  dont feel like giving my usernamebut i was pretty much a nobody
  i didnt post that but go off i guess lol also tell vqu i love her
  you could have easily ignored their comment but you didnt
                    this list was posted in the stupid questions thread but a lot of the links are dead
  the link of the jfashion one you posted is dead is it the same as 
not really cgl related but in case anyone is interested this kpop server index also has a short list of jpop/jdrama servers 
    what is this for yasis sorority

    thanks anons
  it isnt try this     i liked this server it was small and had many harajuku styles but it is definitely dead maybe we can revive it or something
  can you please repost this thank you    lolita fashion discord  
  why
  i want her to make the automatic brand update channels but my social anxiety is too strong to say anything on discord
  link is expired
  no it isnt
  then i dont have enough permits to join im confused i have a regular disord account and ive never even joined that discord
  okay it was chrome acting strange pasting the link directly onto discord works sorry for the mess
    lolita vetting server must provide proof pics active good for concrit and sales fixed link
fa x cgl discord has a big hive mentality culture where you get bullied for not thinking like the cool kids in there do theres also minimum lolita discussion and if you enjoy being orbited its the place for you i saw mentioned that the admin is a bit of a creep too but that was a year ago  the lolita fashion place without the vetting is best but sometimes bitchy
  uh yeah if you want to hang around a bunch of itas or 14 year olds who think their screenprinted circle skirt and office blouse is loli vetting is absolutely the way to go yeah youre not going to get asspats but youre also not going to be hanging out with idiots who try to purchase their entire wardrobe from amazon and call it old school you can actually hold conversations with people who know what theyre talking about and have the coords to prove it
  if you accepted me into your quote on quote secret princess discord then maybe just maybe i wouldnt be complaining about gatekeeping uh
is there a lolita server that is neither bitchy nor filled with cringey people i guess no huh
  the vetted server allegedly is but i wouldnt know would i
  if its the one with channels for drama i found it bitchy as well tbh
  the server is full of crossposters the egl channel is dead why is it even on here
  at least the lolitas wear the fashion unlike the lolitas in the non vetting servers
i wanna make my own lolita discord for people actually wearing the fashion with a more strict vetting process the vetting server lets anyone as long as they own at least like 3 dresses in  id like a more intense vetting maybe proof that you own at least 10 dresses and several blouses and accessories and have been interested in the fashion for 2 years  i can dream i guess id feel like a faggot just posting a server with only me and like 3 other people in it unless some people would be interested in giving it a go  im mostly just sick of joining servers that let pretty much anyone in
  youre comparing a shiny turd to a regular turd     the fact doesnt change that theyre both turds
  sounds like you didnt make it into the vetting server
  i actually did with a pretty shitty proof picture of a couple items and they let me in with no problem i left because i disliked the people in the server and felt like half the people there didnt wear the fashion as a fashion
  well all i did was answer the question  asked
    i left because i disliked the people   thats on you buddy    felt like half the people there didnt wear the fashion as a fashion  thats ur feefees not really the truth if you bothered to not be a stuck up cnut     what people also dont realise is that vetting having items and that vetting is not an unbreakable promise that you will stay in theres been people who have been kicked for being shitty    idk what makes you think youre special having 10 dresses is nothing being in the fashion for 2 years is nothing maybe you should make another vetting server so that we can join and laugh at you
  what is better a server full of crossposters with little to no lolita discussion or a server full of itas    neither
  id say the crossposter one is better because you can ignore the other channels in the ita server theres no escape
  sorry that i actually wear lolita almost daily and dont treat it like a costume for conventions i dont like people treating the fashion i love like something they wear as a costume with some ott nonsense  and yes having 10 dresses is nothing but your shitty vetting lets people who have like a minimum of 23 dresses in being in the fashion for 2 years is also nothing but better than letting newbies who have no clue about the fashion and have only been interested for 2 months into the server  its about experience and actual love for the fashion and wearing it casually/daily every single lolita server ive joined has a bunch of newbies in it that just annoy the fuck out of me because they dont know the most basic information about lolita and think buying a couple dresses makes them a lolita expert or theres the people that think casual or oldschool isnt real lolita
  why are people from the vetting server so angry all the time like are you this personally offended someone left your group really
  what the fuck are you talking about we barely even have ott coords     you must be roleplaying more dresses doesnt mean youre a better lolita than someone else being dressed well makes you a better lolita    newbies are everywhere what is important is that theyre willing to learn and unlike the ita pit theyre willing to invest       stop samefagging lol
  you should make the server have 3 coord pics and picture of 10 dresses as vetting
  not actually samefag quit reaching  i want people who have been in the fashion for a fair amount of time 2 years being the minimum and have a lot of experience thats all more dresses typically mean more experience in coording its very simple ive been in this fashion for the past 10 years im sick of being around people who treat lolita like a fad and dont really know what theyre talking about  theres nothing necessarily wrong with newbies im fine with people being new to the fashion but i dont personally want to have them in my server  i just want a server with experienced lolitas who have watched lolita grow and evolve over the years like i have and wear the fashion daily/almost daily/as work or school permits i dont want people who have been wearing the fashion every few months for only a year  sorry that some people think your vetting server is shitty dont get so offended    im considering it im sure trolls from the vetting server will come but i might set it up with a friend of mine
  i found fish fingers sorry youre not getting enough asspats from the happy place feels bad only being able to get into a group full of itas with your amazon wardrobe huh
  you want experienced lolitas but also with a minimum of 2 years which again is not a lot ok    you do realise most people cant even wear lolita on a daily basis because of work commitments    im not offended i really want you to make this server so it will actually just be the vetted server very much doubt youll get much other influx
  2 years isnt a lot but its better than 2 months  and i just said as work or school permits i understand some people cant wear it everyday thats why i said that
  so you do realise that people dont often have the chance to wear it often but yet choose to label yourself above them youre making no sense    if you want to make a super special server go ahead but for gods sake have some clear guidelines
  even people with extremely busy schedules have time to wear the fashion at least once a month   the people i label myself above in your terms are conlitas and people who wear the fashion twice a year and claim theyre such a lolita while owning like 2 dresses from taobao and i dont label myself above them i just dont think i get along with them and they wear lolita in a very different way than i do
  i literally dont know any of the regulars or in the server who match that description but maybe youre just looking for an excuse to start your own server
the problem isnt really vetting or not imo i like the oldschool lolita server and they dont have vetting i also love one of the cooking servers im in and they do have vetting it just depends on if you click with people there and if youre interested in the content of the channels on discord like everywhere on the internet 99 of the people are lurkers the other 1 is making the conversation and they pretty much decide the entire atmosphere of the server besides the channels and rules
  veterans server is live please apply only if you meet the requirements dont waste the mods time    
  thats excessive   what about capsule wardrobes
hello everyone    we have had a massive influx of new members and we are trying to pass as many experienced lolitas as possible     please do not sign up to the server unless you have your proof ready to go in the near future as you will be kicked within the next 48 hours if you havent submitted an application with proof    we have also had a few trolls try to join but fortunately we have deflected them they are now banned
  too bad
  how did you get that many responses to your post in 35 literal minutes on a monday night two days before halloween   the entire boards not even moving that fast theres what like maybe 15 active posters currently
  it looks like there are 25 people in the discord right now which would mean 250 coords to vet just because the board isnt moving quickly doesnt mean that there arent people lurking
  not a monday night for everyone in the world anon
  a lot of people from other timezones its what im guessing    we have had a fair amount of applications some from competing servers so its not surprising that word got out so fast
  is eggplant a troll that is the worst intro ive ever seen
  nah i checked her up personally she provided her ig and weibo as proof and had a wardrobe photo with her discord name    its safe to say that since this is a server originated on 4chan that we will have some  unique characters i dont plan to have a server which is 100 serious but if eggplant or anyone misbehaves in other channels i will give her a warning and in the future ban her
  only 1 of the people on the internet actively post there are 99 people watching this thread now but not posting
  who are the mods though how do we know they are legit
    lol what did she say
  i thought it was a joke      bittersweet meme
i suppose we can assume its no boys allowed either huh
  idk bro are you an experienced lolita
  seconding   who is the mod team post coords
  where do i join to get a cute seagull gf
  this before i join some veteran lolita server i wanna see what the mods dress like
  implying seagulls are cute
  im cute
  whether they want to post coords on here its up to them but they are are well known and well respected experienced members of the lolita discord community
  who are they
  ok not a mod but just theorizing here im guessing they are gulls just like all of us here and if they are vetting so hard why would they not be experienced lolitas i guess ill just join test it out if it sucks leave easy
  they are are well known and well respected experienced members of the lolita discord community  theres a difference between wellknown and respected and experienced if they are vetting so hard they should be held to the same standard
  well i dont think you really need to worry just join and see for your self
    if they were that well known and respected they wouldnt be scared of outing themselves
  why should they be scared to out themself when you can just join the server and look yourself
  it looks like the same team as the original vetting server i guess the other one crashed and burned
  they are really not the same people wtf are you talking about the vetting discord is fine too how could you even know if youre not in it
      it was a joke but i am a real person who does wear lolita if that helps
it would be really cool since theres such demand for this server if people actually posted in it nut up and show us some coords
  you first
  you say that here but aint got the balls to post it in the server huh
  why are you so anal about this like its a discord not joining a cult just check it out dont be a douche talk to people and see if its for you wait scratch that you sound like someone who doesnt want to make friends so maybe stay away
  why is everybody vegetables
  i was wondering that but i didnt want to ask
    is this a larping server
  as far as i can tell everyone there is an actual lolita
so im not in the vet server but like is there an open channel where everyone can post like a collage of some coords so you can see everyones skill level and style mods included i think that would be a nice idea help put a style to a name faces could be obscured obvi
  veggies are kawaii
  can you post an example this sounds complicated im no good at photoshop
  i want to be a cabbage a true friendo
  follow your dreams and be a cabbage
  sure im using pics of misako and some floords from instagram to illustrate my point   basically everyone could make something like this and post it in a dedicated server with a brief intro and the members can look back at it and check out your style  so like we could see our misakoclone likes reds and greys and leans to a more mature sweet style  and if everyone did that you could always look back at it and i dunno check to see if the girl giving you scathing crit on your oldschool motie coord wears exclusively 2012 ott sweet
  and by server i absolutely mean channel durrrr
  join the server and you can be the cabbage you always wanted to be
  that is a pretty neat idea idk how i feel about it being open though could have been a nice addition to the intros though
  there are some mediocre lolitas from the other servers but posting the sidebar breaks a rule probably
  i know you can just see if you join but it is really weird that they dont just want to post their usernames here since its already obvious they go here anyway
  
no offense but what is the point of discord especially one with mostly gulls lets be honest the reason most of you are here is because its on anon people who are used to posting on anon are not going to be active in a place where you have a set username the people who dont mind posting their name and face everywhere are already on facebook so they dont need discord either isnt it just for gamers
  youve clearly never used discord and no most lolitas comfortable with posting their face arent on facebook its essentially just a chat room with different channels so you can talk about whatever personally im not even on cgl just for the anonymity plenty of people i know post here and know i post as well its just nice to be able to have conversations with other lolitas that arent tempered by the need to be polite because your face/name is attached to what you say
  are you trolling or just stupid discord is just like skype but better
    i do use it for gaming are there also a bunch of lolita groups on skype then
  personally speaking ive found the discord as a good way to get actual concrit and help even experienced lolitas sometimes run into problems or want feedback and while the threads here are usually not very helpful the lolitas in the discord will be honest posting on fb isnt helpful either bc its usually just asspats and then boom you wind up getting shit talked in cgl id rather just ask a group of lolitas for concrit
why is everyone a fruit/veg      speaking of mediocre youre right why are funk and jennkitty in there
  im pretty sure you could set the permissions so you can see it as soon as you join the server but are unable to post in it until theyve vetted you and given you the role that lets you access the whole server that way it can also work as a preview so you know what youre getting into before you gain full access
  yeah why the fuck is funk there i thought this was for good lolitas
why do people always make temporary invites
    they probably fit the requirements of 10 main pieces and 2 years
  no one uses skype because weve all switched to discord lmao
  youre sort of treating this like youre an asset of some kind the server doesnt owe you anything     in the end if someone is so good and so far above everyone else they shouldnt be afraid of sharing photos to the mods or leaving if they find the place unsatisfying as other people have youre a great lolita i get it but you also come across as someone who is a bit cowardly
  why not just join and get vetted and look at the coordpics channel  a channel that already fucking exists to post pictures of ourselves lmfao  youre fucking autistic it takes 2 seconds to join/get vetted
  why is funk banned from almost every cgl server  someone mentioned it to me before but i have no idea why
  because hes a dumbass
  so you we used to have lolita groups on skype
  hes only banned from the vetted server lol
  thats not what autism is lol
  using lack of knowledge of 4chin slang as a counterpoint    definitely autistic this one
   huh ummmm
fine ill bite    i meant that people use discord to talk to their friends just like they did on skype       not going to be active in a place where you have a set username  the people who dont mind posting their name and face everywhere are already on facebook so they dont need discord either  do you plaster your name and face all over your discord then you could make your discord username something completely random and different from any other handle you have my discord is completely separate from my nonlolita social media  discord is overall better as a messenger service why would you use facebook to dm friends when you could use discord to do that and to also make new friends with a relative degree of anonymity
  excuse me what the fuck do u think this is amateur hour u think were fucking around here we are not this is a server where u need to have 10 coords not 9 or 8 and 2 years of experience not 1 year 11 months and so on i take this server very seriously i have put a loot of work and time to vet the best of the best the creme de la creme if u might say i am not fucking with anyone this is the definitive and the only veteran lolita discord and you will provide me witht eh photos of u will not waste my time or the mods time capiche bitch
  im not the person youre arguing with and again youre using autism wrong
  posting the sidebar doesnt break rules because youre not singling anyone out
  damn you have a vendetta go away autumn
  i am now convinced that either this thread or that server must be 99 larpers trying to stir shit
  sounds like same faggy inside joke
  im guessing this thread is full of larpers because everyone who has joined the discord has been awfully quiet
  if youre going to call people mediocre then you need to be posting coords on the server    i was genuinely interested in seeing coords from people who think theyre hot shit but so far only a couple of people have come to play suspicious desu
  i think its a bit of a drama/trolling server the introductions seem really fake ctp and puppet circus in 3 colourways yeah right and im the queen of sheba
  i think youre going to get a hard time getting people to post real introductions in a server that was started by this thread that was clearly posted in bad faith probably a collab between known bad actors jennkitty and funkbros
  neither of those people are mods of this new server take your vendetta to your server if you want to complain not sure why you hate them but its embarrassing at this point to call them out just block them and move on
  shes not even in the new server its embarrassing at this point just block her and move on
  mine was real ω
  not that it matters and im not that anon but yes for the record there were skype groups for cgl and for lolita in general that was like the bronze ages though i dont think anyone but discord themselves actually thinks discord is for gamers only anymore its just a more lightweight and enjoyable version of skype im in servers for everything from webcomics to friends groups to cooking to fuckin tarot if youre resistant to using it thats fine but i promise its gonna end up being like facebook was to livejournal where there comes a point that you are either on that platform or you arent actually connected to the community at large in any meaningful way
  yup i used discord for different friend groups  girlfriends college buddies content creation etc way better than skype literally had someone who worked at microsoft tell me not to use skype because it fucking sucks it just doesnt work sometimes a few years ago you could dox people just by knowing their skype username and get their ip from it facebook messenger sucks ass and you have privacy concerns there the different channels you can make in each discord server is reminiscent of teamspeak but with way more functionality text uploading files/images and shit is free  anonymous
  youre making this up no one said that they had ctp and pc in three colourways in the intros get better reading comprehension
  read the thread
  so far only a couple of people have come to play  thats exactly what i would expect of people who come here to shit on coords and will defend and justify their behavior to no end because they just absolutely neeeed to shit on people
  name fagging isnt completely anonymous tho
  did you know that theres a middle ground between being anonymous on 4chan and using social media connected to your name and face
  speaking of mediocre youre right why are funk and jennkitty in there      yeah why the fuck is funk there    message your complaints about the users to the mods in the server
  mod here  they met the requirements of 10 coords and 2years of experience as cgl requested cannot personally comment about my feelings on either
  the old school lolita server does have vetting actually
so if 2 years and 10 coords isnt making the kind of server that people are actually interested then what sort of vetting do you all actually want       what is their requirement
  same as the regular vetted cgl discord not the retard one up thread
  reread it apparently she has ctp in both colorways and puppet circus and iron gate disbelief unless proof photos are provided ill keep on thinking this is a joke i proved im real the mods should too
  yeah after seeing one of the mods literally posting her plans to troll some girl im really uncomfortable and think they should post some proof
  if youre uncomfortable about a minor joke please leave thanks
    i re read that good catch    mods should really pin their coords or something to the top of the coord thread     otherwise im not a fan of this server it seems like a more circlejerky version of cgl
  why so much focus on a bunch of people most discord mods are just there to clean up channels and make sure that its peaceful theyre not representatives lol
    its not an unreasonable request to post one old coord i dont see any coords from the mods yet despite them mucking about in all the other servers
  have is crossed your mind that they dont want to be under malicious scrutiny since you and others keep posting their discord activity on other servers on here its a tad creepy and obsessive
  this
    well i wont post my coord in the coords thread unless the mods are posting too something is really weird or shitty with this server
  coords thread  lol
  then leave lol
  cry about it then leave asap the mods will post coords whenever they want to we dont owe you shit    its also pretty obvious who you are and its laughable at this point reason is because 95 of the people there already know the mods are actual lolitas from other servers and have seen their coords before they wouldnt be there if they didnt know     you couldve got what you wanted and we wouldve posted coords if you werent so creepily obsessed about it
    theres at least two others here who arent happy so good luck singling people out i guess
  its pretty obvious who you are  who is it
  we are not singling anyone out if were doing nothing about it lol    theres only 45 people on there which havent seen or have known the mods for a while fewer that share servers with the mods its not that hard desu
everyone it would be nice if we had at least one bit of proof that its not a massive joke  mods omg so creepy and obsessive why do u want to sniff our panties so much jeez were under constant scrutiny you wouldnt know what thats like just leave the server if youre going to hold us to the slightest bit of critique    lol mods u so mad
  not involved with this shitshow at all but    could it be that the over the top omg why are you obsessed with me response is proof that is a massive joke
  im one of them i have no idea who these mods are to be honest
  i wouldnt want to be known as so and so from discord if anything getting branded is worse
    responding to a concern by going lol i know who ur11 is not a way to inspire confidence or new people to come to a server but have fun with it if you wanted your own secret club where you know everyone why bother advertising on here
  are you retarded                      its not a secret club it was made to appease these whiny anons and any other lurkers
    so youre admitting this is a troll server to appease these whiny anons
  confirmed retard why would it be a troll server because of that most of the other lolita discords were made to appease anons
    then why are you lashing out at other anons who want to know more about the mods its contradictory we just want to know if its a joke server or not and your over the top backlash is kind of embarrassing in itself
  are you seriously assuming all those posts are one person i posted  and  and that was it
    it still doesnt explain their attitude but thanks for butting in
  if you think its a joke server and cant trust the mods make your own that is not a joke and screen people yourself this one is probably going to die anyway as long as you super elite lolitas are too chickenshit to even chat
  yikes
  im not sure i have understood everything but imo if joining requires showing coords and dresses as proof i do think you owe these things to people who get to join its really weird mods would get to refrain from this and it really seems unequal for other members of the server
itt why we cant have nice things
  exactly this
    thank you for saying this its ridiculous that the mods are getting that defensive about this
  its a bit arrogant to think people who are in other servers with you must have automatically seen your pictures there and remembered your usernames as well
  i mean  and  recognized usernames so
ive only seen one or two mods coords but i dont think i know anymore because everyone is a fruit now it honestly doesnt matter to me its just a chat group yall taking it too seriously  if you want to see a mods coords just freaking ask
the way so many people are losing their shit over not seeing the mods coords and trashing the discord just because of that one thing absolutely reeks of people that dont meet the requirements it takes ten minutes to join and get verified and then you can check yourself
  how can you check if they didnt all post their coords lol
  dm  hey can i see your insta  yeah sure its blahblahblah
  just dm the mods privately and ask to see their coords thats what everyone did to get in the server nobodys required to post their coords in the public channels
sooo is there anyone who is satisfied with the new lolita server are the requirements too lax
  are the requirements too lax  i think theyre just fine 10 dresses in two years is a reasonable requirement the way some of these posters are acting youd think the mods said you have to have forty dresses and been in the fashion for a decade
  link is dead anon
  sips tea  nah this channel is pretty comfy and i love the banter
could i get invited to cgl/fa and the nanchatte rooms please
what do you think of the admins/mods of the servers listed here
you guys know who you are sips tea violently how dare you kick me out of the server i demand trial by combat to let me back in
  youre not getting your fish fingers anywhere near us
  it was comfy while it lasted yall will always have a comfy spot place in my heart
  does anyone have a link to the old school lolita server
joins several discord servers  all fatties and ugly trans even a mixture of trans fatty  guys pretending to be girls  all the rest of the servers are dead  there is a only decent one but they all already made they friendship circle
   fatties and ugly trans even a mixture of trans fatty   pretending to be girls    jc where did you join anon
  any public one
  maybe look for a sever that isnt linked on 4chan
  pigpen  ok
  i think the requirements are fine especially since they were tailored to the communitys wishes the attitude in there is not fine because nobody will post anything in there esp not coords though the ones posted are generally solid but people have been bitching in this thread the whole time
    look all the mods did was set up the server because people here wanted it if you got in why are you complaining that means the mods did their job they vetted you effectively and let you in the rest is in your hands senpai     since the vetting is relatively stringent but also straightforward the mods seem to be using a light touch so far if youre complaining about the mods then you probably didnt get in in the first place
   the rest of the servers are dead  they wouldnt be dead if you said anything or responded to anything other people said
  already made they friendship circle  theres still room thats the beauty of discord keep participating youll find your niche
    i mean i really was going to but after s very weird reaction i think ill see how things turn out first
im looking for a good vetted lolita server that has decent activity levels and a low numbers of itas and lolita roleplayers i know i have options here but the horror stories have me dissuaded i know a girl who came to a meet a few weeks ago had horrible problems with the vetted server she joined and made some posts and then the mods kicked her out because they thought she was someone else shes never caused any drama it was pretty sad to hear about how she was treated by them is the veteran server run by the same idiots
  why dont you make one
  veteran server is not run by same people but its dead quiet
i wish the updates server was active
  your friend was most likely kicked for inactivity and can rejoin     unless shes that diaper girl than please stay the f away     idk why /cgl/ thinks the vetted server bans everyone they just do regular inactivity purges which is not the same at all
  why do people take inactivity purges so personally its not a judgement against you if youre purged its purely that they want to keep an active discord
  im still in that server but out of curiosity why do inactivity purges im in a number of servers with over hundred inactive members and nobody gives a shit maybe someone is just busy for a few weeks but will be active again later it just seems like a lot of extra work
  well you dont know if those people are inactive because theyre just away for a bit or are serial lurkers/creeps so out they go bye
  ewww how tf did a diaper girl get in bad vetting
  shit happens the vetting is just to prove you have/wear lolita
  so she wanders in and starts dropping gross pics that doesnt just happen desu
  you know theyre lolitas because they were vetted
  ill bet 20 dollars that youre her and trying to get the dirt on how we found out youre an ageplaying diaper shitting freak
  desu ok    ive never been in the vetted server and im not going to join it im not even a lolita im a cosplayer  just wondering how dumb the mods are to let a diaper fag in and allow her to shit up a server   keep being salty frillfriends
  this sort of nasty attitude is why so many of us look at the vetted server with disdain youve got these grand expectations for behaviour and posting habits you have a high turnover rate because youve chosen your clique and you keep whinging and complaining about people not liking you so you turn on the defensive i left the server after it was found out that you allowed some fairly disgusting things to happen because it was all good salty fun make up your mind are you mean because youre insecure or are you insecure because you cant keep a friend
    nah dude shes dumb and used the same name she uses for other shit someone noticed who she was and she got banned    she wasnt screeching about pee pee poo poos everywhere just being a little weird and then someone put two and two together
  please those of you who think the vetted server are a bunch of bitches and all the other ones are shit and then come here asking for a good active server make your own server and vet it yourselves thats the only way you will get a server to your standards
  someone noticed who she was so you had two diaper shitters in the server and only kicked one desu did no one realize the person who noticed her needed to have some knowledge of diaper freak usernames to be able to pick that one out
  im not a mod so i dont know the details  plus im being vague on purpose because diaperchan goes on here
  4chan is a diaper for us all youre letting your shit out here too
  im going to start a wardrobe and get into the vetted server so i can experience this clusterfuck myself desu
  the inactivity purges are simply to promote activity i dont want to look at a member list and think who are these people    also whoever is white knighting the vetted server is being really annoying if people dont like it they dont like it who cares
  just start your own reeeeee    way to go youve proven some points here
  hey now some people who go on fetlife are into perfectly normal and respectable things like being choked and spat on
  what if someone just googled the username
  i was going to suggest that as something the mods should have done first but how often are you really going to google someone desu  maybe they were looking for an instagram or something you could be right
  kinda depressing desu i was in that server and fairly active for a few months but apparently got kicked out at some point just because i didnt say anything for a few weeks  the mentality isnt great either imo lots of people who dont dress near well enough for the amount of shit they talk and theres a few people with serious personality issues  server itself is still good probably the best place around for discussing the fashion without constant uwu luvlies bullshit as you get on facebook but a few drops of tar really spoil the pot of honey at times      have you ever been part of an actual online comm those creep names travel at the speed of light its common knowledge within a few days
  im surprised there isnt a public list posted of known diaper freaks
girls calm your tits could someone please send new links of servers i may join sips tea
  all of these except the fa x cgl one still work 
wow i got kick/ban from the  fashion x egl discord just because i was apart of a /r9k/ trans server a server that got deleted not fair at all    just because you found a freaking collage image of collected screencaps from our server proves nothingi didnt do anything wrong that collage was made by haters from 4chan server raidersand a competitive server there was so much drama because they were shilling lies about our server      in /r9cute/    there was no cp forced hrt pushing pink pill pedalling doxxing grooming cutting/suicide promotion or any other activities those wits have come up with to spawn drama on our beloved server it got us deleted    /sad
  yikes
  i mean to be fair can u blame them
  get owned lib
  being friends with pedophiles is not cute
  there was no any pedophiles at or pedophilia we didnt allow anything like that
  people bragged about the age cp images that they had just give up   in general its very cringe to be in a r9k server anyway let alone one like that
  going on /r9k/    no wonder you were banned
  nice homu
  cutting/suicide promotion  included in this pic are pictures of people saying cut my name into your skin and ill give you x  followed by images of said persons name cut into someones skin    hmmmmm
  oh wow kinda wish i saw this shit show go down
  its really easy to take screenshots then crop the images and put them together as a collage /titled welcome to /r9cute/ to throw everything out of context    you guys are literally being memed by a bunch of 4channers posting that image around various boards
  how in tarnation are you going to argue the absurd amount of images of self harm scars posted in the discord as out of context
  how can self harm scars be taken out of context
  stop using pedo syntaxys please
i just want a lolita discord that i can lurk and in which people will keep me updated with the new collections and good coords
  why lurk its social thing
  because no one likes a dude that is only in there because he likes to shitty draw lolitas design new lolita style clothing and learn what and what isnt ita as well as learn the current trends  im still learning how do fashion designers design a print and then apply it to a cloth pattern and then how it will look when it is wear    and no i dont like /fa/ i like lolita fashion jfashion and cyberpunk
  why not just lurk cgl then
  i already do but theres too much drama and too few source of what is an okay coord a bad coord and what is ita  too much people bitching about other people instead of posting pics of clothes talking about them and posting coords and giving opinions on them and so on
  too much drama  man up and lurk anyways cgl was 98 of my lolita education because everywhere else was too much of a hugbox to actually offer any advice or nonbasic information any worthwile lolita discord is full of lolitas who already know their way around the fashion and youll rarely get good crit or info there either
  man up and lurk anyways  thats the problem the servers that seems to be alive requires you to post whatever clothing you have or fill some info about yourself  who the fuck would let a dude lurkand maybe comment if x piece with y piece is ok if he isnt a brolita lolita and just like the fashion and drawing    any worthwile lolita discord is full of lolitas who already know their way around the fashion and youll rarely get good crit or info there either    then could you please recommend me some of these or other that would accept a nonlolita nonbrolita that just want to learn the fashion and how to make good coords  my main source of information is /cgl/ and /cgl/s question threads as im not that much to make some fake facebook/instagram/flickr/whatevergirlsusestoday to stalk a bunch of random people for their clothes and ask them what must be dumb questions            a lot of these ones needs some kind of proof of lolihood which i cant give  so it is either ask for discord lolita servers or go back to ask random people on /ic/ and /fa/ servers and as i said /fa/ and lolita/jfashion/cyberpunk dont mix well and in /ic/ they care more about my shitty technical drawing skills than actual cloth design and coords
  im not any of these anons but yay cyberpunk im an old school lolita most of the time but the rest of my time is dabbling in cyberpunky fashion
    what is an okay coord a bad coord and what is ita  its called having eyes anon it looks awful the materials are bad and the whole thing makes you wince its probably ita it looks pretty nice but unbalanced its probably what you would call a nitcpick it looks great then its probably a good coord  learn the current trends  yeah good luck its pretty obvious that /cgl/ has a really diverse taste most of what brands make today isnt what some lolitas want thats why we have oldschool and stuff it would be better if you made a thread asking what would lolitas want  shitty draw lolitas  we have a thread for that  too much people bitching about other people instead of posting pics of clothes talking about them and posting coords and giving opinions on them and so on  i dont go to the feels and ita threads and i get all my informations just ignore the obvious bait
  have you tried lurking the cof threads here
  ts called having eyes anon it looks awful the materials are bad and the whole thing makes you wince its probably ita it looks pretty nice but unbalanced its probably what you would call a nitcpick it looks great then its probably coord     there are things that i like and they are called ita and if i ask why generally no one bothers to asnwer    we have a thread for that  i know i posted there some times       im an old school lolita  example of my ignorance for me old school lolita is someone that dresses like out of gothic  lolita biblemanaged to download it from 1 to 37 and from 41 to 42 plus boudoir ensemble and extra 1 and 2  with which i started to get interested in lolita fashion and kera got me into jfashion cyberpunk is more because i fucking love scifi     ive been trying for years to make a space ship commander lolita uniform an official dress for formal occasions and a everyday including battledress  skirts and petticoats dont fare well in nullg or microgravity making the official dress the only one that is bearable and the everyday with the battledress modifications for nullg no atmosphere and boarding being a fuckup to try to keep it lolita    a space worth it cutsew with a nullg petticoat is a fuckup to design unless you throw lots of fiction in science fiction but at some moment im going to concede to rule of cool in this matter  but i will still work on it until i manage to do it      i lurk any lolita related /cgl/ thread as my mainly source of lolita fashion information and try to download some fashion magazines too and from time to timemainly when /cgl/ tells me x bran made new collection go the brands sites and see what they got  but anyway all the servers that look active require you to post some kind of proof of your lolihood or fill questionnaire to see if you are worth to be in said server  it sucks to be a man and not liking brolita just lolita and j fashion
      i already told you no secondlife furry roleplay kun    the lolita discords are for people who wear or want to wear lolita if youre not going to wear the fashion in real life youre not welcome end of story    theres plenty of lolita blogs you can read if you want to find information use a search engine and stop trying to intrude into our communities
  there is a server thats mainly about new releases and magazines that get automatically updated through a twitter bot and its pretty much dead so im sure they dont mind lurkers not sure what the name was but it was linked in this thread before
  im really not understanding your autism here  i want to draw lolitas  lurk draw thread  i want to know what is and isnt ita  lurk the ita thread  i want to see what good coords look like  lurk literally any insporelated thread or just go to cof and you get to see what people consider ita and good in the same fucking page    just lurkyou dont need to be in a discord for any of what youre saying nobody wants a random dude in the discord because they almost always inevitably end up being orbiters who come in just to lurk but then find a girl or two they fall for and go after just lurk /cgl/ itll fulfill every criteria you feel youre missing out on the discords are for people who are in the fashion to discuss without crossboarders or potential creepers    also some girls like talking about their fishy smelling hands and dont want boys reading in on that kind of conversation
    
   slurps tea all i ever did was give a guy some dating advice on that server and they have banish me too     tfw i miss they verbal abuse
  women wont let me into their fashion groups when i dont participate in the fashion  it sure is hard to be a man   if you really care about the fashion why dont you do what all of the actual lolitas do no one learns how to coord from fucking discord chats they actually read and learn about color balance construction materials the history of the fashion general principles of overall fashion and current/older styles they develop an actual sense of what lolita is and a sense of aesthetic that functions in and out of lolita people did this on lj long before things like discord chats existed there are countless resources for what you say you want its fucking obvious that what you really want is to be spoonfed and jerked off by pretty girls that know more than you
  omg you are making it sound so difficult lol i never did any of those things i literally just looked at the brand i liked and how they coord it and looked in the mirror to see what suits me
but then again i also get so confused when i see itas without petticoat or lolitas who dont use bloomers like seriously all you have to do is look at a japanese magazine or brand blog and do what they do  
goddamnit i just want a server to discuss cosplay and techniques all of the ones im in is pathetic and annoying orbiting/drama    what is up with people being 10x cringier in discord than on /cgl/ makes no sense
        thinks i havent been lurking /cgl/ for years  thinks i havent posted in the draw thread from time to time  thinks i dont download japanese fashion magazines for few years now    also lolita blogs are 50/50 some do coords that by /cgl/ standards would call ita some do nice coords some say its a lolita fashion blog and they post about everything but fashion all in a mixed bag and i have to follow them plus all the brand webpages i have bookmarked that i have to periodically check and the monthly magazines i need to scavenge from the internets to download     nobody wants a random dude in the discord because they almost always inevitably end up being orbiters who come in just to lurk but then find a girl or two they fall for and go after  the discords are for people who are in the fashion to discuss without crossboarders or potential creepers  ironic enough i do chip in discussions asks questions about possible coords and brand collections and i only can do that in /cgl/ because im an anon in here     i already know that the average internet lolita is too much like picrelatedand you girls are even proving more the saltmine you are personally to go to a discord server to discuss fashion as a dude and not get shitted upon endlessly even in the ontopic threads the lolita community drama bleeds to the point that derails some threads  and because i refuse to pretend that im a woman or anything else i just want a server i can just lurk    hell just look at all the angry salty yous im getting because i said im a dude        thanks im already in it  given the amount of salt im taking in here i guess i should do like in that server and program a python/c app that gets the twitter feeds and new arrival/newcollections out of the brand websites that would at least save me up the work of checking on them minus the how are the trends going but i guess ill just have to keep using /cgl/ for that
  bro youre getting salty over all those comments calm your balls you know the truth the truth that you were in that server just to orbit its ok all man have this beta mind set that if they orbit enough they will get laid also no one is gonna waste they time reading that everyone knows males arent humans were just objects that orbit around shedding money upon the goddessesslurps tea
  have you considered that these discords want proof of being a lolita because the people in them want to talk to other lolitas not random lurkers    youre not getting angry salty yous because youre a dude its because you arent actually part of the fashion youre getting pissy because youre not wanted in a discord for a community you arent a part of none of these discords owe it to you to let you in get over it
  slurps tea
  no you dont it was a bunch of forced drama created from nothing by bad actors you genuinely didnt miss out on anything of value
gosh it makes me sad that guys are treated this badly in lolita communities both because of the latent hate towards men and the fact that sometimes it really is justified given how many creeps there are
  we like men who actually wear the fashion we just arent interested in people lurking in our comms so they can use us for research man or woman
  see 
  uk/britgulls  active with a good crowd
  drawing doodles on paper do not make you part of the fashion there are guys who actually put their money where their mouth is and wear the fashion and theyre already in the discord lolita communities are fine with men just not witless bores who have nothing of substance to contribute
   its because you arent actually part of the fashion  ive been lurking /cgl/ for a few years now and doing the odd posting discussing or asking lolita related things and no one has ever told me that until now that i said im a dude      we like men who actually wear the fashion  not everyone can be mana  we just arent interested in people lurking in our comms so they can use us for research man or woman  i wouldnt only lurk in im platforms if you girls werent that antimales      that anon wasnt me by the way and unless you are another angry girl you are contradicting yourself with  lolita communities are fine with men just not witless bores who have nothing of substance to contribute  we like men who actually wear the fashion      nice one    now to wait for more yous telling me how much i am wrong and how i dont even deserve to browse and even less to post on /cgl/ and god forbid i keep drawing lolita or jfashion
  hey anon out of curiosity what exactly do you need from joining a discord
  read the thread
  great so i think  answers all your questions then please have a good day anon and eat well
  you seem clueless about what you are you are the same as lolitas at heart who the vetting is for  i know its shocking but lolitas that are on that server had to start somewhere too and no one held their hands all the time stop being entitled its not about you being a guy its about you being a moron
  you was banned because you suck you pathetic shitstain
  lurking to know about the latest newsas /cgl/ is slow at times and probably the occasional question about coords or a particular thing that i need a quick answer/opinion about itwhich in turn would be me mainly lurking and only participating when i need/want something      you seem clueless about what you are  indeed i am   stop being entitled its not about you being a guy its about you being a moron  according to that other anon is either me not being part of the fashion or not wearing lolita     now to wait more yous again about how wrong i am
  are you  in the screenshot
stop feeding this dude  hes either socially retarded or out for a laugh let him figure this shit out himself
  no im not that guy    they simply cant help themselves which is ironic because they answer me in other threads
  the fact that you think the only male lolita we like is mana means you are full of shit and have zero knowledge of the fashion and our culture     all that lurking and you still dont know shit     you kinda sound like an incel desu lol
meanie girls wont let me orbit them in their private discords  you just hate me because i am male  dumbass anons are still taking the bait 50 replies in    /cgl/ is a shitshow
would anyone be willing to create ana lternative fashion server and keep it alive all the ones i was in are dead
  like thinspo lolita
  more like typo
  did you talk in the dead ones all it takes is 1 person to start a conversation
  all it takes is 1 person to start a conversation  wish this was true anon 1 person can only make a monologue c
  you joke but half of cgl would join that community if it existed
  it takes one person to start silly dont expect someone else to start talking the exact same moment
  how was your day
      it isnt really a nasty attitude they just dont want to have to explain in detail because at least to me it seems completely reasonable     people would talk about things like their mental health and weight issues in the appropriate channels and then get shit talked on cgl for it the same reason you shouldnt add randoms on facebook anyone can creep and post your personal information     if the person posting people to cgl is an active member thats just twofaced theyre a slimy cunt but that is harder to account for than the possibility of shitstirring lurkers     you could argue that maybe tmi on a chat server with a lot of people on it is just a bad idea but having to be guarded about what you share and watch what you say isnt a great way to create any sense of community support and friendship
  i support kicking inactive members but god the off topic tmi and mental illness channel were why i left the vetting server some of them should spend more money on therapy than on brand lol i guess ill be a lonelita online too
    frequent 4chan use is a symptom of /a/utism
  it was actually a very productive day but the bad mood of the people i live with bring me down
  thats good to hear being productive is the basis of your existence of a human being  without getting shit done life is just a vapid unfulfilling experience that turns you into a husk  getting motivated can be hard but you can endure and do it not only for yourself but those ones around you i know thats tempting to just ignore and remove negative stimuli while you struggle yourself but think about how they suffer bad mood doesnt come from nothing  be an example of strong will to them and never let the circumstances dictate your emotional state    laugh against all odds even when the world is crying
  stop being such a dumb shitlord
     le high iq ad hominem     thank you for post anon youve really added a lot to the conversation i had to sit back in my chair for several minutes to ponder the implications of such a profound argument i thank you sir
i was thinking about creating a sfw discord server aimed at people who feel lonely or would like to make new friends it wouldnt be focused on lolita cosplay japanese culture etc but it would be for people with these interests people could share everyday pics thoughts and more generally chat with others about whatever staying anonymous would also be okay as long as the user takes part into the conversation    the server would have different private channels and every channel would be restricted to 510 individuals who could access that only channel and not the others this way people could get to know each other after 23 months inactive users would be kicked not from the server only from the private channels the active ones would randomly be redistributed among the channels basically you would change channel thus getting to know new people and maybe remeeting old ones this method is inteded to make things a little more interesting and different people shouldnt exchange contacts to chat on other platforms at least not from the start    i think this would be fun especially if you dont have any irl friend that shares your interests i would need 1 mod  at least 4 other people per private channel i think the discord can be opened with at least 2 private channels so 10 people but more would be better id also need some civility i dont like drama     if you are interested send me your discord username here  dont worry i wont be able to get any other info about you     when/if i get 10 people in ill open the server and get back to you
  i like this idea in theory but people arent going to stick around if they dont like the random people in the channel theyre assigned to first and theres always a chance they wouldve liked someone in another one without turning it into one big group after everyone has met one another feels kind of pointless and people will just leave if they make one or two good friends who theyre then not in the same channel as the way you want to do it is guaranteed to have people just exchange info and chat privately once they know who they like    also five people per channel isnt enough  consider timezones and peoples schedules if you want five active people per channel you need to actually have at least 15 members

anybody else get these types of messages understand that the 20 wouldve only saved her 6
  yeah just tell them to cancel and make the purchase again  otherwise tell them sorry
  i didnt know about the biggest sale weekend of the year    if you have shipped their item already tell them too bad but if you havent shipped it yet i guess you could refund them the 6 or whatever
  i had already shipped their item the previous day and i know they got the shipping notification from it
  let them know if they want a refund they can pay to ship it back and youll gladly refund them once you get the product back
i think there was a similar conversation a thread or so ago but how do you deal with fans/customers who are getting a little too personal i have a fan who ive been friendly towards but with i thought professional distance who has suddenly started to message me asking about my day and talking about theirs obviously trying to push things into friendship were both female so its not that creepy but since its out of the blue its still a bit creepy   i know this will come off as elitist or stuck up but im not interested in this type of relationship with most of my fans/customer base or anyone online really but i dont want to alienate them or make them feel bad by outright telling them im not interested in being friends with them i also simply dont have the time or energy to spend on this kind of online conversation since ive got a lot of other things going on so i cant just humor them and pretend like were friends while also trying to keep them at arms length    is there a way to make someone less interested in being friends with you without making it obvious that you dont want to be friends     sorry for making cgl my personal diary for a minute
  no but i did get have to talk to someone for 40 minutes because they didnt understand why a promo code wasnt working when the code was already applied     personally i would give them a special 20 off code for a future order or 6 in credits though 6 isnt that much anyway so i would also just refund them if they insisted on a refund
  asking about my day  a bit creepy    yikes she isnt the crazy one here    is there a way to make someone less interested in being friends with you without making it obvious that you dont want to be friends     if you dont want to talk to someone dont talk to them
  nayrt but someone who you arent interested in making friends with trying to small talk about stuff with the obvious intention of becoming buddies can be really uncomfortable and in a situation where the other person is essentially a fan of anons i can imagine that it can feel offputting or even a bit creepy if they just suddenly make the leap from a follower/mutual to acting like friends     if you dont want to completely ignore them its a good idea to reply to the messages only occasionally even just waiting for a day or so before you even read them also gives you a good reason to not reply to everything and just give a short answer as someone whos been on both the receiving and delivering end of this kind of interaction i can almost guarantee theyll give up after a bit and probably return to how things were   usually when someone tries to befriend you its because theyve gotten positive attention from you before and they want more of it so once they notice you arent interested in giving it they tend to back down
  god if they didnt say that last line about wishing you told them i would have happily given them a refund ive had like two poeple ask me for price adjustments but with absolutely no expectations or fault laying so i gave it to them since that is something i would appreciate from a store myself if they came to me like this idk how id respond why be a jerk and blame the store owner do they think thats going to make you feel bad lmao      agree with  just respond slow respond with short phrases that do not invite back and forth hows your day doing well thanks did you watch this show yea / no working on anything just the usual  etc
  someone who you arent interested in making friends with trying to small talk about stuff with the obvious intention of becoming buddies can be really uncomfortable    i cant believe gif related is actually accurate for some people  i cant imagine how you go through life when you think literally any form of conversation is creepy
  but with absolutely no expectations or fault laying so i gave it to them since that is something i would appreciate from a store myself  this ops not wrong and its their decision to handle it how they choose   customers are more likely to return if they feel you treat them as more than just a wallet tho i was a buyer in similar situation asked the artist about a sold out product was put top of a waiting list was cordial and polite in my messages waited months for restock and bought it immediately when i was notified by the artist a week later the artist had everything on discount sale and i felt like a dumbass lol i dont blame the artist but the situation turned me off from being a returning customer
  that gif doesnt make sense because girls are usually not creeped out by other girls despite being not attracted to them
  that situation sounds like it sucks but im not sure if it would turn me off personally its always a play between something being sold out and buying something for a lower price like yeah you might have been able to nab those items at a discount if you waited a week or those items might have sold out again and you would been left emptyhanded
  the situation where they previously had a sold out item but you asked them to restock it might have been an item that the artist no longer wanted to restock but since you were so patient they brought it back for you but they had excess because its no longer a product that sells as well as it used to and theyre discounting it to move inventory
    thanks my first instinct was to just ghost them but theyre a good customer so i didnt want to be an asshole ill make an effort      she isnt the crazy one here  i never said she was crazy just that it was a little creepy last message i got from her was about some fanfic weeks ago and wed only ever talked in the past about fandom things then yesterday she sent me multiple paragraphs about her day at work and asking about mine on one platform and a short note on a different platform im not as socially adept as most people but it feels very weird to me maybe shes going through something and shes reaching out but i just dont know how to let her know shes reaching out to the wrong person in the wrong way i try to be friendly with people but i just dont have the energy or desire to follow through with anybody and everybody who wants to have deeper discussions with me i dont think thats crazy but if you do well have to agree to disagree
  fan behavior fanatic behavior can be quite creepy its essentially a stranger coming up to you and acting like your friend and trying to engage with youoften constantly    not op but ive experienced it a lot ive also experienced regular commissioners becoming actual friends of mine so its not like its all creepy it just depends and i dont think op was saying all people who try to talk to you are creepy
what do you wanna bet 4 for 20 print guy is furiously shitting out tribute prints for stan lee and stephen hillenburg as we speak
  oh musecrap
  what do you guys think about predatory pricing anyways i feel like its only other artists that hate it but fans love it
  i think you only can afford if youre willing to never need anything from other artists and having them breathing down your neck
  undercutting obviously gets you more sales and cheaper prices obviously is a win for customers but are you really getting the most you could get from your sales    i mean youre actively losing money per sale because if you sell a print for 5 versus someone selling a similar sized print for 15 they only have to sell 1 while you have to sell 3 to get the same amount they did    the cheaper price might work out for more sales for you in general but you still might end up on the losing end if they sold 10 prints and you sold like 23 over an entire weekend plus you have to print more and if prints are like 10cents each you have to buy more stock compared to them but still only make about the same or maybe even less in the long run    having cheaper prints is only reasonable if youre a lower tier artist and its hard for you to move your artwork at market average price
  it depends even from a consumer pov i assume that the quality of your product is shittier if i see predatory pricing the only time ive seen someone with genuine talent and skill price that low was with that muddymelly girl everyone else i see at cons doing this have really fucking shitty art or are a studio aka proxy selling for like 5 different mediocre artists they get sales only through their dirt cheap prices and vast selection of fandoms because they cant compete through skill and innocation     i tabled next to one of these proxy 4 for 20 print tables before and while their giant price signs had a lot of people flocking to their table initially most of those people ended up not buying from them because the quality of art was actively shittier than other artists selling prints for 15 each one customer was at my table and about to buy one of my 15 prints when her friend was like oh hey did you see that booth its cheaper there and pointed to the proxy guys next to me who happened to have a print from the same fandom for 5 or 4 for 20 but the customer made a face and told her friend that the art was bad and immediately paid for my print instead     so in the end yeah youll be getting people with smaller budgets but people who can afford to spend will shop around for quality and also everything this anon said  the only reason to undercut is if you arent good enough to compete at the market price
  i agree with     my stuff is generally priced more than similar products sometimes way more and im perfectly happy not killing myself having to make a bunch of stuff while still making the same or more money
  not quite the same experience with this anon but similar a mutual who frequents at the events i table at keeps referring to me as her best friend to all of her friends acts very familiar with me when i dont know her on a personal level its just very weird to me i dont want to sour things and make things awkward at the events so i think i mostly have to suck it up and keep my distance since i have no interest in being friends with her and honestly i followed her back when she friended me inperson last year so i think ill just unfriend this girl really
  it only counts as predatory pricing if theyre specifically operating at a loss and then raise prices back up again after competition leaves which isnt the case here    this kind of price fixing that artists have been doing is teeechnically illegal not that anyone cares but i think people should keep that in mind especially whenever a bunch of artists gang up on another artist with whatever social pressure to adhere to whatever pricing structure
im tabling with a partner whos also selling as opposed to just a table helper for the first time should we just both keep a separate cash fanny pack with separate float or have one of us handle all the money and keep track of our sales in theory keeping it separate sounds easier and cleaner but i dont have the experience to know what actually works best irl
  yes keep your sales and cash float separated save yourselves the confusion later communicate whether its okay to handle a sale when someone is away if you guys are close friends or not but generally to be safe if you have to go away for a break or something take your cash float with you and have your partner tell any customers if they want to buy from you to come back later
  i keep my money seperate from my partners but if ever they are away from the table ill do the transaction for them and give change from my float
  price fixing isnt the same as market average because the entirety of aa isnt colluding to keep these prices its just competitive pricing    most artists choose to price at the average price but theres nothing stopping you from pricing higher or lower most folks cant pull off 20 a print unless youre a well known or highly skilled artist and others dont want to price lower because they want to get the maximum amount of money they could get per sale it just so happens the average value/price for an 11x17 print is 15 across the board so thats what everyone prices as but youll still find people selling their prints for 20 12 10 etc
  its true that since quality 11x17 prints sell fine at 15 it doesnt make much sense to sell them for less but i would argue against the nothing stopping you from selling lower when weve seen multiple times artists backlash against another artist selling good art for too cheap and its not out of concern for the artist or whatever its specifically because lower pricing becoming standard would hurt everyones profits
  i keep my pouch separate from my partners if they leave the table or i leave the table then the person leaving typically leaves the pouch with the other person behind the table that way its less dangerous if a thief tries to steal it from them while theyre unguarded/alone i use their pouch to do their transactions while they are away so i dont lose track of money    best is to write down all your sales though it gets tiring and after a while you kind of dont want to but keeping a good record is really important its hard esp when it gets busy though    i only table with people i trust tho/friends so if you arent very close to your partner then it depends on that as well
  nayrt but those are just the social repercussions you arent entitled to anyones friendship knowledge or time and if youre doing something actively harmful to me i have no reason to include you in my group orders or be friends with you
  ive seen artists drop the prices of their prints by a couple dollars when a con is really slow and they want to make their table back so its not really that out there
  unfortunately this is a commercial industry like any other and if part of being friends with someone means agreeing not to charge below a certain amount youve technically formed a trust
  thats not what that means at all i dont go around asking every single one of my friends to agree to a price point before i become friends with them youre reaching
  has everyone forgot that people can just choose not to buy prints if they feel like 15 is too high or prices are unfair    were not running businesses critical to human life we draw anime waifus and husbandos for gods sake and once people get tired of buying weeb shit there goes our entire business model    price fixing doesnt work for something that isnt completely necessary to live and since were not a huge artist hivemind were not all communicating to keep our prices the same either
imagine your art being so bad that you have to resort to price fixing to actually make money
  price fixing is an agreement written verbal or inferred from conduct among competitors that raises lowers or stabilizes prices or competitive terms generally the antitrust laws require that each company establish prices and other terms on its own without agreeing with a competitor when consumers make choices about what products and services to buy they expect that the price has been determined freely on the basis of supply and demand not by an agreement among competitors when competitors agree to restrict competition the result is often higher prices accordingly price fixing is a major concern of government antitrust enforcement  
    if anon wants to believe that aa is a price fixing conspiracy let them
do you think an ai automated coloring program would effect aa    
  nah not in a long while   judging from the sparse information in your link it sounds more like a tool for coloring sequential frames based on an already given color scheme so most likely its a glorified filltool for cel shading
  lol ai coloring has been around for ages try it yourself it sucks  
  hopefully  people need to focus more on creating their own style rather than the same bland coloring style you always see
with things being very tight on my schedule next year i was beginning to think i should stop taking small commissions at cons and outside of cons and just focus on large commissions and client work but then a part of me is thinking but what about that nice hunk of change you get from doing small commissions but at the same time they are not helping me at all portfolio or drawing wise im pretty torn i could use some insight on when its time to swap over to high end commissions only or if theres a way to balance it
  small time commissions are a waste of time you could spend the same amount of time designing a new print charm or pin that will earn you way more in the long run for usually less work prints more work but other things less    if you enjoy it then you know do whatever but profitability wise huge waste of time
  i used to take atcon commissions but i get fatigued easily and with commissions i had to stay up till 3am each con night to do them so i decided to sacrifice the extra money just to get some more hours of sleep
my tablemate is draining the hell out of me emotionally she constantly worries about every little thing and hey i worry a lot too but i dont make it a point to whine to her about it like she does to me im constantly having to assure her that things will be fine    how do i gently tell her to chill the fuck out
  if youre not close friends with her at a certain point you need to just say hey im not your therapist i cant talk you down every time you work yourself up into an anxious tizzy you need to deal with it yourself
  i have a friend whos kind of like that too but the more experience she gets the less she worries about everything so ideally your friend will also get more confident and stress less as you get more experience unless you both are old pros at tabling in which case shell probably never change and you might need to draw the line like  said
  i have a friend who does that too and when she does it slowly makes me anxious like i could be pretty confident about the upcoming show and she would just keep worrying her art is better than mine and it starts to affect my mindset    best thing is just to not do it gently lol at least if youre close id just straight up tell them chill the fuck out and give them some reasons why they shouldnt need to worry so much
  are yall in the actual aa that scared of selling your items youre actually that worried about making money in one convention
  tbqh i had a table mate like that and i just stopped tabling with her because i couldnt take it anymore
  this after a year i started tabling solo just because i could feel my tablemates nervous vibes affecting sales and my attitude during the day if talking to them about it doesnt work maybe move to solo tabling
  nayrt but i think its about more than just making money for a lot of people logistics making sure you dont forget anything having enough stock etc making convention cost is surely a big point ive been to cons i thought would be moderately legit and then no one showed up but its not always just that
  yes we get it anon one con is insignificant and youre very successful and special 
this finally the nail in tumblrs coffin
i dropped out of college and am now living temporarily rentfree with a friend is doing commissions and/or porn commissions the faster way to earn money or should i focus on making merchandise like prints and charms right off the bat i have about 12k on student loans and going into repayment six months from now assuming i could do welldone heavily rendered paintings with a bonus of uguu kawaii copy pasted sameface characters like yamio/hyannanatsus art is it realistic to expect a decent following and orders within that time frame even with consistent posting/portfolio building i want to do art fulltime but its kinda hard to start when i owe thousands of dollars for fucking nothing
  sounds like youre prone to bad decisions just get a job and do art on the side like the others like you
  just learn how to do furries they pay fucking bank for art
  possible but you would really have to commit and bust ass i would say long term viability you should make merchandise and my reasoning is     in the short term you could probably be well on your way to pay off loans if you hustle for furry/porn art but the art doesnt work for you in the longer term because they are one offs find a way to make your art continuously bring in money
question for yall  im trying to talk myself down from this wall of thinking that the only way im going to become a successful freelancer is by quitting my day job    does anyone else here have a full time nonart related job and still make decent bank off of art    i work a 128pm shift tuesdaysaturday stay up usually until midnight to work on art ive made decent progress but i still feel like my energy is wasted at my day job i get in week long ruts when i feel too tired to stay up and wind up sleeping instead of drawing i feel like to make any real /business/ progress having an etsy shop making commissions on time id have to cut down hours at work any tips on how to better manage time without getting burned out every couple months
  freelancers who have the autism and the drive to pump out commissions every week/every couple of days are the ones who make bank doing art not the parttimer who doodles on the side  a lot of people on /ic/ are on the same boat as you you can go check there and see how everyones doing
  anon i quit my job this spring and ive made 44k in profits since then   youre stupid if you keep your job and keep trying to draw to get somewhere youve got one life anon yolo swag fourtwenty blaze it
  fetish comics give ok pay per page itll honestly be less than if you got a retail job and used that to fund the art on the side ive been doing this for 5 years putting 612 hours a day into art commissions or promo and sometimes you just dont get there some months its 1k others 3k some none not everyone experiences that mega fame and good income art is one of those dont quit your day job things unless you want to do vector infographics id get a job you can stand doing then go home and put 4 more hours into doing art every day see where it gets you
  some months its 1k others 3k some none  nayrt but theres probably a reason why your art isnt selling all that well highschoolers who sell runoffthemill anniemay prints at the artist alley make more than that
is twitter seriously the only other place we can go now that tumblr committed suicide instagram is god awful for posting images that arent square or are high resolution and deviantart doesnt have the ability to upload multiple images in one submission  im on the edge of just being done with social media and just making my own website tired of all this bs
  a couple of my art friends are moving back to deviantart or newgrounds others are trying to go to some newer sites like pillowfort
  yea i hear everyone talk about pillowfort i think ill look into them once they get their site up  i checked out their twitter looks like they gained over 11k followers within 24 hours lel
  god the creators must be dancing at this whole situation lmao it must be great for them
  lmao maybe a couple do but most dont anon why are you here just trying to make people feel bad
  thats not true at all unless they get extremely lucky the average earnings from aa is 15k
  what i discovered about doing freelance between full time work was that i absolutely fucking hated drawing on command for idiots at this point im completely ok with doing some art on the side for aa little bits here and there for my own projects and hoarding enough money to retire as early as possible     it boils down to having enough capital to make choices that dont hinge on paying the bills and freelancing generally doesnt give you much choice because youre constantly hustling sometimes youre lucky/good enough to have consistent clientele and if youre smart with your finances you can also retire early but it really comes down to knowing yourself for me i dont want to be tight with my finances while still being able to sock away aggressively for retirement i like spending a lot of money on things like travel and toys and given all of that im fine with the tradeoff of full time with less time for art
  pillowfort is super hugboxy one of the features they brag the most about is the ability to delete other peoples reblogs of your posts pretty fucked up imo
  sounds great what i really didnt like about tumblr was that reblogs stay even after you delete your post
so is anyone willing to share a place to find commission work ive tapped out my tumblr/twitter reach the reddit ads as well as my facebook/discord/deviant groups i just feel the internet is so huge and those cant be the only places where people are willing to pay 15 for a chibi or a furry doodle any help its the holidays throw this tiny tim a turkey leg bone
  hey when it rains child porn it uhpours furry art    oh tumblr you fucked up so so sooo bad
  what i discovered about doing freelance between full time work was that i absolutely fucking hated drawing on command for idiots  im not even freelance and this is the main reason i never considered it i never did many commissions because i just didnt enjoy drawing for others i prefer having a full time job and drawing whatever i want during my spare time to having my full time job be drawing on command
so ive been trying to buy these shoes on bodylinetokyocojp/ for awhile but i cant figure this site out at all    how do i choose my shoe size when i click the color i want it shows 1 size i get this weird feeling that that only keep extremely low inventory on their merch and offer what they have if so thats a terrible way to run a website business    the site says free shipping right now but when i made a mock order im still being charged 25 dollars for shipping    there seems to be absolutely no way to contact them for help so im here hoping someone whos dealt with this before can help me  i really want these shoes by xmas thanks in advance
welcome to /cgl/ newfriend  first id suggest posting in the bodyline thread   but yeah that means the size you want is out of stock good luck  might be a better idea to find shoes on taobao  but the chances youll get them before christmas are basically zero
everytime a newfag posts a good thread goes to heaven
yeah for some reason bodyline is absolutely inept at stocking their online store their physical store is better stocked than their online store id recommend specifically antaina on taobao and im not sure but i think they ship overseas without a shopping service id like another gull to confirm this though
lol pleb
  just make a new one if a thread you liked died it happens
why is jodelle ferland the only known celebrity cosplayer
  literally who
  jodelle ferland  film and tv actress  
heres dante basco in cosplay
matt mercer
osric chau
daniel radcliffe
olivia munn
adrianne curry
  matt mercer was a cosplayer long before he was a voice actor if this not common knowledge
  adam savage loves cosplay and if he doesnt count as a celebrity that literal who definitely doesnt
  adam savage is cosplaying as well
obligatory
is jodelle even still relevant in 2018
  i got bad news for you
fbi edition    with the con wrapping up what were your favourite panels what did you cosplay and what cosplays did you like seeing it was nice to still seem some touhou done and there was a lot of bnha as usual did anything not meet your expectations
  the new animenychime was pretty cute
  thats just crunchyrolls himetan since they bankrolled the event if i remember correctly
  i know i was just remarking that the animenyc oc one is cute in her own right
  you know what youve done
most of my time was spent talking to friends or friends of friends outside of the dealers room/artists alley didnt even buy anything   i dont know why this con feels so much more social than other cons nice atmosphere desu   after parties were super fun too
  which afterparties were worth going to
  sexy nerds party was pretty lame dj sucked but legends was fucking lit as all hell
  legends  did they play a lot of weeb shit
    did they have legends last year
ive never seen a thread deleted when it was already autosaging what the hell happened
    some actual pedophiles came into the thread and it went to shit thats all you need to know and no one needs to discuss it further
  little bit of a little bit of b had just about the whole crowd dancing where compared to sexy nerds there was just a small group of autists dancing in front of the dj      i didnt go last year so im unsure
  sick of the fat bowsettes all look nasty as fuck   some really nice fate cosplay some meh seemed like most cosplay was really in the middle of the pack
    most were ok but a lot of the ette cosplays were very unrecognizable
  there were some hot bowsettes there i gotta say and chompettes and booettes
  small group of autists dancing   thanks for the warning anon  tbqh am an autismo that doesnt know how to dance myself so id rather melt into a larger dancing crowd
  if people like us dont show up it never becomes a large group of autists dancing
i went as rob lucci leopard form fromone piece and had an absolute fantastic time hosting the one piece meet up for 2 days and on sunday i got connected to so many companies as usual was so good i want to thank everyone who came on by and had a great time at the event and im so happy i got a lot of my friends shouted out by the media as well pic related is what i went as
  and heres one where funimation and vizmedia shouted us out and a funny one i had with a spiderman cosplayer 3 days of no sleep 6 and a half hours of body paint done with retouch ups for the bloody battle damaged version on the 2nd day and i couldnt reach out for my phone due to my claws but it was worth every single second
  honestly the only after party that were worth going to is sonicboomb0x because he always throws well organized events  a lot of space and activities to do other than drink i heard aftercon party was pretty well done
  senpai project parties are fun but i didnt make it to it this year
  i feel the same way anon
the petcon thing was great tho anytime you got sick of cute cosplays you got to look at cute dogs instead
  it really was a very nice atmosphere mainly because everyone was so excited to go to an event after nycc and you could actually move around the con as well as it being mostly a casual good experience the really only shit show was on friday because the staff was completely unprepared for the crowd to have happened vs last year so nobody could get into the show floor until 140pm and they didnt give anyone a pin at all even if you were a 1st attendee from last year but after that things were pretty smooth overall
  this is true too they throw some pretty chill events good looks on pointing that out also i gave this tip in the last thread but if you guys want anything from the show floor wait till the last hour or 30 minutes before it closes up because at that point they dont want any of that shit to pack up and luggage around so they start cutting the prices to 75 or just give you shit for free if youre chill
  the petcon was great because there were cute animals running around just next door but it sucked because i had to deal with allergies the entire con because of them    i hope theres gonna be a lot of photos of cosplayers posing with animals cause i havent seen them yet
  ive seen a lot of them on instagram actually
  ive seen an amaterasu actually it was sooooooo cute
    i really hope petcon wasnt free because id be fucking kicking myself if there was a free con full of cute pets to pet
  cr backed it last year too theyre involved with pretty much all conventions
  i saw them too
  awesome okami is one of my favorite games and seeing it done so cute and perfect made my con im so glad this turn out was amazing especially with stuff like this
  cute  u  t  e
  omg adorable  i hope there are others
  t h i s for the bowsette    its kind of a dead meme and most were overweight and did not rock it     as for the fate cosplay it was really varied in quality the saber arturia i think were the most consistently good but thats because you need to put in effort for the armor instead of buying some aliexpress shit which was 99 of the other ones
  it seemed like there wasnt a single bad touhou cosplay for once
  every bowsette and shitty variation of it looked fucking nasty
  nope it was like 80 for a day or 125130 for saturday and sunday    still had fucking photographers with light stands taking up spaces
  most people i know skip senpai project parties due to the bs the creator javier/ory does trying to start drama with sbb and his draws for attention like when he claimed to have cancer and shitting on djs that wont spin for his events anymore
  i remember you you was fantastic
  you sir does not have any love for them most of them were fine to me
anime nyc was much better in its second year i cosplayed as remilia scarlet on friday yohane fallen angel and school uniform yohane on sunday all costumes genderbends i was actaully surprised how much more recognition i got for my remilia costume this year i debuted it last year and had only a few people recognize it this time i had a ton of people asking for my picture which felt very nice i did go to one after party the legends one on saturday night a pretty good time for sure although i really wish this convention had more social things going on at the javits at night time as well would also be good to get some more panel rooms and panels going next time around as well the most fun i had was during our love live meetups and photoshoots i also had a guilty pleasure enjoying that anison dj booth and just cutting loose dancing dont know how to do those glowstick dances so just did my own regular dancing
  sick of fats in general way to many fucking fats this year
anyone go to the anisongs for us it was a concert for them it was karaoke night i dunno felt average
  i went friday night i did really enjoy it i wish it could have been longer i really came for nano and it made me very happy to hear her sing in person it was worth it to me i just would prefer to see her perform on her own sometime
one chance at like minded weeb gf  didnt do shit  dammit    and i saw some ugly ass dudes with fairly qt gfs i hate myself
  i am with you on this i honestly was going through some serious depression and still am it felt like whenever i saw a cute girl there was a guy closely tagging along with her really would love to have a girl into cosplay and anime like me still talked to new people made some new friends but everyones taken really this is the first time i have not been in a committed relationship in over 12 years and i really miss having someone to share my experiences with so while i had fun there was a big emptiness inside of me
  i thought the bowsette costumes were good but the people wearing them not so much     i cosplayed bowsette for nycc but at least i am skinny so it was a little less cringe
  yeah i just want a qt to share my hobbies with but an introverted weeb isnt going to be on a dating app
  yeah i was so excited to see so many good 2hus too bad i only stay at cons for around 23 hours i wish i could have talked to yall 2hu fans i was the chen on sat posted on last thread but it got deleted (((
  anon its hard for everyone    as much as i want an honest relationship really just even an innocent friendship im too damn socially awkward to make contact with people     i understand it should be easier because im a girl but keep your chin up social awkwardness gets us all so its not just you    hang in there
  youre right but an idle girl will still have options an idle boy dies alone    last year i saw so many people on their own an stuff this year nearly everyone was in groups cosplaying will help reach out to people so i wanna do that next year but at the same time i dont want to wait an entire year
  thats pretty incel of you dude dont go down that path youll end up hating yourself and everyone around you making any relationship inherently toxic for both people     i dont have much advice but you need to gain some self confidence before you even consider looking for a qtgf i have pretty low self confidence but this con was a blast because of all the complements i received in my outfit pic related
  trust me cosplaying doesnt help but finding a cosplay group way before the con will
  my confidence is fine ive actually boosted my confidence by jokingly boasting to my friend how amazing i am until part of me started to actually believe it    its just a matter of actually meeting people i know for a fact if i can actually meet a few qts ill get a partner in no time      thats true i wonder if theres nyc discords or something for this  tfw you see the chiaki you took a pic with last year again  shes chiaki again  shes pretty cute but was both with her mom and potentially underage so thats a nogo
  oh damn you were chen i heard that was a chen but never got to see her are you going to any other cons i am going to try and organize something for touhou fans at magfest next
  well it is possible to find introverts on dating apps but really i am not sure if i am ready to really do this i was just talking to my exgf and she recommended i use one of these sites at this point i would even take a best friend that i can share conventions with no matter what the gender just another human that gets me its weird i have plenty of friends but i dont feel like i have anyone in my life that really gets me
  nah thats fairly normal i got over it but in the past for awhile i had huge thing where i thought people were just pretending to be nice to me
  god i feel that im 19 and i go to cons with my mom because i dont have friends so i think maybe that intimidates some guys she may not be underage just lonely but i wouldnt take the risk although just talking to her is okay but if her mom gives you a weird stare just dip
  the pic i have with her from last year she looks genuinely happy which feels nice but this year she was a little too far away to get to and then i never saw her again i wonder how a hey can i get a pic with you again wouldve went down if she remembers its a killer reconnect if she doesnt im weird as shit
  the only con ill be going to except anyc/nycc will probably be axpo i dont really have many friends so i cant organize many condays at least i can pass axpo off as a vacation     i dont blame you for not seeing me though i only go for 23 hours i dont have anyone to hang out with
  wahhh wahhhhh im not constantly in a relationship   jesus christ how are people this sad that you cant have fun without having someone on your dick 24/7
  nayrt but to be fair we all need some kind of intimacy it isnt a sexual thing     feeling isolated from the rest of the world kind of sucks
  being in a relationship means nothing but sex  yikes dude
    wasnt even implying sex im talking about how even people who go to cons with friends will make themselves not enjoy it because they dont have a girlfriend to do it with constantly hopping into relationships is exactly what that dude does if its been 12 years since he hasnt been in one
  you cant have fun without having someone on your dick 24/7    okay anon
  guess i should have used a different word but literally just meant a metaphor for having to be around someone that youre dating
  im not saying youre wrong anon im also not saying the other anon is right i just understand his pain although i think friendship is the most important part to asserting yourself back into society which will eventually lead to healthy and more intimate relationships    i dont think someone should force themselves into a cycle of despair because they cant share their happiness with a qtgf but sometimes that attitude is more than i dont have a gf hurrdurr    it could also be a consequence of anomie since using a lack of intimate relations is an excuse for not looking at the core of the issue    if that makes sense im a bit tired so i tried my best sorry if it doesnt
  its not a sexual thing for me at all i am extremely lonely sexual needs can be taken care of solo i spent a lot of my life living together with someone sharing everything with them now i have nothing now i feel like there is a big void inside of me that cannot be filled
  i only had one relationship after my long term one ended i was basically married without being married things didnt work out and held on too long i honestly just want a best friend i can share cons with i am extremely depressed right now and just venting
  hey anon its okay    i havent made a real friend since middleschool and have been going to cons with my mom since i dont have any friend im literally a sophomore in uni ik its sad    but you know i have faith that someday we can all find a best friend maybe the time just isnt here yet hang in there and dont beat yourself up youre not the only one going through a lot of pain     i know its hard to enjoy thing when youre doing it alone especially when you see everyone else in groups although i can admit that sometimes its my fault for being too scared to get close to people again assert yourself anon join some forums and discords play some vidya and get in voice chat we all need some interaction
  thank you so much for helping me and my girlfriend out to get free stuff at the con i was completely lost in where everything was but you seriously went out of your way to help us and bought us food too on another note how the hell did you learn to do luccis voice on point
  well i know you will find some friends out there too i had some seriously crippling social anxiety up until a few years ago when i forced myself to just start talking to random people more its good that you at least have a good relationship with your family and they are supporting you i do feel like i am whining a lot but its really like i had something inside of me get ripped out you have a good idea with even just doing discord voice chats i havent done that in a while and it is nice to just talk and vent out to people i feel like with a lot of my friends i am just bothering them all the time at least here i can just post anonymous and not worry if i irritate someone
fuck having a relationship i just want a friend
  i went alone last year and had a good time how was it this year i couldnt muster up the interest to go again this year for some reason
  i went with friends but spent 50 of my time wandering alone and it was fun
had a pretty sweet time at the con and it was my first time at animenyc mostly just wandered and hung out with friends but it was really fun i like it here much more than nycc i wish the game corner was a bit bigger as well as more games so theres fewer long lines and i wish more smaller panels were happening at the lower levels of the con but it was a defiantly enjoyable saturday im absolutely coming next year for all 3 days    i still cant believe me and this dude young_nandos_artlife got put on the animenyc instagram page
  i remember you you were awesome man and i met your boy as well we have a pic together on ig and im glad you got featured your cosplay was so good man and please do come by all 3 days any other cons you plan on going as
    thanks man i appreciate it so far i only have kotoricon in gloucouster townshipnj in january after that ive got animenext for all 3 days of that in june so thats looking good
  thank you so much it was a lot of sat up for it since i got painted at the event but it was 100 worth it and i had nothing but energy throughout the event what did you go as if you dont mind me asking and did you enjoy the event    hey youre very welcome one of the many reasons why i love the events is meeting new people and showing them the ways of the free stuff as well as the events glad you had a great time and ive been living in japan for a good while now due to my line of work plus i always loved the technique of voice acting so i studied tomokazu sekis voice while reading  watching one piece and just got the hang of it i can also do laws voice spot on too so thank you so much for the compliment
  sounds like a pretty solid lineup man im going to acecomiccon in january then katsucon then sdcc and then evo pax and of course nycc and animenyc and heres the pic of your boy you mentioned and i at the bandai booth did you get any merch from the show floor oh did you join the naturo meet up as well
    i didnt really get any merch i didnt know what to buy and i ended up leaving empty handed haha i joined the naruto meet up but pretty late i almost missed it because the train i was on came to nyc later than i anticipated i really shouldve gone earlier and i also had to get changed but i got there just in time and i had a nice time     i also really loved your lucci cosplay its so sweet
  i got a lot of free stuff and a lot of the vendors gave me free stuff after the con was over i got some naturo merch such as pins posters and a few figures so if you want anything let me know and ill give it to you bro yeah the trains were murder this weekend mixed with the snow cold and the mta always messing up on the weekends due to repairs glad you honestly made it man and thank you so much for the compliment it was so much fun doing it and leading the meet up to so many events and surprising vampybitme too but hell claws are a bitch to wear i couldnt get my phone out for nothing
    i had so much fun at the final fantasy photoshoot
    no prob man im glad i came so happy it wasnt snowing all weekend if you have an instagram id love to follow you
  i heard it was so friendly too glad you had fun my friends went as auron and sephiroth     i definitely do man my ig is tdoza
  oh werent you at the perez play party   did you like it or did you think it was pretty lame
    ooh i saw sephiroth we were in ff7 portion of the shoot together
  too depressed to talk to anyone  cant hold a conversation because of depression    its like im stuck in a loop
are there any other conventions around nyc that are worth going to aside from nycc/animenyc
  id like to know this as well i dont want to have to wait a year to do more weebshit
    the only other nyc con that i know of is liberty city which is ass even as a local dont bother traveling    threres anime next as well which is in atlantic city nj not exactly nyc but its somewhat close fun con right next to the beach where you can gamble your buyfag money away if you want to
  what about non con stuff just events
  i actually really like castle point anime convention but its not for everyone its a more chill atmosphere and i find it to be more social they dont get big industry names its more of a fan run con for fans reminds me more of the old days
this was my second time attending and while i had fun something felt off the whole weekend compared to last year my friends and i were discussing it before we separated but we couldnt put our fingers on it    on a positive i got stopped a lot for pictures each day that i went thats never happened before if any of you are on here thank you for making my weekend
  boroughcon  though its skipping 2019  heliosphere  if you like old school science fiction cons  liberty con and blazecon and play nyc  for the last two years theyve all been scheduled for the same weekend so pick one lovely that in this huge city they have to schedule all the cons at the same time    most area cons seem to be in new jersey not in the city
      might be interested in castle point since i can travel to the meadowlands for consecutive day with no problem    atlantic city is a different story would probably need to get a hotel room for it    might check out some local cons as well but how much of a downgrade is liberty con from something bigger like animenyc
  some of it could just be that chasing the dragon thing but the afterparty being moved around wasnt really a great idea and apparently it was badly coordinated i ended up talking to one of the djs on the subway afterwards and he said he didnt know there were other djs slated for that evening
had a lot of fun was cosplaying for the first time in years and had a lot of fun but i was a bit surprised that there was only a handful of other madoka cosplayers i was homura and got to bump into a madoka who got super excited about my supergroupies homuhomu purse it was fun just bumping into small talk opportunities like that and i dont think i was so open to small talk in the past when i visited cons more frequently
i wonder how many weebs got these not knowing that these are chinese and that 紳士 does actually exist in japanese but means gentleman is pronounced shinshi and doesnt even look anything remotely close to 変態 hentai
  want to announce to the world that youre a degenerate pervert  we tricked the stupid gweilo now everyone will think hes a good honorable person instead
    i got you homies so the only nyc cons left for this year are wintercon which i hear is very hit and miss i went there in 2014 and had a great time but its very small theres walker stalker thats gotten really big over the years has a lot of tv/netflix show celebs as guests and the turn out is huge after that in 2019 theres big apple con which is a really small area and no ac east coast comic con which is actually pretty good and like someone else said theres anime next as well
  i saw you you were such a chill person to talk to and everything i wanted a pic with you but we both got so swamped with people wanting pics with us and everything i was the lucci
  i saw your chen in the last thread its a shame you werent around longer we missed you on saturday do you have an instagram so we can see more pics of your costume
  do you happen to have the pic you took with my marisa cosplay
  dude if you ever need anyone to hang out with ill gladly hang with you and introduce you to so many of my friends i always go alone at the cons because i love meeting old and new people animenyc is the only con ive went with someone else this year and that was with my bodypainter and my girlfriend and had a blast dont worry about going alone you can make friends with so many people there just by saying hi most of the cons like animenyc are really friendly and chill overall
  small talk takes you so far in places like that i cant stres that enough everyone there is really friendly and just want someone to talk to about anything i understand people getting nervous around others but they are just as nervous as you too just enjoy yourself and youll make a lot of new friends easily
  says hentai  reads as gentleman  i cant help but wonder if this was completely intentional
just got off the phone with the main staff and owner of animenyc yeah we are so expanding the show floor next year we didnt expect it to be as big as it was especially sunday of all days so thats being expanded if theres any other stuff or feedback you guys got about animenyc please feel free to state it and ill address it to the owner and main show floor staff
  get more japanese niggas to show up
    if theres any way to make the game corner part of the con bigger thatd be sweet everything around it felt way too cramped and there were ton of huge lines for a lot of the games
    does anyone know who the punk marisa was with the light up mini hakkero was or have a shot of her i wasnt able to get a photo and didnt see her again but she was cute
  let volunteers make more panels  bigger game room  thats really all thats needed
    seconding a bigger game room i never even played the games there because the lines for everything were ridiculous    a dedicated gaming area would be fantastic
  more variation in aa it felt like over 90 of tables were just print artists
  i do but its on my mothers phone i can post it as soon as i get a hold of it
  remove photographers with light stands especially the ones without badges that were standing there charging people to shoot
  キタッ
  didnt get her name but it was fukkin awesome
  have the game room not be in the back of the dealers room    have the game room not close at 7pm on a saturday
  better security i got my badge checked once the entire weekend the bag check was a joke too when my friends and i got food outside and came back for the masqurade the security told us we werent allowed back inside although it was only 830 and the con closed at 10
  oh she was actually the official acp fate saber this weekend as well
  oh i talked to her when she was in her saber cosplay i think im pretty sure she browses here
  actually talking to them now about getting the voice actors from japan to come on down to animenyc mr dbz loved being there so we want to get more people there like the one piece/naturo/mha voice actors ill definitely invest in money for that to happen     i feel you on this and mentioned this to peter too which is why we are expanding for sure the game room will definitely be bigger next year and im going to make that a huge focal point to the staff thanks for bringing this up   got you for this thank you for letting me know this     oh this one im definitely bringing up im cool with most of the aa but i understand why variations need to be done     i actually heard about this right before baggage check correct yeah staff didnt check shit on day 1 actually so people could get in the building without a badge     this is also a huge thing im pointing out to them so thanks for letting me know     thats mad weird im extremely tight with the security and usually they dont do that let me guess you got the fussy old lady right she was a pain and even the security staff wasnt happy with her     if theres anything else you guys need to share please let me know should i drop my contact info as well in case you guys want an update on it i mostly just use ig though
  your shots are always a pleasure to see please post more
  better variety of official meetups    the fact that they have an overwatch and an aggretsuko meetup and neither a one piece fate or naruto meetup is insane given how popular those three series are and how overwatch is not anime    maybe hire several official photogs to take pics of the meetup and other poses and post it on the animenyc insta i feel like it would be very doable    anything to promote more people making costumes would be a huge plus in my book so i would love that honestly i feel like i saw far less people either cosplay or handmake theirs this year compared to last year
  i have an insta but youll hate me if i hand it out sorry anon
  promise not to i just want to see more cute touhourelated anything
  gonna post more
  your cosplays both look so well made the detailing on marisas dress looks really nice and chens dress and little hat looks great too
  i am definitely stressing this hard in a way im glad one piece didnt have an official meet up since my meet up with them i hosted got us featured by funimation vizmedia and vampybitme and other media sites but there seriously should of been one thanks for pointing this out
  and to address your other points official photographers i can definitely get a hold of for this event i mostly got in contact with the news and website media so that everyone had a better chance of getting featured in videos and pics but ill definitely add to this
  this is so adorable your cosplay is so good
  going slowly because i want to make sure theyre all retouched first especially to make sure there are no rotation issues
  the skirt on that marisa is so long it looks like someone put cotton hill in a dress
  the entire con i saw exactly zero kemono friends cosplayers which was kind of surprising didnt think it would crater in popularity that hard      i remember on friday before petcon started someone was cosplaying as lillie and carrying around a really miserable looking chihuahua      ny japan society the guys who were doing a bunch of raffles organizes all sorts of stuff year round    you have to make programmes event schedules and maps easier to find  i only saw programmes being given out in the artist alley and from a box in an empty event room between panels i ended up missing the guest event and signing i was most hyped for because i didnt realize it was scheduled for friday afternoon
  oh i feel you on that man you seriously take some amazing shots is there any site i can follow your work
  this alongside the arcade issue is the 1st two things i let them know about immediately i told them many times that they need better programmes and to put the location of each place at many spots not just at the 2nd floor where the starbucks was that was a pain for everyone and its why i was directing everyone to go to where they needed to go because the volunteers werent told shit much less the crew ill be sure to get this done for next year
  one of my favsidk who the mascot was but it was cute
  i feel like i saw far less people either cosplay or handmake theirs this year compared to last year  i mean it snowed a day before
  yeah taking a two hour bus ride in cosplay wasnt fun
  you realize how long marisas skirt is sometimes drawn right anon sometimes it hits just above her socks 2hu aint that consistent give him a break
  oh thats my friend on ig actually lovenikki_mobile ill let her know about this too
also im so glad my friend went viral due to his genos cosplay     if anyone has pics of him please share them
  yeah there plus later on the weekend they moved to the side between anime nyc and petcon should just ban light stands period its a fire hazard
ton of photos on instagram if you check the animenyc and animenyc2018 tags
    yeah i was im gonna be honest i dont think it was all that       i have a good hunch the big problem was that the venue changed from either friday to saturday from a brooklyn venue to the one in manhattan or both because i remember one person saying something about the venue change from friday to saturday    i guess people just didnt like the change because previously they were at capacity and tickets were sold out had they stayed with the original venue more people may have came even if it is a hike from javits to brooklyn      hope they can do a bit better next year
        i got her ig when she was in saber its artoriagrey
    perez play events are known for being incredibly shitty and the organizer spams her shit like no tomorrow i blocked her because i was sick of seeing her constant advertisements
  ok now im pretty sure youre being sarcastic as opposed to just having bad taste in photography
    darn did anyone else go to one of their events what was it like
  yeah it almost felt like i didnt even have to buy the badge desu i wanted to test it and kept my badge hidden to see if they would ask for it  they only did on sunday
  imo the game room should be one of the last things to close people often like chilling there when theyre done for the day and having it close at the same time as everything else puts pressure on people spending more time playing than enjoying the rest of the con i know that i usually go to the game room of cons when im tired of walking out and about and just wanna chill usually after exhibition halls/dealers rooms close
  im actually not being sarcastic i genuinely like your shots and want to follow your progress
    fully agree with you anon i like chilling with friends to play tabletop games at cons when im pretty much done for the day but that wasnt really an option here unless we used someones hotel room
  i also blocked the organizer because i was sick of being spammed from her i specifically protest anyone that uses those kinds of strategies on me
  there needs to be an entire room dedicated as a game room and not just with arcades game rooms help make the conventions feel more fun casual and social the arcade games were also so crowded it was a 1 hour wait for taiko so i only played once
  your rin is way too cute
    yeah it was pretty fucking lame imo there was a 30 door fee and they wanted 2 for a can of soda and 5 for treats and they wanted collateral to use some of the consoles they had set up i plan on staying far away from them from now on
take pic of lana rain cause i like beatrice  didnt recognize her as lana rain until after her card was handed to me
  does she not have orbiters running around her at all times
  nayrt but im just surprised she has enough confidence to hand out pornbusiness cards that just sounds super awkward to me
  she has almost 200k followers on twitter and is making bank i dont think she gives a shit
  no i mean she has the potential to hand them out to underages
  i wasnt thinking that either anon yikes
  perezplay is just cringey there was a whole thing about her claiming she was sexually molested by some local photographers while she was defending emcp there was the issue of the money from one of her event raffles being used to fund a vacation for her family she tried to charge people a monthly fee to join some promotion list where they would feature someones instagram and it would be randomly chosen i remember one of her door prizes at an event was to win a date with a cosplay guest one that was pregnant at the time too but wasnt showing yet if i recall as i saw the cosplayer a few weeks later at another con and they were showing
  bitch charged me 30 at the door
  well theres nothing to follow this is all just stuff done on a crap phone camera and retouched slightly i have family who were semiprofessional photographers and i used to edit for them but none of these shots conform to even basic rules of composition im just trying to record examples of cosplays that people did
  not the person youre replying to but i actually prefer photos like yours rather than professional tier cameras for some reason it feels more authentic and a lot of the people that were there really were just happy they got someone to take a pic of them than worrying about picture quality
  a speed dating event for awkward weeaboo betas like me
  can we get a maid cafe i would love to join if there is one
  didnt they have one last year or maybe it was for a nycc i cant remember
  i dont recall there being a maid cafe last year or this year
  this was brought up before but was axed when the whole cosplay is not consent thing went down so pretty much nobody wants to deal with that shit in the the staff     maid cafe actually has been discussed since we want to make more room for events like that but again it really does depend on how people feel about it in the staff
  push for the speed dating thing again that actually sounds fun
    second for speed dating that sounds like fun and also an easier way to socialize
  so instead theyre going to deny sexual agency to thousands of adults because of a few fucktards who cant be trusted with something as simple as not committing a class a misdemeanor in public in broad daylight    seriously what the fuck is wrong with our society
  eh depends on the cosplayer    definitely more bowsettes than i expected though
  bowsette literally wears a dress why does everyone got to thot it up
  speed dating is a cool idea until youre forced to be nice to the hamplanet you got paired with
  i dont know wish i would have taken photos of some good bowsettes but youll just have to make due with these
  we   live  in  a  society
  the irony is that this kind of behavior only breeds more abuse since only those who are bold enough to take risks are the ones who will succeed as in the ones who dont give a fuck about your consent while those who are more timid will remain lonely
  garterbelts are meant to be worn around your natural waist what is wrong with people
  because thats what people want you and i both know the cosplay isnt consent thing is just a reskinned edition of its creepy when todd does it but id love if chad did it thing what they mean with cosplay isnt consent is if a hot guy started coming onto me because of my obviously sexualized and revealing cosplay id be all game but not if that pathetic loser who stammers when asking for a pic tries
  because theyre too lazy to make an actual cosplay but want to be attention whores so they go for the most recent sexualized trend see costumes like harley quinn post suicide squad thats easy to closet cosplay i bet all of that shit was already in her wardrobe and all she had to do was make the wrist cuffs and crown
  more variety in aa but less vendors/artists over all sales were slow as is and there was just too many people selling and not enough people buying the aa doesnt need mostly print artists get some crafters or apparel artists something
  just saying the swallowtail guys have come to the us a couple of times they would be neat to have
  also artists with western art were pretty much ignored and while i feel bad for them cause they looked depressed as shit it makes sense
  damn dude you sound actually crazy   t remember going to a few speed dating events at cons in the late 00s and you know what they sucked even for fun they sucked there would always be far more guys than women that showed up to these things like 8 to 1 maybe it was painful watching the organizers try to make it seem like there was an sort of balance most of the time i dipped out since it went from fun thing to try at con to an embarrassing to watch waste of time    but no speed dating even was as bad as a panel i attended once something along the lines of dating for otakus hosted by a couple who said they were both each others first relationship as teens and they didnt have any advice on how to actually start dating someone
  go away incel      all of this speed dating things are always awkward and weird theres never a correct way to do them    if some version of this is bound to happen speed friending is much better everyone meets each other regardless of gender and you can find out if you have anything in common with anyone its still cringeworthy but at least its not awkward too
  i think the issue is that none of it really looked that nice iirc one of the better ones was the avas demon chick
  sure but not many people are going to an anime convention for a picture of batman they should go to nycc
  speed freinding sounds like it could be fun in theory but you will get fucks like  shitting themselves when they get friendzoned   but incel anon ill let you know from experience since you sound 17 and you need to be 18 to post that if you cut your fucked up attitude out youll have a better time in life in general
  aight incel but i agree cosplay is not consent is overrated although it exists because its not uncommon to get groped during a photo thats an issue
  you sound like an asshole      ok these are legitimately good reasons not to have a speed dating event but that should be orthogonal to the question of whether people can keep their paws off other peoples bodies
  id buy her quartz
anyone who bought those ahegao shirts/merch are straight up tools    and too many fucking nerds at this con
  and too many fucking nerds at this con
  and too many fucking nerds at this con  complaining about nerds at an anime convention     get a load of this retard
  thats their fault its called knowing your market
  ugh this fat cow
are cosplay orgies still a thing at cons
  good   western shit pls go
  this youre a cornball if you walk around with that shit on its no longer funny or unique youre just some loser following a meme trend
  thats the gist of it remember a lot of companies dont want to deal with even one ounce of negative consequences like that because it will lead to a twitter tantrum and companies will pull out for the next con if shit hits the fan that way       ill try homies but i dont know if the staff will go for it but ill definitely ask them they actually do like the idea of expanding the arcade and leaving it open after the con is over though ill report back when we all iron out the details
  yes there is but you got to really scrape the bottom of the barrel to get them which is why nobody really talks about them everyone thinks cosplay orgies is full of 10/10 guys/girls banging it out thats not the case at all
  really scrape the bottom of the barrel to get them  what did this gull mean by this
          amazing how many people jumped on the incel boat funny thing is im not the kind of guy girls are turning down i just know bullshit when i see it im exactly the kind of guy who will hit on someones cosplay and have them in my room later that night a decent percentage of the time its why i know the cosplay isnt consent thing is bullshit first hand from playing the game if theyre interested theyll be fine with it if theyre not theyll be offended     i dont waste my time on anyone whos not immediately showing mutual interest and you can gauge that interest before you even go in hard for them anyway
  not to mention theyre all just overpriced at 3x markup from where the sellers got them taobao/aliexpress
  means its the bottom of the bottom not full of hot guys and girls like people think but nasty gross stinky shit
  what i mean is that you got to go really into the weirdest most awkward group in order to get it im talking about those who have no sense of hygiene dont take any amount of care of themselves etc is an orgy worth that
  pretty much this you worded it better than i did thanks anon yeah orgies are exactly like this cosplay wise
  youre missing the point of the cosplay isnt consent thing by a mile its about not making assumptions or touching someone inappropriately because of how theyre dressed like if someone is wearing a very revealing cosplay or dressing up like a character who might be known for being slutty not assuming those things about that person and speaking to them/touching them in a way they havent agreed to    im exactly the kind of guy who will hit on someones cosplay and have them in my room later that night a decent percentage of the time    lmao ok
  and you can gauge that interest before you even go in hard  like how
  if someone is wearing a very revealing cosplay or dressing up like a character who might be known for being slutty not assuming those things about that person and speaking to them/touching them in a way they havent agreed to    they will agree to it if they like you and are available
  most orgies in general anon but yeah people who think orgies are full of hot people banging like animals are reallllyyy out of touch with whats actually happening its usually hosted by the most smelliest fattest person filled with their clique and the ratio to guys/girls is really 51 ive heard many many many horror stories about them and know 3 people whove attended them all have taken a trip to the hospital due to it
  tfw formerly fat uggo into semi /fit/ somewhat passable guy  holy shit what a difference in how basically everyone treats you not even larping
  subtle social cues you come to understand them with enough exposure just like how you come to understand the proper rules of grammar for your native language intuitively through enough exposure when you hear an incorrect sentence like    i not feeling the best of my ways at the current timing you know it sounds wrong even if you cant properly explain in detail where the problems are someone who studies english professionally could probably pick at exactly what makes it wrong with explanation but most of us dont have to do that to just inherently know its incorrect    things like the tone of voice where their eyes are focused hang gestures pupil size etc all give it away though i wouldnt be able to tell you exactly what to look for hit on enough girls with confidence and you just naturally catch on to the patterns that people present before you even make an advance
  getting /fit/ in general gets you treated better bro your confidence skyrocketed without being cocky your health and eating is overall wayyyyy better and you are motivated to do things
  damn shoulda hit on someone but there were so many people in groups i barely saw anyone alone besides since i live around here i dont have a hotel room
  they wont but im done indulging your rping
  of course people are naive if they believe that you arent treated differently for being more attractive there are numerous psychological studies that literally prove that the more attractive you are as a person the more likely you are to receive favorable treatment and even positive reaction to the same actions performed by unattractive people those who look good can get away with more than those who dont    from my experience even if i incorrectly go for a girl who isnt interested back or who is taken its a simple sorry i appreciate it though kind of response where i can easily just back off with zero repercussion instead of eeeek wtf siccko get out of my face perv and at the same time ive seen guys that i try to give advice who arent that good looking to be honest completely get their emotions crushed when they try being smooth and get that kind of negative response
  i think that just goes to show how pervasive fake kindness is in our society if youre only treating people positively because you consciously or subconsciously want to get into their pants then youre doing it for ulterior motives and not because some courtesy is inherently deserved by human beings but we all probably knew this already
  a lot of people judge on first impressions and that will never change
  unless youre byndo gehk heard she put out regularly behind her exes back
  i must look better than i think then people treat me pretty damn well even when i leak autism  start new job  3 people already talking to me initiated by them  i really need to hit on a girl already
  anything that doesnt jive with my world views is an rp    sure jan     attractive people are more likely to get jobs      people who are attractive are immediately upon first impression bestowed with the assertion of being trustworthy kind nice honest smart etc and because of this are less likely to be confrontational with you        welcome to look at the full book to read up more on this phenomenon the tldr is that if youre attractive even if you do something most would be against theyll at the very least let you off with a soft warning more often than not while if you were unattractive theyre more likely to pursue legal action against you the whole cosplay is not consent comes from people being pursued by those they find ugly theyre fine with their revealing cosplay attracting chad theyre not fine with it attracting todd even if theyre taken in a relationship they still at the very least appreciate on an emotionally gratifying level that chad tried to go after them
  you probably arework on your confidence because attractiveness is about more than just looks you can be a banger 9/10 but if you have poor posture always look scared have body language that shows youre not open for connection to others itll put a damper on your chances if people take a liking to you easily and you have bad luck with women it just means you need to work on your personality a bit     i know im coming off as an arrogant snob in these posts but thats more because i understand my stance and have confidence in being correct on it for reference this is the kind of thing most people look at and go oh what a bad boy why do girls go for the bad boys when theres a difference between being bad and just being bold and confident so dont try to emulate me and become a badass for your personality adjustment just learn to respect yourself more and understand who you are getting a firm grasp of yourself is the solid foundation you should always start with    good luck anon i wont say grab em by the pussy but when you build up to the right level then you very much can do just that under the right context context being youll know when they want it before you even do it and if you arent at the level yet then dont even try going for something that bold
  i love you togafucking poster
  my personality is fine my trick is to treat people like weve already known each other for awhile seems to work decently i also gauge the kinda humor theyre into and tune my own to match the thing with girls is i dont know how to push the envelope so i end up just being a friend
  pls ignore togafaggot  pls
  sounds good thats exactly what you want to do and it seems like youre good at reading the air and adjusting your approach based on the other persons personality this is the key here there is no one size fits all master code to it you need to learn how to adjust appropriately and quickly id say with girls you just need to be riskier not harassment riskier just actually make your intentions clear if you want something more than friendship with them you will get shot down a lot before you really learn what the right approaches are but thats part of learning many people are too scared to try so never learn    its like you dont get good at street fighter without getting absolutely bodied for hours on end right and then you practice learn why your face got smashed into the ground and learn what to avoid next time same thing here
  ill stop posting i dont want a repeat of last thread please ignore me though i do want anon to learn game seems like he has potential
  yeah youre right im gonna be a little more risky from here on but another issue is meeting them where i work there are no girls in my department and hitting on customers sounds like a bad idea not in schooling either
the world belongs to the brave you dont get anywhere by constantly being put down by what ifs    i know that as otakon this year my first con gave me a huge confidence boost i got into nice conversations with girls and they all gave nice and warm smiles during and after taking their photos didnt go further than that because i would really rather get to know them better first    thanks lucoa cosplayer you were really cute
  no hitting on customers  nope finding girls will be a personal thing since it wont be fulfilling for your confidence to go to random bars if the kind of girls you want dont hang there though it can give experience to start
  sounds like youre bitter over being ugly and autistic
i really hope anons are right about the bowsette meme being dead i fear for my local con scene
  i wouldnt say its fully dead merch wise artist alley had a shit ton of bowsette prints and pins cosplay wise though there was a few of them but not as much as youd expect
  youre just salty i got a ton of complements if youre going to wear the ahegao merch you gotta go all the way people really dug the glasses
alright stop with the incel talk and start p o s t i n g t h o s e     fotos
  got you chief heres my friend going as eggman he went as jinbei on friday with his wife as big mom in the one piece meet up
  cute  he makes a greet eggman
  thank you he spent a lot of time on it and was nervous that it didnt come out right too also my friend went as a warrior bowser too he was brainiac at nycc and got shouted out by dc
36000 attendees
  and its going to get a lot bigger next year this year was huge because of word of mouth from last year the con itch from nycc and because cosplay is much much much more prominently featured here
this was my costume on saturday had a lot of fun
  i saw that eggman the mustache was goofy in a great way wish i got a pic
  you looked great i was really hyped to see you there
  got it saw this amazing gold phos on saturday         i really want to grab a ahegao jacket for a con at some point
    if you want to follow him his ig is deadassmario heres another one of my friends cosplaying too she switched up costumes like every 45 hours which was seriously impressive hisoka is my favorite character in hxh so when she surprised me with this i flipped the fuck out she surprised me as i was getting fully painted     i saw you all over the con and youre on a lot of websites and videos too you were outstanding     i saw this cosplayer too twas pretty chill and everything man the cosplays this year were so good
and my friend law who went as voltron he went as voltron last year too
i loved this piccolo        i saw this dude at nycc in 2016 as well at animenyc and im guessing your the cobra kai he was with both of your cosplays were sweet
  i remember you as the cow on sunday not sure if i have photos of your cosplay from friday and saturday youre the perfect image when it came to being about consumerism food wise
  sounds like wishful thinking beta    let me guess youre the same pedo anon who justified grooming underage congoers
  guys its confirmed this is pedo anon
this midnight cosplayer was something else
  also cause tons of people heard badges werent needed the unofficial number is much higher
    the cobra kai is actually one of my best friends along with the huge carnage from nycc they roll with i was the rob lucci that piccolo is so awesome i wanted a shot with you    yepppppp especially friday you could literally walk in and not get caught saturday they got more strict with it but not as much later that day sunday they were out in full force badge wise
  whats your workout routine      that piccolo is amazing im blown away by how many good cosplays there were
  whats your workout routine    probably the same one that makes him so tiny
  number 2 or 3 in america in year 2 jesus they are coming for ax hard and fast
  deadass everyone hated fussy old lady     also hot take anime nyc and this is from someone who has gone to 15 cons and 6 of the top 10 cons in the us by attendance anime matsuri/ab because ab and sakura are the same weekend lolol otoakuhon the qubeco one not otakon and the texas cons are my missing ones and anime nycs showrunning is well better than them all it is like ax wrt good musical guests but without the shitshow that is ax heat it has good photo spots decent travel and it just needs a few improvements but honestly if anime nyc can get a few more musical guests more idol anime stuff i will unironically drop ax and have ala as my full time socal convention and use those days off for expanded japan trip    also please do what ax does and have a photo area since this is going to expand you could put it in hall 3 and everyone would love it its the reason why i love ax as a photog
  i swim 5x a week and lift 3x a week using proper form mondays i do overhead press 3x12 then incline bench 3x12 then flat bench 3x12 followed by cable pulls with different variations i do hanging leg raises every single day along with side planks and oblique work every single day its really become routine with me and i finish my work outs in an hour back is tuesday with squats leg lunges then arms i follow mostly athlean x since hes in my opinion the best when it comes to work outs that deal with health and proper form rather than doing lifts for the sake of it contraction of the muscles is honestly key to get gains rather than counting reps it really just becomes routine that and i cook my own foods and dont eat junk like pizza ice cream etc i love cooking my own food and i cook a lot of different dishes like italian asian french and spanish dishes i brought over so much food for the cosplayers because i know everyone gets hungry
  also agreed about the cosplayers there was seriously a lot of cosplayers that pulled their a game for this event there was also 2 amazing guts cosplayers and 2 alphonso cosplayers who are both my friends there was shockingly some castlevania cosplayers too
  thank you for posting this im actually going to update everyone what the staff said about the improvements since they really want this to grow for everyone the staff here are honestly pretty chill and were just not prepared for how many people would show up and didnt expect word of mouth to be so good for last year yeah we also talked about making the photo area much much bigger too and we plan on bringing more musical guests the goal is to bring the one piece singer as well as the whole bnha voice actors over next year so far and if anyone has any suggestions for guests please please let me know
  anyone has any suggestions for guests please please let me know  araki
  cool you make working out sound like its nothing too complex ill take a look at athlean x thank you
  noted thank you for the suggestion     it really isnt part of the process is just contracting the muscles rather than doing reps so a set of 8 with perfect contraction will always outperform a set of 1525 as well as raise your muscles and vascularity much easier really all you need to do is the basic overhead press bench with either dumbbells or barbells squats and then barbel rows 23x a week and youre all good i personally just have fun working out which is why i do it 3x a week as well as swim and train people you can even do this at home without going to the gym if you ever need advice im always available on ig never ever pay for a personal trainer at most local gyms most of the time they want to fuck over your progress by giving you work outs designed to make you think youre making progress but thats never the case
  the con falls at the exact perfect time too everyones itching for another big con after nycc even those who couldnt attend nycc and tickets never sell out quick even when they do you can go to image anime and get tickets there plus the word of mouth and the central focus being anime and cosplay and its growing massively due to this im happy its growing attendance wise
  its so easy now to just buy a quality costume i used to handmake bought a uwowo costume because of the pattern of the kimono top i didnt have time to hand paint sew exc with minor adjustments to sizing it was pretty darn good im so busy now its very tempting to just buy all my cosplay now its a different world now used to only have hand made then handmade and bad china costumes and some good japan brands now china has caught up and some brands are very decent
oh heres a shot of that amaterasu dog
  i personally strongly prefer handmade even if its slightly off versus a good bought costume    half the time its some instagram hungry person trying to get famous for minimal effort if you dont make your costume youre just a glorified model i also really believe theres no love for the character if you just buy it i know of so many people that just want to cosplay the latest meme thing with 0 effort like bnha or zero two or bowsette etc    i mean if youre entrylevel i get buying a naruto cosplay because you fuckin love the character or the series or if youre a halfnormie and not really in the cosplaying scene even so im seeing way too many people that have been cosplaying for months or years advertise themselves as cosplayers even give out business cards and didnt even try to put in any effort its terrible commercialization and only attracts half asseds and patreon thots wheres the talent and nerd dedication gone
  im going to disagree handmaking a character doesnt mean you looove the character theres plenty of cosplayers that handmake whatever flavor of the month character its cosplay nor cosmake costumeplay doesnt matter whether you make it or buy it love comes from the enjoyment of wearing the costume
  i always thought making the costume was the most fun part of cosplaying admittedly i end up spending more than it would cost to buy a cosplay but it usually ends up fitting nicer than a bought cosplay and you can pick nicer materials for a betterlooking cosplay and its a good way to pick up skills like millinery and tailoring
  i agree the satisfaction when youre done is super nice and its a good way to pass the time      i guess another aspect is that i like comparing techniques and marveling at other peoples work with bought shit its mostly oh you got it from that seller on aliexpress    i guess i just like the craftsmanship aspect of it i like seeing the tiny imperfections in other peoples costumes it feels a lot more organic kind of like how bake sales used to be homemade cookies and then they switched to just selling oreos from the bag if it makes sense it feels more homely even if someone handmakes a flavor of the month character i appreciate the effort done
  eh i think it depends   i make most of my costumes and its a big part of cosplay for me but ill buy simple stuff school uniforms mostly that it would cost more in materials to make and are simple enough that i really dont care but these are the exception rather than the rule   i do think that there are people who by costumes who really love the characters and arent just trying to jump on the flavor of the month but a lot of them commission handmade instead of buying from china so it is handmade
    while i understand your points about handmade and prefer it myself echoing other points made buying does not determine whether someone loves a character or not thats like saying only the people who made that anime/comic/video game character truly love that character because they went through the process of making said character from scratch or using your cookie example only people who make cookies truly love cookies    some people like myself do know how to sew and prefer to sew our own stuff but lack the time motivation and/or skill to sew full cosplays of characters we love thus we buy or commission and modify stuff instead we still wear a character we love and know about so rather than talk about our cosplay itself we just talk about the series and character with the hopes of someday making at least some of our costumes again when were less busy more motivated etc    tldr you can love a character you cosplay without handmaking your costume
  i think making your cosplay shows your love and dedication towards cosplay not to a character
  theres something aesthetic about looking at that outfit on display its like the combination being well done and recognizing the character invokes some feelings within me
  exact perfect time too  ehhh id prefer if it were during some warmer months more people would cosplay
i wanna cosplay disgaeas male ninja next year but i dunno where to start with these clothing pieces
  honestly they could do it in fall and in summer and i bet it would be big both times desu if it was around june it would be primo college students/high schoolers are free then so attendance would be a lot higher its also when a lot of people go on vacation so good time to take vacation days
  i wish it were in a wamr month or even a little earlier i dont work retail but a good amount of friends had to skip since they were not able to take time off a lot of retail places start blackout in november now apprently
      the reason they dont do it in the summer is because the building charges more based on seasons
one thing that was weird was what happened at the con saturday night i was waiting with some friends just walking around the con because one person from our group was in the masquerade the masquerade went on way longer than expected apparently none of the security knew that and were yelling at people to leave the javitz center despite noise and lights still coming from the masquerade room they kept saying that the last event ended at 1030pm but you could here the announcer throughout the whole con because of how empty everywhere else was
  the security is filled with miserable out of element fucks who dont understand a damn thing around them i kind of despise that
  i actually prefer the colder months less sweaty weebs even though it was freezing outside it still got pretty warm inside there was even ac on
  nah look at javits schedule they have events booked over a year in advance its more what weekends javits has free and the con picks from the given dates
  i smelled more in bo in the half day i attended than some cons ive been to before
  all those carts on the outside selling lies about the temperature  which reminded me of how fucking stupid the ending of sunday was 5 something carts all mashed together fucking idiots
we should honestly just make a discord for anyc and just nyc cons so us sweaty weebs can plan cosplays way ahead
  theres a few discords already existing for anyc and other nyc cons usually connected to facebook groups problem with those tho is that you out yourself as anonymous
  issue with facebook though is that like my account for example uses my real name not my cosplay name i feel like there should just be a discord that people can choose to stay on their screenames
  so an update for you peoples since i got a call back from the owner after he called to wish me a happy thanksgiving so the arcade expansion is a go it was really well received and he plans on expanding a room for it actually just like expanding the entire show floor space in general more japanese guests will most certainly be worked on we are planning on getting the bnha one piece naturo and other voice actors flown out as well as creators of anime series as well and we plan on making free autographs better because the lady who was handing out those tickets fucked over a lot of people better security has to be dealt with the javits center unfortunately thats not distributed by animenyc staff so on behalf of that part i truly apologize for whatever you guys went through security wise official meet ups are confirmed to be much much better and have more variety even the owner and staff were shocked a lot of big names animes didnt have stuff like dbz and naruto around and we plan on getting better volunteers for the animenyc insta for sure speed dating is a no go but if people are interested in the maid cafe idea that could work he said
  i would also suggest a central bag and badge check area when you first walk in because needing to go through a bag check before entering each area caused a bit of congestion and seemed redundant after doing it 4 times in a day
    seconding this having a central bag/badge check would be loads better as fast as bag and badge checks were it was annoying to have to do it several times a day just going from one area to the next
  maid cafe pls plspls ill be a maid so fast
    funny enough this was going to happen this year until 2 of the main staff said that people wouldnt mind the baggage check the same place as last year as long as it was faster ive been pushing them to just do baggage check right at the front of the entrance since last year     noted the real question is where would it be located any suggestions are definitely more than welcomed
i would prefer a better curated show floor rather than a bigger one dont let exhibitors sell shit with stolen art
  i dont know what the layout will be for anyc next year i go to nycc everyyear so im familiar with the javits although that top seating area is nice the one that leads to artist alley it would be congested with people trying to get through unless theres some way other way to get through the reason i would think this is a good spot despite the clear drawback is that its kind of sectioned out from the con the only issue is that since it has an escalator leading up food would have to be well stocked to prevent congestion later in the con since i dont think blocking the escalators to carry up food is a good idea especially when it may run out
  call them out on twitter
      also you could technically put the maid cafe in the corner of artist alley where the entrance is near the bag checks the corner is basically like a room if i remember correctly there werent any art stalls around there but a foodstall was
  people that buy ahegao shirts and shitty wallscrolls are the type that dont care where the art comes from anon
  neat thanks    i figured the speeddating would be a bit weird desu so im not really surprised    the key thing i think is to promote more cosplayers since thats a big attraction of cons at least for me having more photoshoots and more anyc photogs walking around would be a really key and beneficial thing hell we have a couple of resident photogs that i think wouldnt mind doing it and there are plenty of people with decent gear just shooting on the floor for free or exposure that anyc could work with unlimitedcrossroads comes to mind    just really happy about more meetups and more and better guests desu this year was a stepup from last but there are still some kinks to be worked out
  maid cafe good idea  bring araki and zun kudasai
  i meant report the booth/seller
  gib zun  ill legit sakuya in that case
  please dont use the kawaii societys maids for the cafe
  nayrt but they should just use cosplayer volunteers those contocon maids are kinda cringe
  the seagull squad rolls out  nearly everyone in full ita attire someone decided to bring a gun with them somehow complete with holster  one person is dressed in nice burando but is mushed behind several fats  resident brolita decides to show up as well wearing an unironed madoka and cheap aviators  an ita sits on a table and breaks one of the legs  someone else rubs their hands deviously and sees some beta staring at them  another one distributes business cards to their instagram to every patron    honestly agree though    honestly i think they could do a host club as a counterpart but screening would be kind of difficult id volunteer for the meme desu
  can i be the one rubbing my hands together    but yeah i think a host club would be nice but then you need to worry about fujo fakebois
mfw now hype for a con that is a year away
    last thing i care about is meeting a cosfamous cosplayer dont really care about them having a booth and that type of shit just breeds the mentality of elitism already in the scene if you mean cosplayers doing panels and presentations for topics they know thats a different thing but the last thing i want to see is just cosplayers showing up as guests and sitting at a booth
  i agree in that i dont care about cosfamous cosplayers i just care about good cosplay i want there to be more photogs paid by anyc to take photos of all the cosplayers there i see it as benefitting the ones that cant afford/dont think they need one more than the big cosplayers and that includes having more photoshoot meetups again with anyc sponsored photographers    i want to promote more people cosplaying and more people making cosplays i legitimately think having more people do it would be great for the con they could even do more offseason events like partner with joanns or something for sewing events could be cool
  maid cafe is getting a no from me it always seems like more people want to be a maid than want to be a customer plus i dont know if its worth your trouble going through the javits and their strict rules about selling food due to having their own food vendors and catering service
  speed dating is a no go    bummer but thats fine though is there any way there can be a general ice breaker panel or room kind of thing to meet and talk to other people at the con     also its really great that the arcade is getting expanded
  i mean youre not selling food youre selling a service wink
  if they dont want it done in the hall we can find a venue and do it somewhere else just like the anisong was done at the hammerstein having all parts of the con in one place is nice but we already dont have that so putting some parts in other places around the city wouldnt be the worst of things
crap i thought i already retouched that i need to get these pics off my phone and onto my computer so i can curate them properly
  what programs do you use for retouching photos
  you look like a fucking loser
  i dont really think theres any reason to retouch the photos when the pictures themselves are just hallshot snapshits   just dump em m8
  not him but i never want to post my stuff until ive touched it up  and then i never post it because the threads are 404d before i get it done  so im just gonna post a few straight tonight hope people like

prostigulls after last thread  im none of the people youve replied to but im curious how well does it pay are you in a country that its legal is it taxed like regular income whats your plan for when your looks arent good enough do you think its negatively impacted your view of men do you still have romantic relationships with men why did you go into it what got you into /cgl/  aware you have no motivation to answer these but for whatever reason a prostigull really piqued my curiosity  also its not because im a horny bastard its just surprising especially now i see theres at least 5 assuming we dont have larpers
  strong sense of personal justice   but a big enough heart to forgive those who go against it   high enough income at least matching mine to sustain frivolous purchases without worrying   clean handsome face   can respect my boundaries and my values   flexible willing to try out new things   okay with me only expressing my affections in private     but that kind of person doesnt exist let alone be attracted to me so ive resigned myself to living alone with 20 dogs though
tfw no prostitute gull gf  fuck this shitty ass life up
  yolo    seriously though life is too short and fragile not to live out your dreams
  can respect my boundaries and my values   thats totally relative depending on them what would you call your worst values
  id fit this but i fucking love pdas /
  tfw written several novels and cant seem to get published  what really puts salt in the wound is seeing the kind of trash that does luckily i have a degree in boring useful shit so i can still keep a day job to pay the rent
fuck yeah going straight towards student loans
  this is the second time ive ever seen my meme being used and its feels good knowing others have it and use it still    you could be an editor for people even if you did it as side work for college kids it makes good money and helps you improve your writing style imo i found when i took time to edit others i drew inspiration for my own writing and helps me get a feel for the kind of material more mainstream normies prefer to read which could at least give you a foot in the door but whatever you do dont stop writing and know youre worth more than the denials i believe in you
  hacking the post and posting my ideal gf instead    someone who gives me a lot of space to help and be competent with her i like taking care of others  dont be despise insult or hit me as a joke tsundere girls are the worst  no sjw shit  can take my soft bsdm kinky  huge weeb  its fine with physical contact all time
   i am actually more on the sugaring side of sex work i believe its legal since its a consensual relationship and i find it much easier to dismiss tax wise because the payments i receive are in forms of items or gift payments i started it because while i made the bare minimum in my life and even if i was barely eating due to lack of money i enjoyed having nice clothing and cute items all over my apartment because it made me feel good about myself then i started enjoying the attention feeling spoiled and feeling like i had actual money for once and if i ever wanted real cash selling items was never that big of a hassle i usually keep my arrangements longer term and with men who want an ongoing arrangement i actually got into lolita near the end of my sw career i received some of my beginning items from my last daddy gross but its the best way to describe it but when sesta/fosta passed and many of the forums where i offered services including used panties and the regular nude photos were nyxed and it scared me a lot so i quit entirely and invested much of my time into lolita instead
  kind understanding patient supportive  good sense of humor  passionate expressive unafraid of emotions  smart educated open minded loves to read  hygienic healthy fashionable sharp dressed at all times  enjoys nap dates cuddling holding hands   into cheesy but cute oldfashioned romance  bonus points if goth
   points if goth  will mildly edgy mostly black or dark blue clothing and long as fuck hair suffice
  chunky loudmouth tumblr fakeboi  super aggressive and argumentative with other people but always willing to talk out our disagreements  never flakes tells me immediately if he cant fulfill a promise/obligation and makes it up to me later  couples cosplays  blunt as fuck doesnt play games even if he knows itll hurt my feelings
  possibly but it would be nice to share at least vaguely similar tastes in music too not just fashion  define long as fuck hair how long is it exactly
  you need to take at least half of these to find someone close to that irl
  its all the way down my back at this point basically to my belt  as for music im mostly into electronicrock/industrial stuff but ill listen to pretty much anything around that area
  im painfully aware of that actually its a nice dream but i know that realistically my wardrobe is the best and only spouse ill ever have
  so to my understanding other than your tastes in music you say that youre everything i listed right
  mostly i dont dress great but id like to improve that anyway
  he could only afford one vivian
  my ideal partner    honest i dont give a shit what you think i want to hear or if youre afraid of how i might react i want the truth we can and will talk any problems out but i need to know about them to do so  monogamous youre the only person for me and i expect the same from you sharing intimate photos or videos maybe but only after talking about each specific instance and both of us agreeing to it  comfortable with pdas i love being physically affectionate and if you dislike that we probably wouldnt work out its ok if you dont like giving pdas though just as long as youre fine receiving    im honestly pretty easy to please as long as you can do those im good
  intelligent  loyal  will never cheat  respectful  doesnt watch porn  will never lie to me  into stem  introverted  trustworthy  genuine  doesnt drink or do drugs  enjoys discussion  caring  loving  thinker not a feeler but empathizes with me
  same im a hopeless romantic but the person i thought id marry kind of fucked me over so i gave up on hoping  its all just a lovely daydream     lolita has outlasted it all and will continue to do so
if one of you thotties is in nashville can you pick up a wig from my parents house and drive it to me in texas thank you
  lots of money hes willing to spend on me is okay with only seeing me once a week or less is okay with me living in my own house is not a killer rapist or mad with jealousy dies soon and lets me inherit all his money
i hope everyone has a great day
  damn 12/13 almost
  comfortable with pdas i love being physically affectionate and if you dislike that we probably wouldnt work out its ok if you dont like giving pdas though just as long as youre fine receiving  i didnt know i wanted this
  respects my boundaries/values   but willing to push his own  no
  hijacking and posting ideal gf    mixture of motherly and childlike  emotionally comforting  give and receive lots of physical affection  pastel coloured hair or white/silver  fighty in sex  insatiable sex drive  the smaller the titties the better  not an sjw  honest but not brutal  considerate and caring  very understanding  willing to take me on a planned date every now and then rather than having me the guy always do it  dont have to be smart or intelligent but open minded  can teach me new and interesting things  hates children as much as i do    i just want a partner who will treat me the same as i treat them
  you cant have it all anon you need to take the good with the bad
  my boyfriend is most of these but he does drink feels and thinks spoils me with lolita
  ideal
  hijacking for idea gf  no sjw nonsense  has a real job  enjoys physical contact  willing to give/receive headpats and lap pillows  doesnt steal all my money  able to cook  bonus points for tall and/or big tits
  stop what anon
    this is some lowball shit im all that except for tall/big tits but i have a bf already sorry      were you happy in your previous relationships
  ill describe my boyfriend who is ideal to me  wont allow me to help him clean up at his place whenever we eat i use his dishes im his guest  bought me a towel to use at his place but he likes using it to smell me  lots of kissing cuddling playing around in the mornings sometimes hell play pretend to eat my hair like a pony its really cute  spoils me with lolita food other stuff  is an engineer and thinks of me at work has sent me messages when he has  took me to my first meets in my new comm as a sign of support  doesnt watch porn or masturbate but amazing at sex and making me feel wonderful   can be a bit smelly in the mornings but hes slender and built and smells nice 90 of the time  most of our conversations are inside jokes metaphysics lolita fashion bitcoin and our love for each other     its gotten better with years and we certainly match a lot more now than ever it went from pure sensual sexual attraction to straight up cuddly romance and stability he never does much to anger/annoy me and weve only argued once in the four years we work as a unit to resolve issues talk about our feelings and express ourselves with no fear of repercussion
  if you cant take criticism you have no place giving it you need to be hungry for criticism as a writer your writing is an extension of you but you didnt pop out of the pussy writing like fucking poe embrace your messy drafts embrace the criticism its all going to help you give you a polished product that you can be proud of
  this is some lowball shit  my standards have tanked in recent years my minimum requirements are down to  be alive  be biologically female  dont be a complete hambeast  i cant even manage that though because i cant talk to a girl long enough to ask her out so none of this really matters
okay guys can someone just go ahead and make another friend finder thread
  i was actually already describing a girl i know but the chances of us being together are next to nothing she has her flaws but i accept them as part of her    but in any case its a wish list      im unsure i was comfortable in the relationship and happy about having someone to show affection to but that was it in retrospect to me she was just an object i could show affection to and to her i was just an object she could receive affection from
  im 24 and i feel this the cool ones are all babbies and the old ones are all fucking idiots i would never associate with outside of a convention or sober
damn this is going to be hard to be vague because this mf literally has enemies across north america maybe even internationally     this bitch always tries to ruin cons for me and everyone else they can get their toxic little hands on because i have bpd i cant be alone and they bring 20 costumes and have to be in a group and match for all of them and end up only wearing 1 or 2 because im so ugleeeee111 and will cry and throw a fit and 9/10 times will pack up all their shit and send everyone including me a picture of it and a long thing saying im going home this was a mistake this is my last convention i need to get out of this community posts to social media then 2 hours later deletes everything and is all happy and bubbily and telling people about haha this happened about whatever bullshit got them to want to leave in the first place haha i hate my roommates haha no one knows who im cosplaying haha im so ugleeeeeeeeeee    it used to really get to me because i also have mental health problems and feel bad but now i just fucking ignore that shit bitch i have worked so hard for years to get over my illnesses but youre not doing anything do not associate with me when youre a grown ass adult acting like a baby if i have to hear one more fucking time about how a 17 year old upset you im going to have an aneurysm
  that point was mostly because i dont want someone overbearing i want someone who can agree to disagree per say my political alignment sits kind of in the middle of the currently polarized spectrum so it would be emotionally cumbersome if someone keeps trying to change my mind if i were to guess worst for rightwingers would be that i value all the snowflakey gender identities and believe that america still has a rape culture problem and worst for leftwingers would be that i dont think liking fictional loli/shota is something to be crucified over and that one cant be ftx/mtx without experiencing dysphoria       sorry pda makes me cringe big time i guess i would be touched if my so did something romantic in public but also extremely embarressed i wouldnt be able to reciprocate i know some people value being loveydovey everywhere but i can barely say the l word to close family members on special occassions so forget about me saying it regularly in public       the general idea is wanting someone whos a good person but who doesnt force that standard on other people its not about him having to forgive me for trampling on his bounderies/values that respecting thing it goes both ways and by respecting i just mean having emotional awareness and not trying to forcefully convert the other person to your own set of values just dont force me into things like i can be coaxed but not coerced
  anon with bpd here she doesnt sound like shes bpd she sounds histrionic bpd has just become the trendy disorder after being anxious and depressed became normalised since it excuses being a fucking cunt    im bpd with avoidant traits i get very very attached to people especially my romantic partner and if i feel even in the slightest that they are distancing from me i will either go full psycho obsessive usually the case with romantic partners or cut them out completely and never forgive them usually the case with friends almost all my past and current relationships are built on manipulation and small lies which snowball because of this i try to avoid making relationships and keep everyone away from me because i hate the way i treat people i know exactly what im doing but i cannot stop myself    but she doesnt sound bpd shes sounds just like an immature attention whore which is most likely the case she just needs a good dose of reality which will straighten her out
  this    just sounds like any other cosplaying bitch that whores herself out on social media
  oh damn me
  a real life version of a 1980s tough guy fighter pilot with a penchant for the classics who likes good music
new cosplay acquaintance starts a photography site  he asks how it looks  notice he doesnt have anyone of varying skin tone in his example photos  ever so gently tell him that he might want to expand his lookbook so that people know he can properly light up skin that doesnt look like him like a good photographer    he thinks im calling him racist  jesus fuck white some people are such babies the second you point out they arent perfect bastions of sjwness    i expect him and his girl will say something racist eventually and have to explain themselves to people far less kind that me
i was fine for four and a half years being single now im suddenly not i hate it     woman with no cute tomboyish girlfriend to cosplay and game with      hijacking for ideal gf because related to my shit and i want to get it out     taller than me not hard considering im short as fuck at 5 exactly   tomboy with a girly side none of that gender special stuff she is content being a girl that doesnt 100 fall into gender norms like me   not a sjw or altrighter more of a centrist   pretty chill and laid back overall hardly gives any fucks   has an interest in working out and keeping fit so we can workout together   loves animals especially cats and/or rabbits   likes cuddles and kisses but is okay with me being weird about pda    sigh
  i cringed
  literally lancelot from gbf  my husbando is so cute
  the game plays as a roleplaying video game with turnbased battles  why am i just learning of this now
  not a sjw or altrighter more of a centrist
  the only people who use the term altright seriously are sjws
  thats true but i was just more reacting to the fact that hes an idiot for viewing the world in such retarded extremes and deserves to be alone
  which of the posters here are you
im traveling to a con by myself never done anything like that before    you guys got tips to ensure i dont end up alone the whole weekend im not terribly good at meeting people
  be optimistic
  be autistic
  here  have a choco anon
  morning im the gull from the last thread      pay is super variable depends how busy it is most of my jobs are 30 minutes and i make 40 for that although i sometimes do outcalls where i keep all the money and for that i charge 120150ph depending on travel time this year ive generally averaged between 700 and 1200 a week     actually selling and buying is completely legal here uk i declare my income like anyone else although i use a euphemism for what i do because i dont want my actual job written down on paper anywhere i have a degree so i pay a tax rate of about 25 we have whats called third party criminalisation where the job is legal but lots of related things like having a driver or working in the same flat as someone else is illegal     there is literally no such thing as not looking good enough there are some really successful working girls i know that you couldnt give away its all about how much effort you put in i dont have a plan for afterwards but im thinking about doing an ma next year and then maybe getting into translation or fucking off to do tefl in some random country i dont really do longterm goals i dont think theres much point with all the political and economic instability at the moment     im not sure i guess i now think men are really dumb when i didnt have much of an opinion on them before i appreciate the nonidiots a lot more though
   i have a boyfriend he knows what i do its a nonissue      i was skint i needed money that day i found out i hate working in my degree field and my anxiety made it hard to find/hold on to a 9  5 i stayed because i like the freedom flexibility earning potential seriously for what i do its probably easier than working in mcdonalds but i start at 70ph and frankly i cant see any reason not to do it i do take breaks though i go a bit loopy after a while especially when ive been working solidly and i havent heard my real name for a week or so     been on /cgl/ since i was redacted like a really long time was super into lolita a while back and have some good mates from it but havent worn it recently honestly ive been away from here for years but i was kind of curious about the sfe drama     im not gonna answer any followup questions partly because im supposed to be studying but also because its totally off topic
  ideal gf  loyalty above all else which ill always promise to return  is open to the concept of affection and a lot of physical contact  healthy interest in sex and open to exploring/trying new things and isnt content with missionary once a week  recreational druguse isnt a perquisite but id rather someone who isnt a completely insufferable straightedgefag would at least consume alcohol with me  darker sense of humour whod indulge me with mine and isnt offended easily  knows how to strike a fine balance between not taking life too seriously but being serious about what they want and what their convictions are  is willing to argue with me/bring something up like an adult when i do or say something she doesnt agree with and doesnt simply walk away or hangup the phone during a difficult conversation that isnt going her way i need communication and i absolutely hate being made guess what someone else is thinking  isnt overly jealous or insecure if another guy/girl openly expresses interest in you while im around and theyre not being a creep about it/know to stop im secure enough in myself to know nothing would come of it and take it as a compliment i usually expect the same of my partner  doesnt have to have taste in music/movies/videogames/weeb identical to my own because i adore sharing the things i love with someone new and exploring their tastes as something new myself  is fine with the concept of space and not doing absolutely everything together all the time  if lolita gothic/classic a huge plus  doesnt have to fit a specific type appearancewise because ive dated women of all shapes and sizes just dont be obese
  i have a boyfriend he knows what i do its a nonissue  i like to think of myself as pretty accepting but i dont think i could be down with knowing my girlfriends probably had more cocks inside her at work that day than ive had bathroom breaks at the office
  meh id be ok w/ it
  read this absentmindedly  instantly thought chocobo  open image  it has nothing to do with final fantasy    and this is why i try to keep myself from getting my hopes up now im sad
  none of them i just replied to that post alone
  misfire im none of the posters just that post alone
  me  the communication thing is a big thing for me all my exes are the silent non confrontational type
  where you at tho anon and communication is one of the most important things you can have theres nothing worse than never speaking up and people holding grudges/building up resentment over shit you never even knew was bothering them in the first place
  probably not where you are europe
  im europe too
  what are they about anon why do you think they dont get picked up
  glad youre not my bf honestly
  feelings mutual
  can pass for a normie out in the street  why are you here
  crossboarding straight dude
  hell never be real  ill never get to lick his thighs  kill me
you girls are crazy
  sounds like you want a stacy and boy oh boy are none of us stacies
  wants to be treated and pampered like a princess but doesnt expect or demand it  doesnt expect or demand it  not a stacey
  im one of the former sex workers who responded i did sex work from when i was 22 to 27    how well does it pay  incredibly well i started off charging per hour and i didnt make much at the beginning eventually you build up your client base and thats when you make a lot with repeat clients i wasnt so specific about time limits it was just until we were finished i way preferred to have about a dozen or so consistent clients and i got to a point that in order to take on new clients they either had to be referred to me through an existing or exclient i liked or from a fellow sex worker    are you in a country that its legal is it taxed like regular income  im in canada and the laws here around it are a bit weird i was technically never doing anything illegal i did a little bit of camgirling too so it was easier if i just acted as if all of the money came from that and i did pay taxes on it all    whats your plan for when your looks arent good enough  as the other anon said looks are not nearly as important as you think attitude and enthusiasm are much more important and if you can find a niche that helps a lot    do you think its negatively impacted your view of men do you still have romantic relationships with men  my view of men has nothing to do with my sex work i still date men and i did when i was active as a sex worker too i told them before anything physical ever happened between us as i think everyone has the right to know if someone else is sleeping around and whether theyre comfortable with that most guys obviously werent but i had two long term relationships during when i did sex work
  why did you go into it  i was broke at the time and i had to start paying back student loans so i suddenly had even more bills each month i was working two part time jobs at the time as it was impossible to find anything full time that paid decently between the two jobs i didnt have any time to see my friends or family and my life was shit i decided to try sex work as i had a friend who did it and she made a lot of money doing it i asked her about it and we had a long talk about whether itd be good for me and i decided to try it out i quit one of my part time jobs and did a couple of jobs with her and then picked up a few clients of my own and the rest is history    what got you into /cgl/  i like cosplay and i wear a few j fashions
  do you dont want to help at all in raising your own children
  wanting a woman with a perfect body  also want her to be your baby mill  disgusting
  im so in love with my current bf and i feel like he respects me as a person too and doesnt just use me to satisfy some needs i love how passionate and inspiring person he is i dont like aggressive males at all and while i value his softness a lot i also appreciate his masculinity a lot i have never felt this accepted and safe in my life and i finally feel i have someone who understands and shares my views of the world he also approves lolita and is genuinly intrested of it which feels nice  mfw him saying he is proud of me wearing lolita and looking good in it felt too good
  women with healthy habits bounce back from pregnancies just fine tho
  not all of them do
  this was all very reasonable until   boobs  now its just sexist
  yamato nadeshiko but white
  just get big boobs whats the problem
  id prefer to stay alone thankyou
  i mean these are ideals its not any more sexist than a gull saying handsome face
  shut the fuck up lol
just got my first brand piece i only had indie brands until now i love it its beautiful and fits perfectly the only downside is i got fucked by customs the shipping was more expensive than the item secondhand but hey you learn quickly ill eat soup for two weeks but it was worth it ill choose international mail next time
i dont believe in ideal gfs but just a nice and cute person i could carry around using this body would be a really nice experience    hugging smaller people feels really good
listen to otome cd  pretend some jap guy really is moaning licking and whispering in my ear  orgasm in 30 seconds  i love this
    he  deserves to be alone    anons come on it was 3 in the morning and i said i was a woman twice im surrounded by crazy people on both ends of the political spectrum wasnt sure how else to refer to them i dont view the world in retarded extremes or i wouldnt be looking for someone normal and not one of those crazies should i say im not looking for a person whose politics lean too far one way or the other jfc
   gentle soft and caring   cares for me and doesnt mind spoiling and being spoiled   open minded good companion likes to talk about everything   trustable   respects my hobbies and also has hobbies of his own   willing to play video/board games together and other hobbies   also willing to experiment different things in private   likes to listen as much as he likes to talk   interested in studying and learning new things   smells nice and likes to cuddle and have naps together     i dont really mind looks or money a hardworking person with a good heart makes up for all of that
  
  this is me minus the studying though i still do like to learn new things i always just found it extremely difficult to sit down and crack a book in school or study for tests i posted 
  you rubbing your prostate probably helped
  prostate  do you know where you are
  r9k but with cars  no thanks anon
  here is /r9k/ but with lolitas
  im  and i can guarantee all of these depending on what you mean by experiment
  /o/ crossboarder here we dont want her
  why not pseudo takumikun
  meanwhile /r9k/ with frills
  i read it fine i just didnt think it was worth correcting
all of the ideal bf/gf posts are pathetic desu except for the one describing her actual real bf
  sorry no one responded to yours
  its /soc/ tier but for some reason seems less vapid in here
after a full week of wearing jfash and doing christmassy things with my bf in his home state im back home to where my depression is hitting full force and im nonverbal    my selfimage has really deteriorated in the last few months or so too because a liz lisa skirt my bf bought me for our anniversary doesnt fit because i didnt look at the measurements and bought it on a whim since other liz lisa skirts fit me fine now i not only hate myself and my appearance but i cant verbalize that to anyone because ive just shut down mentally
  sending a hug to you if youd like one    please try not to get down about one article of clothing not fitting you even within one brand their sizing can fluctuate
  how does depression cause you to lose the ability to verbalise your thoughts ive never heard of this before
  nayrt  i get this you open your mouth and your brain just has nothing for you or tells you that its not worth it and your guilt falls on you like a lead blanket and you prefer to keep quiet    anon im thinking of you and wishing you the best its time for a warm shower or bath and you can say nice things to yourself or about others quietly while the shower is running to help mouth and brain get closer together
  fuckin do it buy all the dresses just no amazon/ ebay trash actual lolita dresses only    im so glad amazon wasnt big when i was younger and i was forced to wait for brand
tfw even guys who appreciate lolita either a hate sweet or b fetishize it  why is this i just want to feel cute
  im male think sweet is ok and dont fetishize it
  its all about sex with guys if they hate sweet they dont find you sexy and think you probably have a fetish for it if they have a fetish for it obviously theyre going to be interested in it but for reasons you dont like youre either going to have to find a guy that doesnt care about it at all or the super rare guy that only lives in your 3am rem sleep
  guys just like to mix things with sex because its fun and exciting missionary position once a week for the sole purpose of procreation gets boring real fast
  are you retarded
  if youre into retards yes
  sorry im smol and almost titless kek  im also into social justice although im far from being a warrior i like to study it and when possible work into making a world better for the unfortunate aka working with charity and helping with law counselling regarding familiar and financial matters
tfw no tall sweet as pie lolita gf with tastes similar to mine and a personality which complements my own
met a con friends fiance for the first time and shes super cute    now i have a big crush on her life is suffering
  or the super rare guy that only lives in your 3am rem sleep  i guess i dont exist and just live in peoples dreams  really attitudes like that is probably partly why so few men are into lolita/ouji/jfashion i cant say i like lolita without feeling like they think i just fetishize it and many lolita clubs/groups straight up ban men  what am i to do
  become a woman
  like i said tall and big tits are just a bonus also what youre doing is perfectly fine by sjw nonsense i mean bitching about things that are effectively nonissues and demonizing average people for being average  if anything id say what youre doing is commendable
  thanks anon youre cute too
what got deleted
  which country
  an anon replying to one of my posts saying youre cute anon  dont know if it was because of ot  if so i dont want to get deleted either    man i really love lolita
  ok thats fair i used shitty wording and terms in my original post my bad
  thread is near ded all the time  i misstype a spoiler  spam the delete button like no tomorrow  sudden everyone see it    goddamint
  its the colors the color palettes are just kinda ugly
  im so embarrassed for you
  no spoilers on cgl anonsan but i am feeling cute today
  tfw tall but mean
  a real human being saying he prefers big tits over itty bitties must have made fattymod mad enough to ban him
  its just for fun most anons who posted probably dont care if their future partner matches all of these traits
  becoming androgynous is a goal for me desu best of both worlds
  tfw will never have qt crossdressing bf who i can share dresses with
  nayrt but i can work with this
  like crossdressing and making my own outfits  but not qt
  im a guy and i just think its like pastel vomit and looks like shit its nothing to do with looking sexy which isnt the point of lolita at all anyway
  uk
  likes crossdressing  makes own outfits  not cute    yeah right
  hacking this  i want her to be really into something competitive like sports or professional music i want her to talk like all the time oh and when she is not talking i want her to be sharing all the stupid shit she can find on the internet or just her thoughts she should also accept that i can be overly caring at times and that its not because i like her but because its how i am as a person
  that sucks im sorry i did that with an aatp blouse and im so upset i dont know if itll ever fit me but i cant bring myself to get rid of it yet in some weird hope it does        this happens to me too might be because im also on the spectrum but its like it just hits so hard your brain cant work happens when i am overwhelmed too i hate that it pisses people off but i have a hard time overcoming it
  whoa thats me  except im not fat nor tumblr nor fake  shit
  kys
  this is me but im a girl  i swing both ways hbu
  is wanting to princess carry a girl wearing it fetishizing it
    older type of guy  i dont mind gray hair  into music  seems angry and sad but is actually warm  can kill me instantly  is an italian composer who died 200 years ago  is antonio salieri from fgo
  sounds like you just want a woman desu
  hes probably gay for his friend thou
  princess carry  elaborate is that like bridal style
  nayrt but yes
  nayrt but yes it is
  i really do need one at the moment thank you i didnt think itd get me down as much as it did but its my dream skirt and every time i tried it on i wanted to die      its hard to explain but some other anons have done it for me the way it is for me is that i just shut down and i feel like nothing i say has any meaning or benefit to anyone so i just stay silent      thank you so much i never expected people would actually respond to me and understand how i feel im so grateful to you and everyone else who answered when i get off work ill do just that thank you so much      im glad someone understands the feel im going to keep my skirt as i can still admire it in my closet as a gift from the man i love i might be on the spectrum too ive always thought i was since my mind has never worked like everyone elses i hate that it hurts people too but i really cant do anything about it
    patient inquisitive thinker intelligent   emotionally intuitive  doesnt find mentall illness exhausting but still calmly able to call me out on my behavior when my ptsd is making me act like a dumbass   understands family is important but still keeps them at arms length so that i have to minimally interact with them never had a family really so ive always gotten irritable when other peoples familys dictate who they date and why  responsible   doesnt fucking whine about things without trying to fix them first  hygenic not super fat   can give me a dicking so rough i see the whites of my eyes   not afraid to address emotions and cry
  dont go crushing my dreams anon
  im not sure if its possible or if it would ruin the skirt for you but have you considered having it altered so it would fit
  oh hey i fit on everyth  can give me a dicking so rough i see the whites of my eyes     nevermind
  i have considered it before the thing is theres only so much elastic at the back to where i dont think ill gain more than an inch theres also two clasps at the waist as well as a zipper which hurts a lot when i wear it i dont know much about alterations but im not sure if they could do much i would selfpost myself wearing it but i dont think thats allowed in feels threads so heres just a photo of it to get the idea
  i would selfpost myself wearing it but i dont think thats allowed in feels threads  bitch this thread itself isnt allowed by the rules
  im reporting every single one of them to the irs
  is the belt functional like can you undo it even if it doesnt come off at the way if so you might be able to hide an elasticated panel behind it so that might give you an extra couple of inches for the waistband and youd be able to cover it up just using the belt itself so it wouldnt ruin any design or anything
  
  yeah it completely comes off thats not a bad idea actually thats better than what i was told if it fits then its fine no need for alterations anyway ill see if i can take it somewhere in the future thank you
  youre welcome anon i hope you had your nice bath too
man i just love my tits    man i just want a lolita gf    man im glad im not a man but itd make getting the lolita gf thing easier but its also be harder to have tits as a man

  i did the same thing though i also dont cry easily
i was able to order another poodle print dress today and im so excited that im up to 3 main pieces two purses and an umbrella all poodle themed    god i just really fucking love poodles and lolita
  fair       i already have a bf sorry youre alone
  monogamous  as big of a pervert as i am  has depraved kinks  liberal but not an assblasted sjw  willing to dress in ouji or lolita once in a while for dates  respects me not wanting biological children  is okay with the possibility that i might want to adopt a child in my mid 30s to mid 40s  not a goddamn spic   or maybe a spic that is not all about la raza and is light skinned like me    i deal with my ultra mexican extended family who wont leave me and my whitewashed immediate family alone
  same honestly
  is south america fine to you
        whichever one of you is a qt lolita i dont mind your substyle or an actually xyzz tier /fit/ bro can have me and these glorious tits
  oh boy i lost   im so sad
  flipping dis  similar interests/hobbies with maybe some outliers  likes to banter doesnt get offended easily  still sensitive at the right times  about as /fit/ as me  about as good looking as me  motivates me while i motivate her  can hold her autism in public can pretend to be a normie if its needed  good communicator so shit gets resolved fast  loyal/monogamous  not politically interested or just slightly right  goofball sometimes  someone i can be an introvert around just sharing the same space without talking if im feeling gloomy    honestly a female version of me would be awesome i guess i view relationships to be your extra best friend like whats the point of being in a relationship if you dont have similar hobbies sounds dull af
shot for a gay cosplay boudoir calendar  calender was supposed to be for sale in late october  still no mention of it  photographer and project organizer have gone awol    i just want to know what happened to my photos
  implying    lolitas are all raging misandrist lesbians
  tfw no lolita gf that tells me i am worthless male  tfw no lolita gf that spits in my mouth  tfw no lolita gf that pegs me maybe  tfw no lolita gf that steps on me  tfw no lolita gf that sits on my face
  iktf  tfw 50k in debt and literally cannot make the monthly payments they want i literally am selling my pussy to make progress on these fucking loans thanks college thanks obama
gay boi who rides same bus as i and lives in my building  his phone lockscreen is two men holding hands and he has a wedding ring so i presume hes a married gay  i always sit next to him because he showers daily which is better than 90 of bus riders  first few rides he looked like he utterly despised me  all i do is study on my phone so idk why just assume gay men hate women and ignore it keep studying on phone  today he smiled at me on bus  i was thinking about something and didnt realize until afterwards  what did he mean by this spoileris it mmf time/spoiler i just dont want him to despise me or think im hitting on him by sitting next to him literally its just because hes a nothobo     just so you know i know what that means and im probably one of the 3 anons on the website including you who does
hashing out deets for next cosplay saber prototype  usually im super careful about being accurate to source material  absolutely hate his sword design think it looks terrible aesthetically especially the blade looks really stupid  really want to just use arturia sabers sword  sheath design even though it wont be the right one    this is tearing me apart gulls the inner autist in me wants to use the accurate design but i just really hate the way it looks
  shit that thing about adoption is a good one i shouldve thought of whenever the topic of kids comes up in relationships most people treat it like go biological or not at all but id prefer to adopt desu blood relations mean nothing to me and theres so many kids out there that could really use a loving family
  go for accuracy or any autist you meet is bound to give you a did you know thats not the right sword
  tfw no lolita gf to do those last two things with lots of love and affection and otherwise treats me like a regular human being
  why is masochism so common with male anons on this website  you see threads with tfw no femdom gf at every board but no a single maso gf  does maledom nerds only exist on fictional media
  i would be that autist desu but its just so ugly     i probably will go with the proper design just hating it internally
  masochistic degenerates are more likely to be vocal about it any kind of dom would most likely keep their tfw no qt sub feels silent
  and im probably one of the 3 anons on the website including you who does    lol no
  because maso gfs are a dime a dozen and every dom who could ever want one already has three
  any kind of dom would most likely keep their tfw no qt sub feels silent  its a common feel though to be fair
tfw nobody who will love you for the damaged weirdo actually you are give you space when you need it and actually likes your jokes    rib in peas
  pathetic
  nayrt but i know a guy who is a femdom sissy in sex ordinary guy otherwise pretty handsome goes to gym cali rocker sort of look does a bit too many drugs but youd never guess he says its because he got very sick of feeling like girls arent even there in sex that they are at best tolerating being fucked or a borderline nonparticipant so he wants to feel like the girl is actually there in body and mind so he makes them take the active role    i can empathise with him to a degree it does get exhausting being the dominant partner because the submissive partner doesnt have to really worry about anything they just do what theyre told take what is given and just enjoy the performance whereas the dom has to make sure the sub is enjoying themselves that she is excited having fun and is aroused whilst also keeping your own arousal and not going too far 510 of the time i just want the girl to flip the table on me and beat me until im just mess of bloody scratches and my skin is nothing but black and blue and squeeze me dry until im cumming blood    i would expect people are more vocal about it because its much harder to find a dominant girl rather than finding a masochist girl also femdom guys are usually autists who have this warped sense of attraction towards females since they are khvs they think since they find it attractive when a girl is submissive that a girl will find them attractive if theyre the submissive one instead that develops into full blown sissification
  share a joke
  fucking this  i had a friend for over 2 years and he passed as the most ordinary glasses boy you could meet  then one of my friends got to bed with him wearing a suit on a halloween party  sudden she came saying that he tied her hands with his belt blindfolded her with his necktie and went full kinky on the night  literally everyone got wtf went she told us
  aww i feel this dont give up hope though there is someone out there who will love you for the damaged weirdo you actually are all while wanting to see you grow and get stronger and better as a person simply because they love you and want to see you happy     also i giggled at that last bit so theres bound to be someone out there for you who will also sincerely like your jokes    best of wishes to you anon
tfw want somebody to love  tfw need somebody to love  tfw would love somebody to love  tfw cant find somebody to love
  you see threads with tfw no femdom gf at every board but no a single maso gf  because it is way more difficult to find a dom gf than a sub anyone who wants a maso gf already has one because they are so easy to find and have nothing to complain about
  i fit a good amount of these but im falling apart from my last relationship and too nervous to approach anyone until i get my shit together so im just going to hijack this to describe myself to help vent these feels  6 feet tall  heavy interest in japanese fashion would love to pick out clothes for a girlfriend shes welcome to dress me up in whatever mens clothes she likes as im certain im too tall for jfashion  well paying job so i can afford whatever dont like to spend it on myself but spend it on lavish dates and vacations  rich parents who own their own little farm  hobbies include crafting and playing piano cant stand sewing would love to design jewlery with a future girlfriend make it and have her model it id practice for hours on the piano trying to learn whatever song made her happy  love cheesy romantic bullshit dream of being able to act the part of a perfect prince for a princess as cheesy or cringe as that sounds
  female
  not into being degraded but sex is where my masculine pride fails me id rather have a woman take the lead for me
trying to buy some straps for my itabag see two i need from the same seller on both otamart and mercari  ask fromjapan first  first item is cancelled immediately they say they wont work with shopping services second gets refunded a day later after my hopes get up  try japonica maybe theyll be more subtle  japonica says the selling rules of this seller are difficult and complicatedsorry we are not able to accept the order so canceled    they have so many items in these huge all together item lots with individual prices on all of them holy hell dude take my weeb money why be so difficult if you have so much crap you need to sell
  use a personal ss
  sudden she came saying that he tied her hands with his belt blindfolded her with his necktie  is that kinky i may be more kinky than i thought
  well whats your idea of kinky
  your pictures are safely in the pocket of his fap folder congrats
  japonica normally skates by i really do think it is the seller they tried to explain one of the sellers responses to them and it doesnt translate well  i think the seller was insisting they buy at least three things and wanted them to buy one of the worthless items no one wants if they were only going to buy two things im done trying to deal with this seller the items will pop up agan someday
  its not so much my idea of kinky more my idea of normal and i had thought that was fairly normal
  tfw no switch girlfriend
  its a normal type of kinky but its still kinky its not like he pulled out the ball gag a noose an enema and a permanent marker to write shit on her
  go on
  gotta save something for next time
tfw no online friends that want to rp and i have to larp on here
  get away from me pervert      theres always more extremes i promise without getting too explicit a girl i knew had a sort of weird exhibitionist fetish not full on exhibitionist but she wanted people to know she had been abused    went to a friend of a friends house party i brought a bag full of fun we went to a bedroom she left the room covered in bruises rope burn hand prints on her neck the word fuck toy written on her cheek amongst other things all over her legs arms back etc her hair looked itd been through a wind tunnel tbh she looked like a fucking mess but she just strolled out got a drink and just started chatting with everyone like nothing happened but it got her off that obviously everyone knew exactly what had happened to her
   but it got her off that obviously everyone knew exactly what had happened to her    people who involve others in their kinks without consent are fucking gross
  how much you need bruv im up for helping someone with shitty spending habits for the holidays
  thats almost the definition of exhibitionism
all these anons wanting physical contact but cant do that myself  always joke about hugging and holding hands but actually extremely embarassed about it    not gonna make it anons    i just want a 7/10 softie husbando that loves dogs as much as i do and will cosplay with me and can make each other laugh is that too much to ask _
   joke about hugging and holding hands but actually extremely embarassed about it  cute
  nayrt but all i want to do is spend my money on dresses u can always buy me another to help me not keep spending all my  uwu
  the absolute state of this post spoileralso samespoiler im currently working on my first ever cos and its going to be kamen rider
  which one number 1
  nope ex aid but i do want to do more riders in the future because i am head over heels for the series
  7/10    lower your standards females are known to rate men very harshly on their appearance so a 7/10 is probably like maybe the top 5 of all men
  sorry buddy if i cant see some semblance of a sob story it just doesnt flip my switch  if you can make it seem like youre struggling and sad ill hook you up
  tfw will never have a qt bf to do this cosplay with
  tfw like riders  tfw like masked cosplay because im autistic about my face not fitting the characters  tfw i cant cosplay riders because im also autistic about general bodyshape and theres no 64 broad as hell riders that i know of    life would be so much easier if i was mentally capable of just not giving a shit
  bitch i would love to do fourze im excited now
  just cosplay showa riders they are all manly as hell
  tfw im dating at least 8 of yalls ideal boyfriends and one gf    its 3 different people though
  gentaros actor is like 61 which is part of the reason they made fourzes head pointy to add a bit of extra height because seiji takaiwa is about 4 inches shorter than him    anyway even without that nonsense you can be a tall rider if you want      ive done cosplays of some nonrider characters before but ive never taken the leap into making a full rider suit i just need someone to go on that journey with me
  i guess because i never considered myself overly attractive had anons here say i was 67/10 so 7/10 isnt /that/ good looking me just want somebody who looks pretty good in cosplays doesnt have to be above average handsome    all these anons loving masked charas and wanting to cosplay riders    ppls let me hold your hands in cosplay with helmets on   pic related wanting to cosplay for 2k19 and hold akibareds hand
  i think most people considered monogamous a given
what is this jap power rangers shit
  girls in general are just a lot prettier than guys because they put a lot more into their appearance a 7/10 female is probably like the top 3040 of all girls    girls tend to skew guys very negatively in terms of appearance where guys are very balanced in rating girls referencing that okcupid or pof infograph
  huh i wonder why they didnt do something similar for drive since shinnosukes actor is 61 too      or shit i just realised rider 1s power up form is supposed to be 219cm tall and 219kg heavy so theres that
tfw no horo to my lawrence or miria to my isaac
  i guess that makes sense i never really thought about it that way    end of the day dont care about appearance as long as wearing a helmet 80 of the time and has a healthy weight to look good in suit
  what anyone that references that infograph never seems to point out is that on okcupid rating someone a 1 or 2 hid their profile and rating them a 4 or 5 sent a notif to them so lots of women used that feature just to hide mens profiles they didnt want to see and very rarely would actually pick 4 or 5 because they didnt want most men contacting them which isnt necessarily about looks      drive does have that little spoiler on his head which helps bring his height up a bit and fourze could kind of get away with the cone shape because hes a weird space man anyway
  isaac and miria  not jacuzzi and nice
  okay but men would have done the same thing no
  yeah the spoiler just didnt hide it that much to me when i was watching there were numerous moments when i had a small chuckle at drive shrinking a few inches when he transforms
  a 7/10 female is probably like the top 3040 of all girls  pretty sure this is true by definition    would be interesting to see corresponding data for how girls/guys rate the same sex especially if female ratings still skew right
  no because men dont get unwanted attention from women on dating sites the same way that women get it from men      ill be honest and say im not a fan of drive so i dont even know if i paid enough attention to notice lol
  i am currently working on dangerous zombie from ex aid but for now i am going to do some base rider stuff like emu and hiiro with the game driver id love to take the leap with someone and do a couples cosplay of riders but i think im too tall       yeah dude fucking granddad is big as fuck and swole now you can easily do that id even help      i actually just finished drive i liked it alot desu it was a change from fourze with more adult oriented plot
jesus get a room you two
  not necessarily true by definition natural human attractiveness is probably more normal distribution than even amounts of each tier which would put 68 of women in the 47 range 135 each in 23 and 89 and only 21 each would be 1s or 10s
  tfw no discord for gullrider fans
  ill be your rider friend anon
  fair i just fucking loved drive because i am a big detective nerd whether private or police and kiriko was top cute      isnt organising a room for the convention one of the last things wed need to do i mean we havent even started work on the costumes yet
  kiriko was legit one of the most useful heroines in the series
  not too tall be a tall rider if you want be the one be the lights    im glad you enjoyed drive i like that they make shows aimed at different kinds of viewers even if some of them arent my cup of tea i liked shinnosuke and kiriko as characters a lot but i just couldnt get into the show
  there are at least three of us here jeez
  post discord so u can recc me your fav rider series and we can someday cosplay our fav rider together 
    we should add each all get together and watch some rider in a group chat   mach4628     this is so much fun
even though i participated this thread was a mistake
  not that anon but mine is baconheart0762  reccing riders will have to wait until tomorrow im about to pass out thanks to work
  if you have even intervals over the normal for sure guess it begs the question of what people believe 7/10 describes since i just assumed it described a percentile
      added both of you wow watching all together would be adorable and amazing  discord icon is drinking tea
    added you both as well
  in all of the years ive monitored the crossplay threads here no girl has tried to get in contact with anyone there its all guys stuck in the same layer of hell and the occasional girl asking how to hide her jugs for ftm  either all of the posters like you either arent serious about wanting to find someone dont want anyone from here or youre actually guys larping to make other crossplayers happy
i love the face that so many rider fans are here
been drinking a lot lately to numb feelings chronic pain and get through the last of my law finals  gain weight over holiday season  been on fast track to fitting every dream dress ever with diet and exercise  fit newest purchase but not exactly the way id like  anon have you gained weight  family member   drinks more to forget   remembers thats what got me here  mfw is pic related     im making a resolution before christmas to stop this functioning alcoholism gulls i will beat this pls wish me luck
  hope this doesnt sound too creepy but i think i know who you are and i wanted you to know that i admire you and wish that would notice me already senpai
a bunch of anime fans made contact near immediately and came off anon  as far as we know phkun and nurse still havent  i mean i get that the guy is worried over what he thinks might be romantic rejection but i figured at this point he would realize how into him she is  still waiting on that romance novel
  what are you talking about anon what lore is this
  im beginning to think they share a fanbase with hnk
  god i hope i find some cute kr fans that is my dream
   cheesy romantic bullshit dream of being able to act the part of a perfect prince for a princess as cheesy or cringe as that sounds  thats actually very sweet hope you can find someone who is good to you soon anon
  someone else answer this gull im going to bed
  its recent cgl lore  rooting for them
  well never hear about them again  this always happens
  we basically get a new ship every other thread
  a lifetime of social conditioning that builds up into someone who finds being mistreated to be the norm and wants to confirm with the person theyre most intimate with that they are scum of the earth they want to feel like their personal views of themselves are validated but despite being such a worthless piece of shit someone still wants them that even at their worst theres someone that craves using them like a napkin crumbling them up and tossing them into the trash when theyre done    its the same reason why most women are into being subs
    or its just two dudes engaging in roleplay as people tend to do this is more likely than anything else
  part of a perfect prince  piano  romantic  marry me right now
        that is 4 our of 116 posters just curious how did you transition into cgl for all the lewds in here the connection really isnt obvious
  unfortunately im not really here for a relationship just cosplay advice
  what a clit tease
  tfw masochist dom  tfw no sadist sub gf
  thats because men find most women to be attractivehence my point is still right
  i figured at this point he would realize how into him she is  hopefully hopefully he will notice soon i think they exchange discords recently so things might be happening outside 4channel
  i always got the impression he is way more into her than she is him
this thread was good
  im 2 of these as i stated in the beginning of my second post that i was someone who had already responded    and there is no transitioning to /cgl/ you can be a sex worker and also like wearing j fashion and doing cosplay
  sounds perfect
  i had the opposite impression but whatever as long as they dont leave us out i want to know every single detail they just too cute
  what does ph stand for i dont know the story but maybe she should reach out if she didnt actually reject him
tfw your kink interests tend towards sensual but everyone else seems to want rough
if the new thread isnt gullrider fans unite edition im gonna pretty upset ngl
  pyramid head silent hill
  howdoes that work you like showing dominance by being hurt  claw into my back now bitch fuckin slap my face you can guzzling slut     is it like power bottom kind of thing
  can guzzling    my sides
  no ones wished you luck yet so here you go good luck gull
  affectionate vulnerable with me loves to laugh foreplay all day giving brunette communicates thoughts and feelings well patient loves my outfits loyal and loves me to no end  im very loyal so i want to throw all my eggs into one kind basket
  pyramid head joined the faxcgl discord to ask cosplay questions and confirm he was good enough for her so at least one of them thinks this can actually go somewhere  either that or this is a really big larp
  drink as low calorie a drink as you can la croix  vodka does it for me and nothing to stain if it spills
  there was no transition for me i always kept that life away from my personal life i always had fun with cosplay but i would never combine the two it just seems creepy to me
  thats not true anon females are actually more likely to see someone as more attractive than they are if they have good insides men are the ones that lose their shit for visuals and then get mad when they realize they didnt check the personality
  doesnt even sound like youre asking much
two months into relationshipgoing well  discover bf is into the same stuff im into  time to spice it up  seemed like a good idea until he insists i wear my sign that he owns me daily including in lolita  yeah nojpeg  tried to explain why i dont wanna mix kink stuff with daily stuff otome mainly/lolita on top of the fact that it doesnt even match at all  even try to compromise by saying i can do it but only at home where no one but him can see me  apparently too hard for his pea brain to understand and im being picky and a bad sub  why must boys be dumb gulls  lolita is obviously more important than dick so hell have to go if he cant understand i dont want someone unable to respect my life choices
  dump  his  ass
  what a terrible dom  its not okay to shame or coerce your partner into things if theyve already told you they dont want to do it    dont compromise on this if he doesnt get it reconsider having a sexual relationship with him   sounds like hes got a 50 shades mentality and has no clue that bdsm relationships are a twoway street  hes selfish and disrespectful
  we are going strictly by looks here and studies suggest that the more physically attractive someone is the better people perceive their personality
   what was the one you didnt match
  im going to take a guess and say the porn
    you got me if youre not drinking your way through a math degree at a 70 male school theres only so many options left
  is it no porn while in the relationship or no porn ever
  dr simi qlao
  anyone into kink who doesnt immediately renege when you set a hard boundary is someone you should never ever engage in any kind of bdsm with play is only play when its consensual negotiating boundaries is essential and if hes not respecting something as major as no 24/7 hes not someone you can ever trust to respect a safe word    good on you link him a bdsm etiquette for dummies page on your way out but dont stick around
finally building up my wardrobe  have very eclectic taste in lolita  love sweet   love gothic   keep buying pastel dresses but only ever have black shoes/accessories   none of my headbows match my dresses   why the fuck did i buy a purple blouse nothing else in my lolita wardrobe is purple
  work out  yes
  let those cucks line up
  and also captured    and gay  
  why is masochism so common with male anons on this website  cause they are so desperate they take anything what they get

losing my hair guess this will make wigs easier to wear but goodbye to being a cute boy
  i ve been losing my hair since i was 18
i bit the bullet and ordered a full sillicon breastplate thing to do a 2b cosplay     hopefully it looks good once it arrives and matches my skin colour somewhat
  shave it and go perma wig
  hey if shinuki was able to do it maybe you too will be able to pull off that cosplay
  try toppik ive been losing my hair and no one can tell thanks to that  lil hair fibre powder that insta fills in bald spots
does anybody have the raw pictures of sneakys crossplays    i prefer his unphotoshopped look
how difficult would it be for someone who has never sewn before to create this outfit before halloween
  just buy one itll be infinitely better than anything youre making for the next 8 months
  go to aliex or whatever store and buy an outfit sewing needs practice and experience if youre not fulltime learning till halloween you wont make it it will look awful
  anon learning how to sew a maid dress  apron is possible in a month hopefully anon already has a sewing machine but sewing by itself isnt difficult and something simple like in the picture will take 23 weekends at most
any recommendations for crossplay with horns i cant narrow it down preferably something nonrevealing
  seems like a silly question you should be cosplaying characters you personally like instead of what other people like
  do you know of any good resources to learn from how did you learn it if i may ask im not that anon but im totally new looking for somewhere to start
  anon this is probably a silly question but i want you to be honest with us   do you have actual horns
  nno
  look up the norwood scale if you are 3 maybe 4 or below you can go to a doctor or dermatologist and explain the issue ask to take finnestride to block testosterone from causing additional hair loss and take regaine rogaine to regrow
  theres always the current flavor of the month
  bruh lets keep the tranny hormone shit to /lgbt/
  nyart but thats regular hairloss prevention apparently the endocrine system regulates a lot more than just looking like a girl
  you could just crossplay draco  her looks are somewhat boyish already
be a twinky motherfucker  want to be cute enough to crossplay  beard a black as satans anus  not even a day after hacking it off i have searing pain around my chin line and neck  beards suck ass and i suck ass at shaving it
  do you exfoliate before shaving
  ive tried before ive done the right after a hot shower trick exfoliation a dozen different razors in every combination possible and still no luck
  i feel like facial hair is the most annoying part of trying to cross play i didnt have any until 20 but its thick and black so its like impossible to get rid of completely the only ways ive been told is to wax electrolysis or razor  make up only electrolysis is permanent chemicals didnt really work when i tried and my skin looked burned good luck
halloween is coming  are you going to dress as something cute
  already got plans but the halloween pub crawl the weekend before i might wear wednesday
  holy fuck this wouldve been a shitty get
  imagine being such a small person you make this post
  i wish i was a small person
hey id like to start getting into crossplay and im pretty new could anyone link me good clothes to start out with panties skirts etc   thanks
  dont shave it youre suppose to pluck it
i wanna cosplay because it allows me to crossdress outside but im not a weeb    feelsbad
  nigga which animes girl do you find qt  which designs look so bombtastic you wanna wear it  thats opinionated shit and fashion is in general
  i wanna cosplay  but im not a weeb    but no one forces you to cosplay anything japanese
is it better/easier for a guy to crossplay as a trap than a girl
  is it easier to cosplay something thats designed to look like a girl but has a dick or cosplay a girl except you have a dick     real big fucking thinker there
  no bulli  most trap characters are almost girls anyhow
  asuka in her plugsuit or just shinji in asukas plugsuit figuring how daring i want to be in public
  thats because of the clothes tho  take a character like felix argyle you see him as a girl because thats how you first saw him if you see him wearing his knights clothes or when hes wearing rags you notice that his shoulders are broad he maintains a masculine frame hes just ultrafeminine  this happens with other characters like astolfo too  crossdressing is not just wearing girl clothes is using those clothes to make your bodyline look as feminine as possible making your shoulders and waist look narrower and your hips wider this not only applies irl but in anime too i know that most artist just draw a girl and call it a dude but some actually try  having said that always keep in mind that a skirt is easier than a dress and that with more clothes/accesories its kinda easier to look feminine also dont use your natural hair it can work but youll be much safer with a wig  also makeup  thats about it just find a character that you like and give it a try
  you got any suggestions on trap characters im definitely aiming for as many clothes and accessories as possible to try and be passable
  watarase jun asuka minato hideri hideyoshi the cast of fukaboku arikawa hime and his little brother and morale committee members or just reference   crossdressing maid akihisa  takanashi kotori gjbus kyoro
  i dont know your body type nor your tastes so its kinda pointless to ask me  just type trap anime character or anime trap or something like that in google and see if you find something that you like
so im kind of obsessed with the winter serafuku whats the best way to get one unfortunately im not in the usa been eyeing the ines in ezcosplay but feel kind of expensive
  its from bodyline
  i know thats just an example
i fucking hate these threads now    chasers  fetishists   trap faggots    reform now
  reform now    how are we supposed to reform this thread
  pretty silly because other than learning how to tuck your dick or contouring a lot of the general advice can be gotten elsewhere just dont be a faggot and say youre a man in a dress and meld with the other anons
  this
  i bit the bullet and ordered a full sillicon breastplate thing to do a 2b cosplay   hopefully it looks good once it arrives and matches my skin colour somewhat    let us know how that goes there is a lack of reviews on these fake butts and tits     which one did you buy
thoughts  no makeup or anything yet obviously just a trial with the outfit
  work on standing like a woman ffs also the wig looks pretty bad maybe look for something a bit fuller/longer
  basically what said  also is that with the breast form   doesnt seem shaped at all but its a bit hard to see with your fucking phone directly in front of your chest
  oh nah im not  no tits fake or otherwise  yeah actually standing like a girl is a big issue for me i can sometimes do better than that but i still struggle with it
has anyone put out a good guide on female posture that isnt some crazy nutter 60 year old hon shit     ive purchased two guides on posture but havent had time to watch them ive also got a corset but it can only be used under a few costumes     just my opinion but the way i see it is that women tend to have a greater s shape to the spine as they counter the extra weight of their beasts and hips
going as a witch still a work in progress im not sure about the bra or the corset underneath i get upper back fat from the corset bra is a 38dd i cant tell if i should go bigger or smaller for a more realistic form     also yes i know about the veiny arm im going to wax and not drink 100 oz of water / work out the day of the party so there really isnt a need to talk about that i got that one figured out
    one more
  tbqh famalam from the side it looks like you used tennis balls to mimic tiddiesyour bust needs to be shaped more smoothly right now it lacks a softer more natural curve
  tbqh famalam from the side it looks like you used tennis balls to mimic tiddiesyour bust needs to be shaped more smoothly right now it lacks a softer more natural curve    i know right its got like that 1950s jet cone bra look     the crazy thing is thats just a normal 38dd bra from target with rice/hose boobs the kind that girls use to simulate breast implants before picking a size
  looks good
  thanks im still working on posture and i guess i should go for the shoes at some point
  you either need to get more upper breast fullness to smooth the curve out or go down a cup size or 2 have you tried the corset upside down to see if the shape works better that way if its supposed to be a womens one they often have more space at the bottom for hips
  you either need to get more upper breast fullness to smooth the curve out    how does one do this persay    i got this corset        105 length length
  depends on the bra if you have a full coverage bra you may be able to stuff the hose more if not you may need something more like foam breast pads    corset wise  the brand doesnt really matter it matters whether it fits you better upside down as even though its sold as an mtf corset its pictured on a female and looks like it may have more space in the hips than the ribs you could also try lacing it in more of a v shape to avoid the back fat
  was testing a hip pad i made and some new clothes that came in got a 38c no hip pad on this size though    for hip pad go to 
      does anyone have experience with a home laser hair removal device
53  115 lb  but very coarse facial hair that grows to the surface within an hour  tried plucking and the hair is too brittle so just snaps at the root instead of pulled out with it
  im testing two things right now to get a better shave     1 moisturize the face daily between shaves at the very least this is helping with redspots after the shave havent had any since i started this     2 im going to do the hot towel pre shave and i got a hot soap foam dispenser im going to see if this helps any with getting a better shave
  im ahead of the curve on this considering my hobby is luxury wet shaving and not the overpriced shit quality trash from the art of shaving either ive got so many preshave oils shave soaps akin to hot soap foam especially when you have a scuttle witch hazel based aftershaves post shave balms post post shave moisturizers etc plus only using a single blade instead of the face lawn mowers gelette advertises these days is a better way to avoid face irritation just has a steep learning curve it was the only way i could actually get a clean shave in the first place my hair just grows back too fast even if i shave close im actually more surprised that you guys dont bring it up more often in these threads i do g get irritation or razor bumps anymore and my hair actually gets cut down to nonvisible status
  the 38c sits more natural on you while the 38dd is way too perky for that amount of boob
  probably because that kind of shave regime takes a lot of time you can just do a decent shave job and cover with makeup in the time it would take to do a proper shave but if you have the time to do both then i can see it being worth it
  probably because that kind of shave regime takes a lot of time you can just do a decent shave job and cover with makeup in the time it would take to do a proper shave but if you have the time to do both then i can see it being worth it    dont you have to use like darker makeups to really hide a poor shave    i would think many here would be aiming for lighter skin tones given the source materal whitch girl and b2 have light skin
  what i do is apply a hot wet cloth to the area you plan to shave to open the pores up then when you finish apply a cold wet cloth to close those pores up having laser done though it alright as it reduces growth enough for you to notice the difference in your skin and the hair when it grows back make sure you have good blades too do not overuse you will notice the difference    covering it with makeup is an art in itself as you need to find the right products for you i used to use tv production tier makeup as i have very dark hair but mac sp15 liquid foundation is pretty good and i was putting off liquid foundation off for some time
  hmmm i might have to buy some brest forms off ebay that have some slope to them i want large enough breasts that it counters some of my square shoulders but i dont want to look like a 1990s drag queen /
  trans woman here cant recommend ipls which somehow hurt even more than real laser which you cant get at home but basically hardly work at all sorry
  hey trans woman give us your non hrt secrets
is there a makeup tutorial you all would recommend for a cutesy look a lot of places ive gone to for handson assistance usually try to do a smoky or sexy western look which ended up looking terrible    a lot of youtube videos end up throwing a bunch of different products and brands at me and i end up getting overwhelmed
not sure if this belongs in the nanchatte thread but would it work without any padding or other feminine shape wear
opinions first costest of astolfo i did with the help of my gf 3
  help of my gf  does she like you crossdressing most girls like manly men and crossdressing is quite the opposite making you unattractive to her
am i fine using an electric razor it will be a while before i can wax and i hate using chemicals
  depending on your hair color and structure it can leave like a shadow on your skin and will stubble quite fast again    i do not recommend using wax but sugaring sugaring is non chemical and will not stick to your skin making it a little less painfull  ripping out your hairs however can be a bad idea if your prone to ingrown hairs it can be horrible and long lasting    so if its a one timer and you want to be safe and dont need 100 smooth skin just use a razor which still can lead to ingrown hairs more over if you press too hard to get it as smooth as possible
  most    well that answers your question then
  cute
  the size looks natural on you im sure with the breast plate it will look smooth and realistic as for the corset you need to make it looser at the top are you tying it in the middle or on the top or bottom
  use benefit concealer the high coverage pot is about 15 and works very well use a lighter shade than your skintone and apply it around your mouth area then put on foundation over with a beauty blender
  its gonna hurt but try nair or waxing
  cute but i would work on making your eyebrows thinner and using makeup tricks to extend your lipline
  nair on your face  enjoy your cancer
  looks okay
  i wish i had a crossdressing bf im so jealous
  crossdressing boy here you dont know what youre getting into     ot what kind of corset should i get are there different types i just want a slimmer hour glass look
  totally making asuka from senran kagura its gonna be awesoooome
  i straight forgot the pic fml
im a taller guy in decent shape 63 180lbs with super stereotypical slavic features any recommendations for characters to crossplay as that wont look weird
  victoria vinciguerras the same height as you
2 questions    1 what is the best way to stay consistent in terms of makeup is it just constant practice im practicing whenever im able to but there are times where i think my makeup looks great and other times where i just absolutely hate it but go fuck it    2 i had someone in an earlier thread suggest for face contouring that i look up how drag queens do their makeup but every one that ive seen goes way too drag for a lack of a better term is there one that really doesnt go too over the top or is better suited for cross play also any makeup that anyone here would suggest for face contouring or can i get away with using my current eye shadow selections for highlighting and whatnot
  random mua here whos somehow stumbled across this thread and yeah people try and recommend lots of tips and shortcuts but in my experience the only way youll ever be able to improve your makeup is by practice     do you have a skincare routine one thing i recommend a lot and what worked for me when i was starting out is every night before washing my face for bed practice loads of makeup techniques in loads of different colours to see what suits you best since you can immediately get rid of it afterwards without feeling bad     as for contouring though i basically hate every online contouring tutorial because literally like everyones face is different yeah there are very general rules that often work but never in the same way on everyone you really have to get to know your own face to find how to contour best or it can look as you said obvious and draggy   if you wanted no pressure you could post a pic and i could give you some advice specific to you     also in terms of product nah youre good contour and highlight powder is just big eyeshadow and though its a little bit more convenient being in a big pan for a big brush its not necessary youre fine just sticking with shadows
is there a reason 2b is so popular for crossplay
  the dress greatly conceals your shoulders n shit    also you can do a lot of enchancements with it to your shape
  besides a standard face washing i dont really do anything else skincare wise also i can post pics were you wanting my crossplay pics or my face or both
  regular pics would be good crossplay is time too but it would be easier if i could see the natural contours of your face     also is there a specific character youre thinking of doing
  fine not time
  vidya that people like  dress that they like  a lot of facial masking stuff like wig and straps on face
  aight top 2 are pictures are me the bottom 2 are recent crossplays one of them shows how i think i did pretty decent on eyeliner eyeshadow and makeup left while the other i just could not make it look good to save my life right basically showing my said inconsistency    as for characters im wanting to do im currently working on doing a hilda crossplay under night inbirth with a plan on hopefully doing bad girl no more heroes next
  1/4  gonna be sectioned into parts lol bc my comment is too long  oh wow first off you have a really cute vshaped face that and the big round eyes will give you a huge advantage with cosplay makeup     im going to go over what i see and im really apologetic if i come off as critical i think you look great and i just want to help ya be even better  and these are just suggestions def dont change something you like just because i say something different     first off heres what id do for base makeup you dont seem to have a 5oclock shadow in the crossplay pics so i wouldnt bother with colour correcting unless you notice that irl plus you have smooth skin so go easy on the foundation but you do have quite deepset eyes same dude i know the struggle and youre not offsetting that enough with the makeup make sure your concealer is at least a shade and a half lighter than your actual skintone and apply like this  under the eyes and blend blend blend if you want product recommendations for anything btw i can do that too i just really like talking makeup   next of course always set with translucent powder
  2/4  next contour ok so i wouldnt even touch the sides of your nose with any contour powder your nose is fairly strong from the front and you dont want to accentuate that so dont contour the sides of your nose at all what you may like though is to take a smaller powder brush and very lightly dust some contour powder over the bridge of your nose to slightly push it in from frontview your cheekbones are pronounced so i also wouldnt contour there as were trying to make your face sort of softer and more feminine i would definitely work around your jawline though which is kind of sharp and instead of putting contour under the jaw like people normally do would put it lightly directly on the jawline taking it up like an inch higher toward the ear as you move to the sides of your face if thats unclear lemme know and ill draw a diagram that technique will especially look nice in pictures or if you have a faceframing wig also make sure the colour is not warm toned whatsoever youre fairly pale and itll look mostly like dirt on your face im thinking a colour somewhat like warm taupe from the modern renaissance eyeshadow palette if you know that one   next is blush blush is just cute so have fun with it where you put the brush down after picking up product will be where its strongest so plop that right on the apples of your cheeks and blend up towards your cheekbones blending it directly on your cheekbones like people often do daytoday will just angle your face more not ideal   highlighter is optional but usually a fun choice  just make sure its blended and subtle and itll usually look great in cosplay
  3/4  ok now eyes i really really like your eyebrows and honestly wouldnt change anything except maybe practicing to make sure theyre both even but the shape is really soft and cute  in the second crossplay pic are you wearing eyeshadow if so it looks nice as well  im going to be totally honest though im not a huge fan of your eyeliner in the second one its sort of a bit too subtle for cosplay makeup and doesnt do much for you and in the first one its a bit messy and unflattering biggest thing to remember is that you have round eyes when your eyeliner wing points down like that it makes your whole eye droop down      for some inspiration and good tutorials kleiner pixel also has slightly downturned eyes but does some amazing and super characterized cosplay makeup      see how in this one she makes the wing go up before the end of her eye that way she brings her whole eye upwards instead of down though the bottom eyelash thing isnt super necessary for you and takes a lot of skill to get right  also make sure to always wear false lashes cosplay is all about the extremes and i cant think of a single female cosplay where i wouldnt wear false lashes mascara cant even come close to the effect especially in pictures   going back to eyeshadow for a second just also want to say thats basically must as well even if the character doesnt wear eyeshadow just running a tiny bit of whatever contour or bronzer you use on your face in the crease and outer v even if people cant tell youre wearing eyeshadow makes all the difference
  4/4  i think the only thing that i have left to say is lips but thats very much a case to case basis lipstick is also kind of a necessity though even if just a nude i also think that overlining just a tad would be really really flattering on you there are tons of tutorials online to make it look natural just make sure you practice a little highlighter on the centre of the lips cupids bow wouldnt suit you is always a nice touch as well     for those two characters though the makeup looks pretty standard other than hildas 2 different coloured irises and lilac lips and for bad girl you should definitely go heavy on peach coloured blush and highlighter on the cheeks and nose and use lip gloss for hilda id use lashes like this   heavy on the outside and for bad girl like this  fluttery and sectioned and round that alone would differentiate the makeup looks a lot    and yeah i think thats about it like i said love talking about makeup so if you have any questions def ask hope this helped in some way
absolutely appreciate the advice and criticism ill also comment on specific things you mentioned      on your comment for colour correcting i actually get a pronounced 5oc shadow but i use an nyx orange lip gloss/stick in addition to a concealer to remove that blue hue its probably not the best method but its the one thats been the easiest for me ill look more into actual color correcting though i would also love product recommendations since what i use are a combination of mom/sister hand me downs friend/yt recs and ipsy monthly bags thats basically like makeup lootbox      when you say contour power are you talking about something specific     for the jaw contouring if you could draw a diagram forthat would help     for blush i actually used to use it but everytime i have in the past i looked more like a doll or like raggedy ann so i stopped but ill give your suggestion of blending it up instead of on a try      i recently started to trim my eyebrows since someone suggested that would help me quite a bit before they were definitely thicker     i was actually using eyeshadow in the 2nd pic and the eyeliner set i use dollywink smokey brown has a bit of a schematic on how to apply it properly so for every crossplay ive been basically doing that    i absolutely appreciate your criticism and videos for my eyeliner ill definitely give them a watch     i actually do wear false lashes but they never seem to show up in pictures maybe im not applying them correctly    oooh i love those lashes gonna definitely pick them up      sorry if these comments are all over im still pretty new to makeup in general
  still not enough ass pats or something not sure why you felt the need to post some potato quality sideways shit
what are the best trap cosplay items from amazon i was thinking of crossplaying for the first time i wanted to buy these        
planning on the saints from hitman absolution wearing a generic nun costume with a cat suit underneath
  i would personally advise buying that wig guarantee its going to be shitty quality
  advise against fuck
  latex or other material
try to sound like a girl  best attempt sounds like a gay middle age man  still talked in my man voice  fuck
  the only thing stopping me from crossplaying is not having someone preferably a gf to cosplay with at a con all my friends are just fratty or not into cons
  spandex
            same person as the witch earlier continuing to workshop the fake hips ass and tits     i got an electric carver the kind used for chickens and that is definitely the way to go with making your own hip/ass pads     thoughts so far if you are going with 3 inch foam to get bigger hips go longer than you think you need in my opinion i need to go another 4 inches on the top part of the hip and i need to put on the corset first then 1 layer of hose then the hip pads then two more layers of hose hose should go up to the natural waist    i have no idea what im going to do about the butt even with a bit of butt on the sides im not seeing any gains on the butt i think i need to add 2 inches to the diameter of the butt     im still getting a little back fat with the corset at the top but positioning the bra strap just right smooths a lot of it out     other stuff my natural hip is 23 inches in dia this is using 3 inch thick foam and gives me 27 dia hips     any feedback would be appreciated ill keep trying stuff in the hopes of coming up with a formula that works for others     feedback i already know is that the pics are blurry i need better lighting and i need to wax before going out in public my main focus was to just try the pad in pants ill dig out my real people camera and tripod for future tests
  middle
  breast plate    breast plate huh    
  dude those hips do not look realistic at all especially with that flat af ass
    i know i
  cute cute
im pretty happy with how this costume turned out i posted it previously in the halloween thread since i wore it for halloween too
noice
how do you hide a large adams apple
  chocker i assume like most others
  cute
  pretty good desu
i want to dress as a petite character should i get shapewear that focus on my waist hips or the full body    cute
  main focus should be wait and hips to get them to the point where theyre in proportion with your shoulders the hardest part about crossplay/crossdressing outside of getting your face looking feminine enough is to get it so that your figure looks in proportion for a girls and the biggest obstacle for that is the shoulders and the best way to do that is to make the hips look bigger i guess an example would be the marisa cosplay i posted where i used a hoop crinoline to hide my hips and poofy sleeves to hide my shoulders though often even a big enough jacket can be enough to make you somewhat passable if your face isnt completely hopeless
  so im kind of obsessed with the winter serafuku whats the best way to get one  i actually got a genuine used japanese winter sailor fuku top on ebay from a seller in osaka for a reasonable price really well made as its an actual school uniform with lining and stuff the costume versions omit they are very expensive new have to do a few mods for size but it will work and the sailor top is the hard part to get     add a navy pleated skirt from a domestic school uniform supplier like french toast western girls get big so waist sizes in excess of 30 inches are no problem along with length and this makes for a real schoolgirl uniform you wont get from either a tiny stock japanese one or a cosplay one you can tell from the pics is never quite the same as the real ones
quick question  are traps cosplay crossplay or drag
  drag
alright guys im jumping into this crossplay completely blind and im not sure how to get started     im already a small skinny dude but i have hair on my legs and arms so other than shaving that off what else i look pretty young too i guess im 18 but people think im 15
  makeup clothing
  if you look good then its crossplay if you look terrible its drag
  shaving skincare makeup also whats your personal goal got any characters you really like to cosplay or a certain fashion style you want to jump into
  what character is this
  yes to both    id like to think i look good but i wanna go full force i suppose    right now i suppose just looking more feminine im really into chinese outfits and some characters from fighting games because thats all i play lol and yuyuko saigyouji because i love her    may from guilty gear    sorry for the 7 hour late reply i go to bed early
  just wanted to reply and say good taste on may my dude you actively play rev 2
  first off i prefer jam second no    i cant seem to stick with a fighting game so i often just jump around to whatever i feel like playing for the week gimme your discord or whatever ill still play you
what are the absolute mininum makeup components i should get familar with before expanding foundation blush lip gloss and eyebrow pencil
  tlou on discord but youve already talked with me i believe
hey guys browsed through this board a bit and i think its mostly guys crossplaying as girls im kind of hoping for some advice though the other way round im a girl who used to crossplay when i was a younger teen because i could pull off the young lanky guy look and really had fun doing it ive wanted to try again for years in my mid 20s now but it just looks like shit whenever i try my face is very very feminine as are my mannerisms and i feel like ill just look dumb my figure also make it impossible to make my body look like a dudes its just so obvious as im quite thin and curvy and if i do it i want to do it right     i know to crossplay girls theres padding and breastplates you can buy or tutorials on how to make them but i havent found any good ones on girls anyone have any tips on making your body look more masculine is there padding you can buy or am i just kind of stuck working with what i have
  chest binder and padding you want to make your body look more blocky and square one thing most ftm crossplayers do is forget to add extra padding and account for their hips so they end up looking dumpy and pearshaped you also might want to look into male contouring which is another thing most people get wrong and mannerisms/vocal patterns are also important to practice my recommendation would be to try and sing along with more male songs think johnny cash and copy the speech patterns and tone it wont be perfect but itd at least be a decent start
  the three basics i always tell people to go with are lashes lips and brows once youve got those down pat then you can start adding to the face to get the look you want
tfw i have the perfect body for crossplay but the worst face for crossplay
  things that cover up necks like scarves
  so the only thing stopping you is you
  have an androgynous face  half chinese  but also addicted to working out so ive got like a mini van darkholmeesque body    granted i just want to crossplay as female ranma but i suppose it will be a limiter
lost coat check ticket in con while crossplaying   have to give photo id in for verification since i dont have my ticket anymore   coat check lady looks confused and back between me and my girlfriend  this is a boy id  i am a boy  shes puts on a shocked face and proceeds to get our stuff    funny happening at least i got unbaised confirmation that i pass
   finasteride has nothing to do with lgbt
how do i get rid of my skinnyfat
  run
  runswim eat oatmeal
  eat oatmeal    im not following whats so special about that
  healthy and no fat or sugar getting rid of sugar is the big deal
  aight i guess i can do that    i can only do two of those things i have no pool
  halfway correct what makes oatmeal good is how filling it is keeping you from eating more the no sugar is good but people tend to add milk and sugar to make it edible anyway plain old oatmeal will make you not wanna eat it more than once and you shouldnt have to force a diet because you wont stick with it if you dont enjoy it     sugar is a big enemy but everything is fine in moderation oatmeal helps you moderate better by making you full longer brown rice has the same effect switch your rice to brown by the way fat isnt an enemy though and in fact america is a perfect example of why fat is required in a healthy diet  after the low fat grocery fad popped up and health sources started giving it a bad rap we saw an increase in obesity due to everyone thinking if i cut far from my diet i will be less fat and then proceeding to buy foods that have low fat but compensate with the bland ass flavor by adding loads of sugars whomever named it fat did an extreme disservice to future generations  it should have been named lipids so that it doesnt have the canotation to the layman of this will make me fat our digestive system is way more complicated than this and you need lipids as a dietary requirements     the bottom line is you need to balance your diet everyone who says eliminate this and that and this will lead you down the road every fatty faces youll be miserable with what you eat and still be fat your fridge will be filled with products they guests will not want to fucking touch when they come over youll be overeating to compensate for your bodys natural cravings for essential nutrients that youre denying it and youll be thinking well maybe i need to work out more and inevitably that will fail too because the fight against obiesity is fought and won on the dinner table find balance eat what you enjoy in moderation take calories into account but dont obsess get more greens and fiber enjoy food
greetings from vienna comic con 2018
  and ill stop here before someone gets sour about me posting multiple images of the same thing again
  besides avoiding sugar and running anything else i should do or not eat    im not too big but i want the skinnyfat gone    cute
tfw walk 8 miles almost every day but still skinnyfat  at least my legs are thicc
  number 1 thing i see crossdressers crossplayers and mtfs do wrong low hips they need to be so much higher right now the curve of the hips seems to start at your hipbone it very very rarely works like that for women the hips should start to flare out just after the waist with the width point being at or just below the hip bone
  they do it that way because you cannot put padding up to its actual position unless youre wearing a bodysuit or something high waisted
  pic or fake
  that image is some primo bait absolutely stealing it
  thats pretty good
any advice on this underboob window cleavage
  basically something like pic related   the window is pretty small so you can get away with just a part of that maybe attach it to the top so it stays in shape   that outfit is actually one of the best applications for that technique since you dont have to match the skintone quite as closely
anyone know where to get a face mask similar to this in white
  ebay
  just go to a walgreens and grab some
how do you contour an andro/feminine face for crossplay without looking like a drag queen also any other face makeup tricks to look feminine for crossplay
tips and pointers for wearing a skirt without showing panties ive crossplayed once before but felt so limited in my movement
  are you serious shorts bloomers basically any shorts work they even have dance shorts and things that are just a bit more than panties and are meant to wear under short shirts like cheerleader skirts ect use your brain anon thats why you have it
  spats are also commonly worn  or just dont wear a stupidly short skirt
    no need to bully him like that not everyone is well versed in girls clothes from the get go
  you practice a lot by yourself keep watching tutorials and get feedback from others every face is different so you have to practice to get the look you want
there will always be a girl thinner younger and prettier than you    no guy will ever truly love you men only ever settle for what they can get men will always be looking for prettier girl and move on when its possible    
lol no shit street goes both ways who cares
why hasnt this fag been banned yet
to be fair though looks are literally the only thing the modern woman has to offer so i cant fault op    dont cook dont clean dont want to work etc
  this shit again  why cant you pedos get a new shtick
  thats what happens when youre inferior in every other way    women play pretend all the time but theyre know deep down inside theyre only capable of doing one thing
mfw degenerate males think i care about what their musty ass pedo self thinks about me or my life
  based on the image you posted weirdly awkward and trying to hide their true feelings gotcha
im hitting animenyc tomorrow with a blackaboo is there anything i should know before going to my first con like will i get a girlfriend there
  i second this how do i get a cute cosplay gf
i got laid at my first anime con youll do fine
  of course just dont be autistic and everyone will be like this guy is based and redpilled and they will suck your dick in a bathroom
  just dont be autistic    why is there always a catch
  how did this process go exactly   did you just strike up a conversation and they were immediately interested  did you cosplay as a certain character  are you a 10/10 or buff
are you retarded because you sure do act like it
  troll
what exactly makes a cosplay bad
  whenever you wear it
  poor construction bought cosplays that are wrinkled and shiny loose threads unhemmed skirts uneven paintjobs shitty wigs no wig for anything other than a buzzcut shiny uncut or unstyled cut or styled in a way that looks bad frizzy thin and bad makeup no makeup at all instathot makeup on characters who are natural looking in canon uneven lines patchy facepaint
  the person wearing it isnt attractive
  no wig for anything other than a buzzcut  what did he mean by this agree with everything else though    also if you cant tell who the character is meant to be even if you know of the character
  i think he just meant that its ok to use your real hair for characters that have a buzz cut or super short hair  i think it can look fine to use your real hair for some costumes just depends on the character
    wigs for all hairstyles other than buzzcuts if you have a buzzcut it will look better than a buzzcut wig and its not going to get greasy or fall out of place throughout the day like longer hair
  huh
  your face
  one that no one remembers
  fat chicks
  belle delphine
  when its just a wig
  i am deeply uncomfortable with how young she looks
  shes 20 already
fatass doing a skinny or fit character
anyone doing something or looking a way me and my clique dont like
easy on the eyes cosplayer  good construction   decent accuracy   if you miss 2 of those 3 points its a bad cosplay
    you basically described momokun in a nutshell
  who dis
  i draw the line when i know the character but cant identify it without the person telling me
adding boobs to something that doesnt have boobs    like ana from overwatch
  kanna kamui
  ana has boobs though
  yeah she does
  i think anon meant making it slutty by showing cleavage or something
what makes a cosplay bad  define cosplay i like short and sweet being as accurate to the idea of a character  you want to fit the looks and personality of the character bring that character to life so bad cosplay is being inaccurate to that  personal pet peeves  most closet cosplay some are valid most are lazy  unnecessarily sexualized costumes  no peach wouldnt wear just a white pushup bra this seems to be much more a girl problem than for guys but this does apply to both deadpool with only a mask and a red banana hammock you know who you are  unironed clothes this ones minor but we can tell when you just pulled it out of your suitcase  no wigs 90 of characters require a wig because anime hair in a few cases you can really stretch and make natural hair work but by and large even a meh wig is better than natural hair especially if youre not matching hair color  body type im not going to call you a fat fuck but if youre cosplaying something like yoko from ttgl and your fupa hangs down over your booty shorts youre not being accurate to character also it probably smells like stale cheese under there
        these and posture posture before looks though unless were talking circus levels of obesity  also if its just lewd near naked dressup for internet points and attention whoring
not being anzu doll like  bad  if you look like anzu  good
  why
  nayo cosplay  thats a guy right 
  good lord sucking anzus fat dick on an anonymous image board isnt going to get you any closer to her
  her
  poor choice of character narutard  poor deguisement shitty hair  poor body fatass
  implying anzu isnt a cute girl boy
  google nuns then google sexy nuns there you go
  when the costume is actually made badly unironically or when anyone and their mother think they can cosplay dva just because that bought a spandex suit
black friday sale all itas must go edition

  looks like a start of a milk maid porno
  who claimed this to be lolita
she wore this to give a presentation about jfashion mana help us
  god i know its not her she was way bigger but there was a girl in my comm briefly who wore that exact outfit and insisted everyone call her dolly strawberry
  wow what an ugly replica
  haha holy shit its where he stood
    bodyline squirrel party  that pose  that makeup  username midnightwolf21  resemblance to pic related
  the squirrels are cute af one of them looks extra sassy love it sadly i dont like the cuts
  wholesome itas
  replica if not still yike yike
  i wish i could look this agressive in goth my poor baby face
i wish the harness and sailor suits would go away
  i like harnesses but the ones that go around your tits  giant tits  barf
  its like they just gave up halfway trough the coord
  this sucks because her features are so nice and she has potential to look attractive but she would have to change everything her shitty fashion gross kink harness shit her ratty hair put on a fucking bra
  no head accessories or hand accessories fishnets white mixed with ivory this looks like half a coord shes very pretty no doubt but her outfit is half asked and she knows it
  old
  what on earth was the presentation like was there a slideshow
  this was honestly something i didnt get at first until i photographed one of my coords once i saw the pictures it suddenly clicked it looked so weird and out of place
  oh fuck i know her
  i saw this and like why are you acting as an expert/ambassador for jfashion and japanese brands whilst wearing all offbrand and an infanta dress i feel like ive seen newbie itas do this before and it hurts me
  holy fuck burn this replica toy fantasy does not deserve this
  oh god this was my first lolita dress the flowery one back in about 2007 im embarrassed just seeing it again
  shes an ita mess both in dress and in personality acts like some kinda goddamn knowitall around even shittier itas like shes the ita queen of the midwest
  oh man tho anon you shoulda seen my getup for my high school presentation on lolita fashion in like 2005 or 2006 i wore a regular tank top and a hot topic tutu underneath a short crownprint skirt that was sold to me as baby the stars shine bright it clearly wasnt but i bought into it at the time and bought it and the other people in my group project werent dressed much better i really wish i had photos
  to be fair the fashion and information about the fashion was nowhere near as accessible at the time so being ita in the west was a lot easier nowadays theres no excuse
    jesus christ    imagine  its early in the morning  you woke up only minutes ago sitting in front of your pc eating breakfast and checking on the gull board  still dark outside only your screen and a small lamp on your desktop lighten up your room  youre still half asleep and just seeing the usual ita stuff nothing special  click on one random coord pic that actually looks decent judging by its thumbnail  suddenly you see pic related  immediateley close window staring into emptiness  be spooked for the rest of the morning    i swear by mana it took atleast a minute for my brain to process what it just saw
    why is everyone such fucking slobs are they all spoonies  spent time wearing a thing  too much anxiety to wash my face  oh well  we cant all be perfect  self love  not washing is self care
  jesus fucking christ this is enough intarwebs for today
i dont know how to feel about the one on the left calling herself a sweet lolita(((yikes)))  thoughts 
  just your standard attention whores
  triggers the fuck out of me that the title of that video   calls her a lolita doll
  cursed image
  this is ugly but in an endearing teen ita phase shell eventually grow out of kind of way
    guess you got to that anon cause they made another thread just to nitpick this girl   
  details
    sissies btfo one of these ill be triggered into killing
  she looks like a soundcloud rapper
  if you watch it she is she just wasnt wearing lolita during the interview they show several pictures of her coords
      im not opposed to oldlitas i am one but we have to work twice as hard to look half as good also i think if you put a sticker over the face of  itll be fine im assuming sissy       looks like something kbd would wear      im not a big fan of lady sloth shops stuff anyway she hasnt seen a doctor yet
  nasty neons instead of pastels  weird cheap lace everywhere   whatever the fuck is going on with those bodice ruffles  absolutely a replica pretty sure its ripping off pic related
  besides the potentially odd makeup kind of hard to tell with the lighting i like this     also that shop looks cute as fuck
  whats the name of this print its v cute apart from the makeup/piercings and the boobloafingits not a half bad coord
  clicking expand on this was a mistake a fucking tit explosion
  i mean the date says 2013 hopefully shes grown out of it since shes likely no longer a teen
  dear lord i want to do a themed op coord subtly and this makes me want to cry and never come close to trying stop
  thats aps lyrical bunny i cant find it on lolibrary right now for some reason
  i think this is the same girl   
  christ on a bike  i dont know if it was supposed to be her goal to look scary but if it was then good on her because she made it
  jesus fuck those are actualy anime tiddies also she could be cute if she put effort into it but with those giant boobs she wont ever fit into brand
  she did it to im
  pic related   also that makeup is awful and please do our eyebrows if youre going to do a close up
  any else ever notice cows with tits like this are constantly bragging about them whats the point your tits hang down passed your gut and are useless at that point
  this
  the jsk is lyrical party only the bag and the accessoires were lyrical bunny
  the first two pics are almost sure from a sissy no women has such a face
    
  thatd do it i knew it wasnt quite right
    youre right and i dont mind bio males wearing the fashion but put on some damn makeup or somethingtheres tons of tutorials online specifically for men even draglevel makeup is better than none
    while i like neither theres something different about a crusty guy without makeup wearing lolita and a fucking sissy who has this goddamn creepy smile every time he wears it fuck sissies man
    the look on the husbands face oh my god
lolita fetish pics
  thats not how you wear that dress
  not that anon but she constantly posts on facebook about how shes being attacked her favorite word for some reason is keyboard warriors  shes always posting about her boyfriend and being lonely and generally digging for attention  she acts really coarse and bitchy when anyone talks to her too    desu though i think she normally dresses pretty well but occasionally has a train wreck outfit like that
  wtf is up with her tiddies
this is adorable as cosplay but hideous as lolita am i wrong this is one reason why normies are so confused about this fashion  i may be a little touchy after an incident a few weeks ago concerning fashion being confused for cosplay but i dont think im wrong about this
  id say its more fine than adorable as cosplay of what but in no way would i even consider this lolita bad normie wannabe lolita is almost always marked by the notion that any dress with a fitted bodice and a full skirt can be accessorized into a kawaii loli outfit desu w i guess a lot of modern lolita looks tend towards a more princess vibe than in previous eras but theres still no way or need to make that dress work for lolita    at the very least put on a pair of red shoes ffs what is the twisted logic behind those brown heels
  is this not a strawberry shortcake cosplay lol
  i dont like it as cosplay either the colors dont work gross off pink shoes bright green tights neon pink petti and pastel pink they clash so hard the peeking petti isnt cute and the wig is too modern for the outfit
  not knowing strawberry shortcake   w e w
  was this taken in 2009 it looks like it
    still ita even by 2009 standards
  op its sad when i personally know the girl in the picture
  is she wearing wrist cuffs on top of her bodyline socks or am i just an idiot and those are sock toppers is that even a thing
  sock toppers used to be a thing not sure when they rose to popularity if at all but i remember seeing tutorials for sock toppers floating around in 2007 they faded out though which is strange because theyre super useful
  didnt claim otherwise i simply asked
  the wig needs to be yarn and the neon pink petticoat must be replaced with white bloomers then it would be a pretty awesome strawberry shortcake themed cord/cosplay
  themed cord  no this isnt lolita and no change would suddenly make it so least of all wearing a yarn wig
  very well it could still be a cute strawberry shortcake cosplay then i suggested the yarn wig because well thats what strawberry shortcakes hair is yarn
  im aware of that but thats inappropriate for lolita are you a cosplayer please lurk more before you comment on a lolita thread again it doesnt seem like you know anything about the fashion namely the fact its a fashion and not a costume
  sorry i flustered your fanny 
  namely the fact its a fashion and not a costume  if it looks liike a duck acts like a duck quacks like a duck and there are themed cords all the time in lolitagoth for example is a theme someone asked for a rabbit themed one in the capsule thread why dont you go there and correct them
  having a motif or theme makes a coord a costume  lol
  sorry i know you spent a lot on it but its still a costume a very pretty costume but still a costume fight me there is a reason lolita is seen as a costume by a lotmost of people
  i thought you said a themed cord wasnt lolita in 
    she said your idea is costumey not the idea of a themed coord     try to wipe the drool from your face its unbecoming
  where does she say that at all in her post maybe reread the sentence   cord  no this isnt lolita and no change would suddenly make it so least of all wearing a yarn wig
  anon is right your reading comprehension needs work
  hmm i dont think so i think her sentence needs to be more specific why green text themed cord if she wasnt referring to it specifically
  to directly comment on the fact that its not and will never be a themed coord because its straight up cosplay does that clear it up
  yes it does thanks
  this is pretty cute obviously not lolita so i dunno why this is even posted
  what can i say except youre welcome
    most likely tagged as lolita on her social media when she posted it
  i think she is wearing a bra
  yeah thats why it was posted along with   read the posts theyre replying to
      as someone who has done both lolita and cosplay let me explain something to you having a themed coord would be akin to a normie wearing a tee shirt depicting a certain holiday/character/whatever instead of just a tee shirt tho the lolita will stylishly and skillfully incorporate elements of said subject holiday/character/whatever into all parts of her outfit but its still an outfit meant to be worn as daily wear there are a few times of the year when the line gets a little blurry like during the high holy lolita holidays of halloween and easter and ott may seem like a costume but thats like a normie dressing up extra nice for a wedding or something yes wigs are involved but not shiny unnaturally colored wigs    a costume is a costume you are dressing as that character its a lovely cosplay and i totally get the brown shoes because im a vintage toy enthusiast also but this isnt a dress you would wear to the mall or out for coffee or in your daily life its not intended to be anything but a costume dress and with the big poofy hat that is especially not something a lolita would wear thats the difference
  nope she posted this on jfashion internal community facebook group and never said anything about lolita people would post anything on ita threads lol
  alright then what was the logic behind wearing a shiny red plastic wig instead of a natural orange
  s m h gothic is a substyle not a theme music is a theme you can have harpsichord trio gothic coords chocolate quartet sweet or that iw violin op and bag for a music themed classic coord
  it honestly looks like a mashup between the old and new strawberry shortcake not a berry good idea imo
  goth for example is a theme  goth    im dying youre so mad instead of standing corrected
    i understood that it was supposed to be strawberry shortcake but can you really call it cosplay of a character if your costume hardly resembles the source material also i admit i did chimp out too hard about the brown shoes which i didnt realize were canon but if youre going to completely disregard the costume why not try to improve it somewhat
  why not try to improve it somewhat  or better yet why not use correct tags instead of classic lolita of all things
  if only you knew how bad things really are
  she still looks awful same with her friend
  except anime tits actually look nice
  you were not around in 2009 were you
  the ivory x white is really the only thing that im bothered by id just ditch that blouse entirely honestly it looks so frumpy and draws focus away from the skirt its a bit minimalistic otherwise but not ita
  underrated pun
  something about the way shes posed creeps me out shes giving me bentneck lady vibes
  i was whats your point
  sure anon
  sorry you got posted
1/2
2/2
  what is wrong with that dress why is there so little skirt fabric
i want 2 die
  oh man i saw this guy on insta a while ago part of me thinks its kinda endearing since he actually seems to get some brand stuff unlike most brolitas and he seems to actually try but he also seems a bit ita and needs a little help im not sure if hes trying to look like a woman or not but im kinda doubting if itll ever work out well for him instead i think he should just focus on the lolita part while hes young so he can be flawless in dress as he ages
  nah she looks more like jeff the killer imo
  blam  
    looks underage    concerned
  i see her braline through her shirt i think she just needs a reduction sometimes insurance will pay for that if you arent morbidly obese she doesnt look like a total planet just kinda fat     she stated that they totally took her out of context she does wear the fashion for real the goth is who im worried about lol tacky as shit all killstar stuff     god i wish this person would quit lolita id never thought people can be too ugly for lolita before i saw her     oh god stop with the ahegao fails im with  im concerned about this kid
  to be fair if i was just handed that dress before id gotten into lolita this is how i would have assumed you wore it
  shes so cute i would love to put her in some innocent world
  people post other bad jfashion on here too its not just for lolita
  why are narutards so dead set on turning their male characters in lolitas
i am not sure where to begin with this mess
  cute  gross landwhale looking like trash    sure
  i saw this girl on cof earlier and i screeched poor girl looks so fucking messy
  i absolutely have no words for this
  garbage angel she flew out of the dumpster with all of the fabric scraps she could carry
  i find it slightly difficult to say this as a diehard pokemon fan but man between the long mormon face pulled back hair and preschool level of dress sense she really does look like a pokemon fan
  she posted this before stop with the fucking black with a light pastel main nothing matches light color or white lolita blouse and tights greatly needed along with some better shoes
  so not only is this ita cosplay theyre also confusing allegedly lolita fashion with maids is that what im looking at here
  this is why i dont go to cons theres the fatties who havent washed for twelve weeks who brush up to you and then theres these demons from hell
  die sissies die
lolita cosplayers
  is this a promo shoot for whoever made that awful stuff the bonnets are so huge and unfortunate with the contrasting overlay      this is is so ugly its almost neat like high fashion concept stuff why would anyone choose neon green and denim for this style of ott sweetclassic
  ott sweetclassic  wat
  the dress itself is super cute and does not deserve this i like it paired with the eevee bag though
  that dress is garbage and everyone knows it
      it is promo for an ugly as sh indie brand
  if not for the wig i would like this a lot  not as lolita though
taged as lolita
  looks lolita to me shes cute i love her entire look besides the plain white tights
  aw i really like her hair and the dress looks like the ap happy easter apron skirt thing
  autismjpg
  this is really cute as casual daily lolita wear imo    not a big fan of the piss yellow color in her hair though
  this is cute fairy kei i like her hair     this is in no way lolita
  call me crazy but i like the concept of the right one it looks like a jester hat with proper construction colors and execution i think a venetian jester themed dress would be kick ass
      the people here saying these travesties are cute are the real itas
  nitpick the only problem is that the hair and the coord clash i like them both separately though
i hate this chick so much
  she has a lot of potential but needs a petticoat like damn girl lemme get u one
  that shoop makes her look like shes wearing the face of a better lolita she stole that lolitas dress too but its too small and she cant zip it up   rip better lolita
  no dont say that i tried to give her concrit and she didnt take any of it to heart
  collar  lemme guess they are also into ddlg or some other degenerate kink
  clown wig  oversized rainbow cardigan    awful
  jfc why cant they keep their collars/tails/ out of lolita as someone into kinky shit its not that fucking hard plus it never looks good with lolita
  thats not a wig you walnut
  well thats unfortunate
  i think the dress is a vm knockoff and the original design is beautiful this is just a shitty approximation of it
  she would be a great aunt jemima
  honey cake coord when  more seriouslyshes actually cutebut with those huge badonkers shell have one hell of a time fitting into lolita so i feel bad for her
  i need a source on that necklace
  i feel like if she had any sense of coordination she could look good in a skirt and highly customized blouse
  mega  i  l  k
  i dont know if she actually is or not but the fact that 90 of her outfits both lolita and not include her wearing some sort of collar or choker i wouldnt be surprised  but i havent been able to find any actual evidence on either of her insta accounts
  yikes
  im questioning your taste levels anon
  doing both too much and not enough makes this hard to concrit sweet lacy basket girl is the best but no headwear bad looking socks and overly casual shoes for a fancy dress snow boots needs to stop trying so hard nothing is working far left needs better socks that match nicer shoes and a simpler hair accessory if shes not going to wear ott classic girl just looks cheap and colorblocked
  theres a line between ita and nitpick this pic is it
  middle left girl is cute and definitely has potential
can a sales post be ita because im fucking rolling at this listing    is that an elizabeth op replica and that price is absolutely insane i feel like its going to desu desu ne at me with really shitty cat ears and ballet flats
  i used to see this girl around manchester theres a lot of shoop on that face she looks much worse in real life if possible
  i love the little earrings if this coordinate was in an asian chick no one would blink
  i feel personally offended by this monstrosity
  the outfits dont bother me as much as the bad shoop its all messed up
  seeing some of her older photos and the weird birthmark she had on her nose im not surprised
  the one in pink looks like she calls the cops on black people as a hobby
im hoping shes trolling
  it is i hate it so fucking much given the elizabeth op is one of my dream dresses
  i mean why would you want the elizabeth op when you have a perfectly fine lace monster right there anon
  people are defending this i think shes pretty but this is a mess    runescape
  sissy and lacemonster
  name a more iconic duoill wait
  why is every lolita ambassador like this
  nitpick honestly wish her fringe was pastel rainbow instead of bright rainbow to match the cardigan and some blue or green tights instead of white would really tie it together
  nitpick with a nasty ass cardigan that doesnt match a lolita aesthetic at all okay
  sorry you got posted but its trash
  the mystery solving duo of harajookoo
  no anon sorry you got posted
a why would you use nothing but selfies for your sales pictures   b girl you look terrible and smelly
  how do you make holy lantern look so classless
  oh wow youre right she is wearing a bra i just saw the size and figured there was no way but youre right maybe losing 20lbs and a reduction would do her some good shes got great skin and her features are so nice too bad about her clothing choices
  this looks like a lolita album cover      this looks like a lolita white trash mixtape cover
  ugh i see why someone would see this as ita but i feel like this could be fixed easily with different legwear a neutral colored wig and a different cardigan or non at all i see where she put her own style in but it was in all the wrong ways    i almost want to photoshop this to see my vision realized but that seems really shitty
    are you telling me that youve never seen a hl ita before
    anyone else besides me notice the butterfly backpack
  girl she needs to lose more like 120 but yes
  oh god
  wrong type of chiffon for the bonnets and terrible terrible gathering you shouldnt be able to see what is behind  op on the right has potential but not for lolita shape and construction looks cute reminds me of something candy stripper would make 10/10 would wear
look who is back
  im a firm believer that a tasteful cleavage can work in lolita but geez no one should see half your tits unless youre a slut    she looks more like shes trying to be some magical fairy than lolita was this tagged as so horrible look no mater what tho just look at those tights if that cleavage wasnt bad enough yet
  i just wish there was as more white/ivory on her legs feet her pale skin and dark hair/makeup makes her look ethereal spooky and i love that vibe
    i saw her at the con knew someone was gonna post her here lol was she trying to go for some kinda deco lolita or something
  unless your representing a brand i dont mind of rand im more wondering why it are always itas who cant coord if their lives depend on it you need to understand stuff before you can teach it to others
  a tasteful cleavage  no such thing in lolita you are in the wrong fashion if you think cleavage in any form can be featured    also having cleavage out in western fashion does not make one a slut   your opinions are p crap
  oh god i remember some threads ago this exact same dress but on a young cute model and several other shots in similar dresses to promote some indie brand that was utterly clueless about lolita all the dresses were made of this same cheaplooking fabric and they all had their cleavage out and pained expressions on their faces like they knew they were wearing crap does this mean they actually sold a dress to someone wow i wish i had capped those
  all i could do after this comment is imagine someone wearing iw violin op and some rando being like  omg shes cosplaying a violin  you made my day thanks for the laugh anon
  i doubt she cares about lolita just another run of the mill costhot
  who is this
  a girl that was very famous in the last ita thread and even made it in btb  had on cof a photo that looked very kinky and everyone thought she was a sissy or into dlg
  are those wristcuffs on her ankles
  those are the shoes moron
    ahegao fails  isnt that supposed to look like extreme sexual pleasure she looks more like shes trying to make a silly face    i wouldnt say she looks underage more like could be underage could also be young adult but does she even know what ahegao is supposed to be this feels like shes trying to mimic something she saw cosplayers she likes/thinks are popular do without having a clue what it is makes me feel even worse for the girl not only failing at a sexualised gesture but also not knowing she does one
  i think there might be shirring on the back thats stretch out so much the skirt becomes small i might be wrong but the front looks folded enough to make me think its not the construction at the front making it look so flat and strait down but rather the back being stretched to a circumference not far from the skirt
      these comments together are funny because iw germaine op is made to be worn like how this dress is supposed to be worn or offshoulder like this girl is doing with this dress    shes on to something just wrong dress and wrong coord
  beautifully ita
  why the white bonnet not surprising that a kinkster would be bad at old school   toddler telekenisischan youve already sullied your name
  this looks like shes one of those cosplay facial masks it looks kinda creepy
  okay obviously the producers took her out of context but ignoring that honestly im kinda jealous of these two id love a bff roommate to live with who was also into alternative fashion we could help each other with makeup and stuff     i also want a pet snail
  honestly i never understood why people hate it i kinda like the design especially this colourway my problem is more all the itas coording it but thats an issue with most fandom dresses    i can see this work when worn in a cute girly outfit without the need to trow pokemon in every bit off accessories keep it more subtle and toned down probably not even lolita but more general japanese girly style
  what is this i dont even
  i just wish her hair was pastel to fit with the outfit but as it looks as if its her real hair dyed i can forgive it as its not the worst combo    honestly i feel that this is one of the few times i see tons of light and pastel colours and such dark skin and even tho it kinda clashes because of the huge contrast im not bothered at all by it it somehow works quite well so good job to that lolita
  tasteful cleavage  oh its you again and no we still dont allow cleavage in lolita you larping retard
  yikes at furry and yikes at ita even more yikes at furry whos human arms show so much make it all fur or none this looks extra ridiculous      i first thought she was one of those plastic surgery real life dolls girls that where a thing a little while ago but then i saw the next two picks also lols at the huge cleavage here then none here   now we know for sure she drew that on in photoshop angle can do a lot but unless she had surgery in between there is no way they look as round and big as in pic one and then as flat and the bodies even a bit loose in pic two      if she isnt shes still using those who are for the likes and views
  no jsks or ops that are made to measure by a brand that actually knows how to make more curvy clothes work better ive got above average breast but no where near this and i already notice skirts just make it looks bigger by separating chest and lower body so clearly whereas a well fitting dress makes it more one whole    of course that doesnt count for those dresses that look like a skirt with a different body on top they are pretty but you kinda loose the becoming one whole pro of those items
  i like the left swoop although i would have made her nose a bit less pointy but the right swoop is horrible its not even symmetrical who over swoops their face without adding the one thing humans are naturally drawn at for perfection and whats with the flowers on their forehead    sorry i love overdone swoops if they are nice they look like unhuman perfectionised magical creatures like kyoharis pictures but this is a mess    i dont even want to think about the outfits or whats left of them after all the filters
  stop defending this its not lolita its fairy kei at best and not even great fairy kei
  swoop  swoops    its not called swoop moron
  i was wondering if anyone would post this looks like a trans
  because they either have a shitty petti or none at all
  its amino the place of degenerates you have such a positive hope
  all those asspats on cof made me cringe she looks bad do we have so much itas or are there so much people sugarcoating who for some reason dont understand you can also just not react to horrible outfits if you dont want to be negative
  is this the ashleys from recess
  i think a centimetre of subtle cleavage on dresses like mary magdalenes fleur antoinette can look nice in a good coord same with that hinana queena rococo dress that has been released a few times now just because most itas screw up or people use it as an excuse to wear bad fitting clothes doesnt make the whole idea bad    i didnt say youre a slut for showing cleavage in general i said that if youre shirt is so low cut its half your breast deep thats slutty there is a lot of marge between showing cleavage and showing half your breast
  brands do it sometimes on stock photos because they want to show the print on the skirt then itas think they can do the pose to hide that they dont have a proper petticoat obviously that doesnt work but if they had any awareness of how stuff looked and noticed it didnt work they wouldnt be itas and dress decently in the first place
i stopped reading this thread for awhile because it just kinda devolved into people nitpicking and being mean but holy fuck these are some prime classic itas keep it coming
  this is weird and cool kind of editorial even
  how so it looks like trash she cant coord to save her live and the quality of the photo is bad the only thing at all interesting here is the background
christ can this girl please quit lolita already
  the people who hate it are always the snobs that knock every lolita dress thats ever inspired by fandom even when its burando they call it poorly constructed and ita just for having pokemon or disney characters or whatever the fuck on it even if its coorded well
  call me crazy but i think this has potential she needs a wig to cover up her fried hair lose the cardigan and change that horrific headpiece but its not a lost cause  is there drama associated with her because desu shes really pretty so i dont want her to give up
  she kept whining about people giving her concrit when she asked for it her hair is always garbage and she tried to defend wearing gumcovered shoes shes hopeless
  i think my brain blocked it out wow yikes this just hit ita level for me      yeah true 40lbs is probably closer its hard to tell if shes super fat or just top heavy cause her face is super cute and her skin is enviously clear i associate most fatties with gross skin      you sound like an incel larper
  oh a shame then id like to see her do better but theres no changing a shitty attitude
  i have an entire collection of bad holy lantern coords     itas and tasteless noobs swarm this print like flies to shit
  if i remember correctly she made another post after her first where she was really salty about getting concrit i think she might have even likened the concrit to bullying at any rate it was a classic example of why cant i just wear what i want to why are lolitas so mean
  that headpiece is brand but the lack of bangs makes it look bad also that underskirt doesnt go with that dress and she needs a petticoat the cardigan looks out of place and look how the shadows hit her face shes not pretty just mediocre
  but still we make it up when we say some dont like to give concrit because this happens somewhat regularly and is annoying as a reaction for trying to help nah cgl is just full of meanies instead
  the ita cryptid
  implying brands cant put out some fuglyass shit  theres literally a thread going on right now dedicated to ugly brand items lmao
  oh hey swoopchan waiting for someone to post wistywish so you can white knight her some more fucking faggot
    heh this brand was the first to model at the grand embassy and it was like the hosts were trying to get it out of the way as quickly as possible what an embarrassment
  isnt that j and isnt she like a scammer racist who like sells melanie martinez inspired lolita stuff she models on her boyfriend on depop and who tried to promote her boyfriends music when she got called out for saying racist stuff also isnt this the same girl who is blocked by cherrycheezy for art theft because she was retarded and reposted cherrys art without her permission     just need to make sure lol
  dear god how old is this hog and why does the dress look dusty is it a replica
  her face looks creepy in this pic but not all that old
  dont forget the worst part anon
  what in the ever loving hell is a schizoaffective
  probably the mirror is dirty which is why it looks dusty to you
next thread 
  i know its just that i dont hate the headpiece itself and dont think that is the problem here she just makes it look bad its just one of those very lacy rectangle headdresses that btssb/aatp releases all the time
hi diy said i should try it here i hope you guys can help me getting started    i want to make a bespoke leather jacket for myself this will be a longer project does anyone here know this craft or has done something with leather in the past    which leather should i use in your opinion price doesnt matter quality is most important to me i might be using calfskin    where should i start should i make a prototype with cloth first    are there any must have techniques or tools you can recommend
  well the handmade or the cosplay help thread might be your best bet for help
  i strongly recommend making prototypes first denim is a good option because you can get it in a heavy enough weight to sew with a good leather sewing machine i prefer using a needlefeed machine with a roller foot but thats because i do a lot of detailed work a walking foot cylinder bed machine might be a better choice for something like a jacket unless youre planning on doing a lot of inlays or decorative stitching if using anything thicker than about 1mm you might want to skive edges before sewing them together to reduce bulk reinforcement tape on critical seams if you are using something lightweight probably want to use that around the armscyes anyway you cant pin leather together because it leaves holes so use rubber cement yes that rubber cement put a thin coat on both pieces wait til it dries then stick them together can be easily cleaned off after sewing unless you are using suede or nubuck when placing your pattern pieces on the hide be very mindful of which direction the stretch goes on each of your pieces outline them with chalk before cutting so you are sure they are arranged in the best way possible
  stop replying to crossboarders who dont use the help threads jackass
  sorry for being helpful poopface
  youre not helpful youre encouraging crossboarder men to just come in here and kill threads
could be a leathercraft thread so ill entertain you    first off youll want to make several prototypes both standard cotton toilles just to get the pattern down and using more structured fabrics if youve never worked with leather before get ready to spend a lot of money it doesnt take kindly to mistakes    youll want to use either lamb goat or cow cow is going to be the most common and likely the cheapest lamb is very soft but also stretchy goat has basically no give and is the most dense   i cant tell you how much youll need or how thick hide youll want id say 1mm at absolute most most commonly youll find chrome tan hides which are fine for this type of project    leather doesnt repair itself in the same way that fabric does once you have a hole youre stuck with it instead of pinning use glue or light clamps i dont know what machine you have for sewing but if its a household one chances are it wont work very well try it on a scrap piece including double/triple layers as thats going to be present in your jacket if it doesnt stitch clean just do it by hand in that case youll probably want to premake holes and then look into seams that will work    theres also a shitload of other stuff such as use natural fibre thread rather than polyester will inevitably eat through your leather and cutting the pieces with a knife rather than scissors
  hey anon    i recommend you try and check out other diy forums and/or ask /diy/ to recommend you one
  men  did you just assume ops gender kys
  lmao kys for caring this much on an anon board
  they are joking
  retard
      to be fair anons joke wasnt even remotely funny or even substantial by any stretch of reason they could have written a dissertation on how their struggles with a forrest gump level iq have affected the way they spread butter on their toast and id feel my time was less wasted reading it     anyway op obviously check the help thread but if you can make a jacket yourself not out of leather then spend some time getting to know the material calfskin sounds like a good option for balancing quality with ease of use but in terms of expenses not the best to practice on unless you specifically ask your supplier for scraps or scarred pieces or other rejects for that purpose
didnt see one in the catalogue so lets do this questions you have that dont deserve a whole thread    mine is what hairspray do you use to style your wigs the wig im styling doesnt need anything intense or gravity defying but i do need it to hold while i go about my day also wondering what is the best way to wash it out im just styling the bangs and hoping to be able to restyle it for later uses my wig is from arda if that matters
the cosplay help thread works
  is there one that isnt auto saging i didnt see one
  what does the title mean
  questions that dont deserve their own thread     sorry i havent been on cgl in awhile last time i was a regular in here that acronym was a thing
  i like ellenet it brushes out really easy
  does it only need to be brushed out or do you need to use water/soap
  brushed out takes care of most of the spray dont brush it out over your clothes you will look like you are made of dandruff from the hairspray flakes  for multiple coats of heavy spray you will still need to wash at some point
  cool thanks anon
anyone knowns why plastic surgery general tread has been deleted had it open on my phone and after waking up it didnt want to update because deletion it was up yesterday and we had the tread multiple times before without issues if i recall correctly so i dont think its not allowed archive doesnt show too much unusual happened either    it was nice to talk about it with people who can relate with a similar view in fashion and appearance especially since changes affect how we look in lolita or cosplay for that matter and people not in to that have very little sense for the style
not sure if this deserves its own thread or not    how do you make a good cosplay of a character that doesnt not have any defining features persay unless that applies but looks like a typical person doesnt wear any crazy outfits or accessories    pic related even if i dont do end up doing him hes a perfect example usual outfit is just a business outfit of sorts and i dont know how the fuck anyone is supposed to recognize that im actually cosplaying if im just wearing a business outfit or something like that
  a group is about your only real option but if all of the characters are that nondistinctive nobodys going to recognize you still an example that ive done before is being rock from black lagoon alone nobody knows who the fuck i am paired with a revy and a dutch not a problem
  forgot pic but i was the guy in the middle same deal as your guy just a standard business outfit
  you cant really not without a friend who can cosplay one of the more distinct characters from the same series to put you into context or a distinctive prop see light yagami cosplayers the character himself has a generic design but a distinctive notebook    pic related
  could you imagine being this guys step dad and having to take him to cons
  honestly they dont even have to recognize me i just want it to be apparent im cosplaying somebody and arent a conattendee happening to be dressed well and wearing a wig like something like the following but less cringy    for fucks sake i had forgotten about trashy touma too  you guys dont think using a prop to help distinguish the character is bad then i thought that would be more of a sin i dont want my entire cosplay to ride on a prop but if its really not as bad as i thought maybe ill have a change of heart    again it doesnt have to be him ill do but pic related is the bestlooking solo cosplay i can find quick enough of him like its apparent its somebody even if not specifically who and i think the prop helps it isnt anything specific from the series dude just likes books but in my opinion it also doesnt ride on the props
  like not something like the following less cringy
anyone know where to get a quality version of golds jacket
  as long as the prop is solid and not something really shoddy looking i really like props in cosplay personally
what is a good material for metal pieces like armor and smooth plastic surfaces  i first thought of thermoplasts like worbla but its surface always looks kind of rough second thought was just coating and then polishing it kinda like pic related  thats a good idea what would be best thermoplast    what other options are there
im sure this has been asked plenty times before but    how much of the cosplay do i have to make myself for it to be considered cosplay what distinguishes a costume halloween or otherwise from a cosplay does none of that matter it seems theres blurred lines and i have a compulsive need to use the right terms but thats if there is a right and wrong time to call it one or the other
  sintra has a smooth surface although if you get it hot enough you can end up getting fingerprints in it and such it also doesnt stick to itself it needs to be glued but its much cheaper and you pretty much only need to sand the edges if you dont get any marks on the surface
  you should find an answer that sounds good to you theres no right answer because its a matter of personal opinion     what distinguishes a costume halloween or otherwise from a cosplay  when youre doing cosplay youre impersonating a precise character not just a generic figure like a monk or a fairy and theres also the play part you should talk and act like that character
           thank you will have a look what sintra is
how long before the convention do fanime panel submissions usually open up id like to have a full cast and plan before then but i wanna know roughly how much time i have
  metal everything else will always look not really metal unless its impossible to make properly from real metal like some extreme armours just use metal
  cosplay is a custom of a specific character each cosplay is a costume not each costume is a cosplay
  dont do this only consider this for small pieces with little detail like belt buckles and such metal working has a nearly infinitely steeper learning curve than working with foam and it is also incredibly more expensive and usually requires the building of a forge cosplay isnt as particular as something like the sca with what materials are used so just go with thermoplastic or foam there are plenty of ways to make it look as realistic as possible without resorting to using real metal
  couldnt one just use car vinyl wrap its even available in shiny chrome
im working on a cosplay where basically my clothes have jewels stuck on them in various places   im already stocking up on flatback rhinestones but how the hell do i attach them most of them dont have holes so sewing is out of the question fabric glue is always shitty for me and id rather not hot glue if i can help it  basically what are good strong adhesives for sticking plastic/metal to fabric
  pretty sure its because thats not really on topic for the board  while it is prevalent in lolita and cosplay its not as common as make up which can be tied to both and related to either whereas plastic surgery is not related just used in both sometimes make up is much more common too     not to mention i saw people talking about dental surgery and the likes fitness threads are disallowed for the same reason because dental stuff has nothing to do with lolita or cosplay it has to do with how people look and believe it or not this is not the board to discuss how people look that would be /fit/    if they werent deleted in the past its because there are new jannis most likely i saw the janni update site wide jannis can also be lazy as all hell at getting stuff deleted mods dont care unless something is really breaking rules
  sadly fabric glue
can i just use regular paintbrushes for facepaint or do i need something more specialized
  you can for details for allover application i suggest sponges
  thanks  i do use these things for regular application but need stuff for detailing
  thanks especially the last part i was mainly confused because altrough i get its a stretch it always seemed allowed having had multiple treads and follow up treads i really enjoyed being able to talk about it with people with a similar aesthetic perspective most /fit/ people wont get i kinda wanna do this but i fear it might not work with lolita kinda remarks as well as other lolitas do shame its not allowed /
the help thread is autosaging like the titanic so ill ask here too  i need the hat in pic related to complete a cosplay but i have little to no propmaking experience whatsoever im still inexperienced with the cosplay half of /cgl/ is there anyone good i can commission to craft it
  yeah i found it interesting too but i dont think 4chan is the place to talk about that stuff in general    there are loads of sites out there for that kind of discussion you even be anon on some of them
  im gonna disagree with the other two replies and say its possible but you need a prop you need something that blatantly shows what series you are from and you need to nail the accuracy of your wig and makeup dont overstyle it but get that shape just right if your character carries a particular item thats unique or if there is an inseries gag that is well known enough that you can make some kind of visual representation out of it a sign some kind of backdrop if you dont mind wearing that or maybe theres a mascot if your series has one and you can get a plush learn your characters body language and carry yourself with it poses and resting casually and all may be a bit larpy but if someone is a fan of the character you may pop out of a crowd to them at a glance    outside of that yeah a group is your best bet but its not impossible resign yourself that if you want good pics schedule with a photographer and pick a location that really represents your shows theme so that even online youll at least have a bit of uniqueness to your stuff itll set you apart from the closet cosplays of the same character
can i evenly bleach a garment from bright red to faded pink how
guess it was qtddtot but where can i find this prosthetic
  what prosthetic the horns you probably just have to make them and then liquid latex them to your forehead
  larp stores then paint them yourself
  a strong bleach solution will weaken the fibers of the fabric a weak bleach solution probably wont do an even job and will look shitty  so probably not unless youre willing to take a chance on it turning out bad
anyone know where i can find shoes like this
  did you ask the guy
  wrestling boots
is there any way to block listings by mrk showing up on lacemarket
  you cant block on lm unfortunately
what is the best way to add the red triangles i feel that painting them on would not look good so my options are to either sew red triangles on top of the white hem which makes me worry about fraying or line crispness or removing sections of white and replacing with red    im relatively new to sewing so forgive me if this is a stupid question i just want to make the best looking costume i can    thank you in advance for any help
  trust me you do not want to do option 3 unless you really really want to  i made one of those robes before and i cut out the triangles ironed on double sided adhesive forgot the name and ironed them onto the robe i didnt have to worry about fray check because the iron on sealed the edges but you can baste the triangles onto the robe and then satin stitch around the edges of you want a nice look it is time consuming a little but if you paint them with fabric paint it wont look bad
  a few months usually so probably feb/march 2019
  yeah but still an anon lolita plastic surgeon topic seems rare i guess i just sit here lonely again and only talk to close friends about it
i cant do an ahegao face    how do i fix this
i have 4c hair and ive been skating along on bare minimum my whole life due to disinterest in doing much with it/consistent difficulty with it my level of experience is basically nil i know how to hot comb though i have no patience and forget to put my hair up at night    then i got into lolita and aristo and my awful hair ruins any attempt at a good coord whats a decent style for someone with no experience and short 4c hair im thinking some type of braid but id need a bead to weigh it down enough that i dont look like a racist cartoon come to life and id have no idea what beads would look good    please gulls i dont want to be ita forever
  easy answer get a wig    if no then i think the hair styles on the far leftthe two buns or the large single bunwould look rly nice adding some clip on bangs might work too
  just dont apparently your biology is trying to save you a lifetime of regret
only tangentially related but ive been looking into making plush toys and im struggling to find any resources for generalpurpose skills like plenty of places sell patterns but im looking for something that would let me make my own patterns based on piecing together patterns for common simple shapes or something any idea if theres something like that
is there a way to fix a hole in the clear plastic of an ita bag im hoping for patching but i really like the base bag so i wouldnt be overly avoidant of replacing the whole plastic altogether
  they have stupid questions thread and help thread now
is it harder these days to gain a following just from cosplaying
i need guidance seagulls currently working on this wig but quickly learning that spikes are not my thing ive watched tutorials but my points end up looking flat and crunchy ive already brushed out the spikes and spray gunk twice now and i just dont know where to go from here any advice i just want it to at least be recognizable at this point
  tsk tsk you shouldve started with a long lacefront wig cut it down then style it it wouldve made the front area much easier to style and looks more natural
  funny enough when i bought this both epic and arda were sold out of the lacefronts i wanted so this is the 5 wits wig thats meant specifically for this character so i thought it wouldnt be too bad its thick and was long enough for styling but yeah the hairline is pretty meh thankfully headbands work for kirishima
  even if you melt new plastic in which takes skill itll leave an ugly spot best bet is to use a seam ripper to open up carefully and then replace the plastic and resew the bag
whats the bottom of this ballgown called
  the ruching
  yes is there a name for that style where its curved like that
anyone know where i can find black stilettos like futaba has its less finding the style and more finding them for a 21cm shoe size  i can paint then green no issue but holy shit i wish i had bigger feet
anyone have any good jewelry brands for gothic lolita
  e6000 or gemtac  dont use fabric glue like  says     ruching
/v here need answear for science 
  shit again  ive never worn a skintight suit but does the suit really go right up the crack like that just seems like it would be really uncomfortable
  fml here is the picture
  this in incredibly unrealistic
  i know that spine is boned im asking how skin suits cutting up your ass crack are
  well if its made out of fabric you could just pucker the seam  if its latex or vinyl or something less flexible like that youre going to have to make ass cheek pockets
  i think braids look really cool you could get simple black/red/blue ones for aristo or bowshaped pastel ones if youre into sweet    or like the other anon suggested just get a wig
  not by default unless you would do extra work to shape it to your ass normally it goes over it like a panty but tighter so it follows the curve but doesnt go in the crack
  should i just give up on cosplay if im black
  no but you will be held to much higher standards than white cosplayers its not fair and its not right but its how things are
how do you get a job as one of the vendors at an anime convention like not the artists but the actual vendors that sell figures and the like do you need to be located somewhere particular for a company to hire you
  if you mean how to work under a vendor its mostly connections some vendors recruit locals before the con though and usually have an ad on social media somewhere     if you mean get a spot in the exhibitor hall as an independent vendor then its either 1apply when cons open their applications or 2email the con to inquire whether they have space
sakura is one my favorite girls but shes not truly sakura to me without some windy representation what would be the best way to go about doing that without overpowering sakuras outfit
is there a term for cute professional/office clothes i have to work for a living but i want to be moe american office workers dress like shit and i have no good rolemodels but for my chinese cartoons
      if you dont actually need to be recognizeable then the only two major signs you need are your wig and your makeup the more unnatural you go with these two options the more obvious you are that youre styled for the camera and not inperson and the more obvious it will seem to the average congoer that youre way overdone for just attending a con    with wigs chose a shade thats brighter/more saturated than you actually need it looks less natural then even if your character has limp hair gel it down until it doesnt move in the wind trust me this looks unnatural as fuck in person and will be one of the most obvious signs youre styled as a character and not as yourself    second cake on the foundation and makeup were talking theatricallevels of caked on makeup at barest minimum youll want foundation that doesnt move throughout the con cant sweat it off  youre gonna want the works primer face paint sealer etc then youll want to colour in your eyebrows a shade darker than your wig outline your eyes with thick eyeliner look up wing shapes if you need enlongate or change your eye shape and your ref has their lips covered in foundation in order to look closer to their character all these things look good on camera but will look unnatural in person and people will pick up on that    at that point youll pretty much look like a fake person but if you want to take it further then circle lenses and new clothes will also help circle lenses already look unnatural but if you pick a colour thats a touch brighter than your characters eyes theyll be really noticeable in person as well for clothes definitely clean clothes is a start but you can also starch the shirt so it looks stiffer and less natural     i mean at that point you might still not be recogniseable unless you have a prop as people cant quite place which source youre from but youll definitely look like youre cosplaying something
  thats just a basic blouse and a black skirt you consider this cute
    a lot of ebay sellers tag it as korean office wear or korean office lady using that search term in google with get you a ton of images and sellers then you can reverse image search it through taobao to find it for cheaper    no real search terms for starting with taobao though you can start with something like womens blouse and then usually theres a few options to chose princess style or korean style    japan you can try looking for girly style but its very hitandmiss as it just means well girly
  cant find a better image chill anon ultimately all burando is just a dress and theres nothing basic about it when most office clothes are something they found in a ross nowadays many wear notyogapants and a fucking tshirt    thank you the koreansi see now
how bad is it to wear shitty trap/loli cosplays as a muscular dude i mean i know its already done everywhere for cheap laughs but i loved doing it once with a friend    now im thinking about getting other dresses and taking more photos to shitpost do you think i should get whatever dress or it is only fun for the current meta of memes for example hit or miss tiktok right now with idol dress etc    pls help me cope with my underlying homosexuality   nno homo
has anyone tried shapermint before ive seen a lot of ads for it lately and i want to upgrade to shapewear that isnt from walmart
    just to clarify thats not what actual korean office worker bees wear theyre actually every bit as boring as everywhere else    its just what most ebay or englishspeaking sellers that tag any fancy/cutesy clothes as korean office and theres enough of them that you can run searches for it and come up with that aesthetic thats why it doesnt work on taobao where the clothes actually come from or japanese sites
working on props on painting phase but its really rushed because i just realized i barely have any time to do them con on friday busy all of thursday on top of classes and theyre my first props    is it worth taking them to a con if its not really that good ie weakest part of the whole set
  cosplay touhous or madoka girls people will expect it
  touhou  nah not many people familiar with that in my country and dont know if mass produced cosplays for my size are even there  madoka girls  never liked that show desu dunno    maybe i should go for konosuba too many normalfags in events already cosplaying them so a shitty crossplay would be fun  i would love to do some kemono friends also that would be great i love it but dunno
does anyone know what happened to dejavudea i know she mentioned she was going to miss uploading one of her vlogs but then she just nuked herself off of social media it seems i feel a bit betrayed to see her suddenly ghost her entire fanbase but i really do hope shes alright
what is the best kind of fake blood to use on a cosplay i am trying to replicate pic related and im not 100 familiar with the tools of the trade when it comes to cosplay  i know to avoid corn syrup based ones but thats it
id like to 3d print one or two small parts for a prop i have the files already but have no idea where even to begin  i dont want to buy an entire 3d printer but also dont know what my options are for paying for one are there shops that will print just one small thing rather than largerscale product runs or am i better off looking for a workerspace or local hobbyist to work with  is it expensive i know its relatively costly but dont know if its a case where even something that can fit in the palm of my hand will be over 20
  checkout the dangerous ladies they do 3d printed commissions
  mfw mods delete a thread where someone essentially admitted to breaking the law so the fbi is unable to search it     smh mods youre dumb asf sometimes
thought this board would be the best to ask on where can i find those hentai style cow print bikinis especially ones that will fit an american woman and not just tiny japanese girls  any advice on finding the accessories ears tail cowbell collar would help too
how do people get invited to cons as guests is it a matter of asking your followers to request you send an email to guest relations
  a university near me allows the public to use their 3d printers you send in the file they tell you the cost you pay it and you can pick it up when they email you maybe theres something like that in your area
  well it varies do you want to be a paid guest or just a guest in name     some cons go for anyone who has a big enough social media following some cons only talk to various management and agencies and see what talent they can release
before i buy it does anyone have this tutorial that theyre willing to share just wanted to check

  enlighten us on how to ship a commissioned yugi wig
what is butthole inspection i keep seeing this term but i doubt anyone is showing off their taint unless theyre a paetreon stripper
  a really tired meme
  how do i make cat ears like this should i just buy them from taobao 
  get a box big enough for the whole wig on its stand rig it so the styrofoam head is attached to the bottom and wont move at all pin the shit out of the wig so it doesnt move from the head pad all empty spaces with crumpled newspaper or bubble wrap
  if youve never made ears before buying them is probably the way to go youll need a lot of practice to get a result that looks as good as your photo but if you do them yourself youll learn a new skill so its up to you
how much does it take for packages to be dispatched to a japanese address i was thinking about closet child or tokyo alice in particular a friend of mine is in japan but he stays only until 12/16 i was thinking about sending something to his house do you believe the package can make it in time if i buy it tomorrow
old one saged     sydney ozcc is this weekend share your plans  brisbane ozcc just happened thoughts feelings feel free to share photodumps  pax aus is coming up are you cosing what cosplays are you expecting to see
my plans for syd ozcc is to go to a mates place and get drunk cause fuck the line up is boring and i can have more fun elsewhere
seems steamkittens still travelling even with him not in a very good way kudos for him travelling though
looks like ebx is bringing a cosplay comp to pax aus details will probably pop up next week with the rest of the schedule but what do you all think
  wow thats kind of exciting to hear pax hasnt really had anything for cosplayers which is strange considering lots of people tend to bring out big builds for it  im interested to see the prize pool hopefully it runs on the saturday so i can check it out
thoughts on the overall ozcc winner
  i havent actually seen anything about it would anyone mind dumping photos/posting the winning costume
      couldnt see shit from the stream so any photos would be great
ive never been to a convention before but i finally decided to go to pax this year i was thinking about cosplaying for fun but i have absolutely no idea where to start also is anyone else going alone or with a group
  if it was anything like 2 years ago itll just be judge preference and no actual criteria for judging     from what friends told me sewing seems to be prioritised over everything which fucks armour cosplayers
  hey dude if youve never cosplayed before id suggest going with something simple or maybe even a meme cosplay what kind of stuff do you like its a little late to start anything serious i think especially if youre new to it     otherwise i think pax is the best con to be alone at i went alone for the first several years and i loved it because theres so much to look at and so many panels meaning i dont have to compromise with anyone it can be really overwhelming on the con floor though so look out if you have sensory issues but there are several dedicated quiet spaces around     panels are pretty good for meeting people too whether its in a line or after the panel itself just talking to the hosts ive found everyone to be super friendly     good luck
  i make armour and t is 100 easier and less technical than sewing with all the resources out there today builds just arent as impressive as they used to be     however it seems like hand embroidery is the new trend in the comp scene
  do you have an example of your armour because i sew by trade and unless youre making a lot of flat panels with little embellishment i disagree with your statement that armour is less technical i do also question you on solving some of the locomotion issues that are not apparent within sewn costumes vs armour costumesthat are often unwieldy and cumbersome    i do agree that resource wise armour builds did get easier but the resources for it are not even a fraction of sewing resources whether were counting availability of resources patterns advice mentoring services etc etc sewing is simply far more approachable then armour
given all the horror stories about cosplay photographers bein dicks or thinking with them is it worth trying to get into it ive mostly used my dslr for video purposes but looking for something to do for funsies on weekends or when im at a convention anyway that isnt as intensive as video production or will everyone just assume if im a 5/10 30 yr old guy that i too am an enormous creep
  you should be fine in theory as long as youre friendly and youre self aware there are photographers in the community that dont have the creep reputation     the downside is that unfortunately that kind of reputation gets people talking about you and gets people looking at your page which really sucks but its what happens far too much of the time     if youre doing it for fun and you want to get out and take some cool photos and meet some people though just make sure you think things through before you say/touch because there are also some cosplayers who will blow things way out of proportion ask permission before adjusting a costume piece or repositioning an arm and stuff like that as long as youre coming at this from a non creepy perspective you should be fine and i hope you have a lot of fun
  of course its the same within film hi i need to do x so it looks like y can i just move you/this from a to b or i need this mic to sit here just under your shirt/mic pack to sit under your dress are you able to do that for me its always about asking before moving and getting that trust between crew and the cast and photography should be the same and its sad to hear that some dont understand that
  unless you act like a creep that assumption wont fall on you ie trying to give underage girls/boys your phone number trying to isolate people into remote areas of the convention without their friends touching people without their consent     a lot of the con photographers are now hitting 30 years  and theyre pretty reputable 
  probably not    the cosplay community is full of whiny little snowflakes without a doubt someone will have a sook and then theyll bitch about you on 4chan no doubt
  if you build up a good relationship with most people you work with though there tends to be a bit of defense here when people try that if you deserve to be called out then youll get called out but genuinely nice people or noncreepers at the very least do get defended a lot of the time by their clients/friends
  at the end of the day youll probably be fine anyway though its like with cosplayers you worry about people not liking you or bitching about you or whatever and then in the end no one pays much attention to you and you just fly under the radar people youve worked with come back to you because you provided good pictures and you were easy to work with and you get to just keep doing your thing its hard to build a reputation good or bad without something major happening or a lot of time passing
reeeee stop having boyfriends you slags
whos ready for pax
does anyone know why __meki suddenly deleted everything off her instagram did something happen at bris ozcc
  she hasnt been involved with amuse recently from what i can tell
  does anyone care why __meki    fixed
  we dont anon its why we have girlfriends instead
  probably because she moved to a different state
  as a slight outsider this is true with most of the chicks i know who cosplay
    registration for the eb cosplay thing is open it closes on the 16th seems hasty and badly advertised but i might enter the parade portion im not good enough for the actual competition
how do i meet a qt cosplayer chick
  step 1 go up and question about their cosplay  step 2 show genuine interest if youre not genuine theyll be able to tell  step 3 ask if theyre part of any group you can follow/like  step 4 talk a bit more before you leave and never follow up with anything
  you dont you go on tinder find a good looking girl date her and then appeal to her vanity by making a costume for her and asking her to come along    you really dont want a normal cosplayer to date if theyre anyone with a page theyre either in long term relationships or a sociopath
  hate to admit but  is pretty dead on most cute cosplay girls are used to getting attention and are going to be more picky with the people who approach them if they arent already in a relationship theres possibly a reason for that lol
    talk to pretty sweet cool chick on tinder for 6 months  could never find an opening to meetup beforehand but finally gonna have a good 3 days at pax  shes looking out of her current relationship with another girl and has started opening up to me more  i dont want to feel as if im manipulating her out and have all this bite me on the arse if we ever call it off  god help my social life    so asides that how are you guys holding up
  dont their hypergamous nature will only pick top guys and mostly arent apart of the community  they will use you as a beta cuck   aka you will be the emotional tampon to some other guy also side note never give money to them there is a reason why trash cosplay girls/ twitch thots are famous
  in a relationship  on tinder    yeah i somehow dont think shell need that much encouraging
a video exists of the guzzardi twins making out in their sora/roxas cosplays who remembers
  what the fuck they always seemed kind of weird to me honestly other than the fact that they usually go way too hard on the makeup costume construction is good though but yeah they seem pretty up themselves from all the fame they get    but yeah nah thats weird as fuck
  someone link it  there was always something weirdly incentous about them
  she was on tinder when i found her dropped it found a gf a couple months later a week ago shes starting to look out of it and now shes here talking to me    yea it was worded a bit weirdly
  oh god that was years ago right or did they do it again recently
  yeah it was back in like 2011 or so  real ogs  when dat was thicc
    tfw basically after they first met they sent pics to him of them making out in the bleach cosplays
  lol remember this psycho bitch who got herself banned from just about every event for clawing people
  always laugh at the first time i ever met her  be at flinders st  friend pulls out a 50 because we comparing how much we have or something  she spergs out where i come from you would be rolled for flashing that money  bitch was seriously fucked in the head her brothers chill as fuck though
  many female cosplayers seem to sperg out i wonder what it is that attracts people with aspergers to this hobby
  holy shit i had completely forgotten about her existence what is she even doing now     also it was the cringiest time of my life but i really miss the old melcospho/manifest days of melbourne cosplay its probably because i was young and didnt have any self awareness but i miss having fun with people in costume and not worrying that it was going to bite me in the ass later if i embarrassed myself and everyone seemed to be having more fun with it too
when did the secret cosplay trend start is it just a melbourne/australian thing or is this more widespread im sick of seeing posts in the mcc where people are either saying literally nothing about what theyre cosplaying and trying to get people to guess the surprise that no one cares about or i need help so unfortunately i have to reveal my secret cosplay     even with big name cosplayers does anyone give two shits about secret costumes
i heard one of the sydney lolitas died recently does anyone know what happened
i want to hold hands with andi
  its just the mcc being the mcc every time the admin posts i cringe so god damn hard makes me not want anything to do with the community
  some of the admins are alright but so many of them remind me of classic melbourne cosplay community of 20072012 and it also makes me cringe
  shes fet now not many friends still a psychotic bitch
  if youre referring to the memorial picnic it was that a memorial picnic she died ages ago
  i saw some pics from that she looked really young  do you know what happened
  im not sure i think it was a suicide
  fet
  yes fet wide tank
  new term to me strange one
  im surprised you havent heard of this one
  not going to lie i thought you meant she was a fetish model or something
whats everyone most looking forward to at pax
  making friends
    same just want some frens to talk about vidya games and have some fun
  good luck with that xd
any cosplay girls looking for a sugar daddy during pax
  this is what you look like to everyone here
  nah that guy gets more pussy
  this was tolerable a few months ago now you seriously need to smeg off
any anon here who knows what is going on with perth cosplay community i have been hearing that cosplayers around the age of 2029 are shaming people younger than them and or aged 30 and higher by posting about them in here or in instagram its scaring me off from trying to even enter the cosplay scene cause of this
    yes those 2011 or so days if social media was more big those days id be on weeb cringe complications
  dude who the fuck cares do what you want to do and dont let some stupid kids make you fear that how pathetic to lose time worrying about stupid peoples opinions
  one member from the group i look up to is posting in instagram saying nobody is perfect and that nobody has the right to tell others off while saying so she was telling how somebody who was 30 years of age cant be surrounded by cute things i support her good intentions but in the same paragraph that shes saying we cant judge other people she was clearly saying that a 30 year old cant be treated well and shouldnt hide behind plush toys i am scared that i would get judged when i start cosplaying i really am you cant tell me that i am not allowed to be scared
  this is the realest thing i live in fear of the videos my friends put on youtube in high school surfacing im not sure if i can laugh it off
  you can be scared but seriously youll regret letting fear hold you back from doing things you really want to get into soon youll be 40 50 60 and only look back and think  wow i wasnt actually old when i was 30 i should have got into cosplay so i would have had the last 10 20 30 years to enjoy it
  older cosplayer shaming  people shaming darkforce for dating girls at the very edge of underage which seems pretty fair hes nice and all but yikes
  the only people within our community who actively post here arent even cosplayers anymore they used to actively start and spread rumours here then run back to facebook to message people about what was going on to really make the fire burn theyve since gone pretty quiet and arent seen around cons anymore there may be a few others from the old waicon days still lurking around but theyre not worth the space they use    if you want to start cosplaying just do it head into a con and talk to people approach people and talk about the con/costumes/whatever youll find the vast majority are actually rather friendly      hah except you dont know the half of it you should see the messages hes been sending and how he treats people when they say no
  not much drama just avoid jefferey jones hes a scam artist and kinda rapey fetlife dom who sends kind of creepy messages to underage girls
  i suppose it seemed that way lets agree that shes a bitch with psychotic tendencies
  i want to know the reason behind that as well    he is annoying     it would be a random person stirring drama could be autistic
my hotline cosplay is basically done for fridaysunday besides a few bandages and little markings  alas i still feel a little nervous with the first time and all does anyone else get that feeling or am i just overthinking this shit
  its perfectly normal to be nervous before cosplaying for the first time itll all be fine though im sure just remember to bring your brain with you and youll have a great time
i didnt know what fetlife was before reading ausfag threads you degenerate bitches
  who is they  because this is the first i have heard of it is here from you 
  the vast majority are actually rather friendly  if youre a chick
  two best friends having a fight  they tell people around them  people pick sides    its a misunderstanding between best friends and its not going to destroy any coscomm the hoes who say so are stupid and are just stirring drama they really should just leave the two old friends to settle their differences not add more fuel to the fire and make those two fight more you dont need to worry about cosplaying whatever your age is you will always find people who will support you observe how they speak online and if you notice them always complaining about friends then best believe theyd end up complaining about you too you can easily spot people who are making up stories and looking for sympathy online dont let yourself be affected by it continue on supporting your favorite group just be careful of that member you specified
  that is true whenever me and my partner go to conventions she gets asked for photos all the time while i hold her bag on the side and we are both in cosplay
  100 so much easier difficulty
     the only people within our community who actively post here arent even cosplayers anymore oh anon you sweet summer child if you know the right people just listen to what they say theyll betray the fact they post here eventually
  even for photographers most are just thirsty mf just give them a camera and they would call themselves photographer even without proper education on how to use it       you must be a regular anon then its easy to find your own friends comments here but i wont assume since ive been across people who are quite skilled with copying how others talk
  are you a retard can you possibly find out whos posting here basing on some cue words get a life we all speak english and with the exception of those retards like you who intentionally makes the wrong grammar just to blame it on another nonenglish speaker    summer child  god youre a retard you are one of those anons who derails everything
that creepy dance mum at it again pushing her kid at togs and the community in general is anyone else finding it really uncomfortable
  cant be more vague there anon you are only stirring more drama you can shut up now dont include the whole community with your own salt spergs everywhere
    whoever you are i love you please marry me
jazmin literally no one believes you
  im allowed to disagree with you im sorry if its derwiling but im just expressing that youre wrong
  to answer this in a bit more detail its easy to tell who posts by what they talk about when cgl is brought up in conversation they seem to be too interested in what you feel about certain posts    im not talking a few questions here it becomes obvious they started drama and want to see their work best example i can give you is shiiva last year she was here all over the shop in normal conversation shed never let it go
  you know the one child whose photos keep popping up goes with the colours purple and orange further reinforcing how this has all become competition and not at all for fun 
  has 70 photos of her posted up and still complains rj eres not enough of her and other kids while photogs are scrutinised for taking photos of kids because of the litigation whatever happened to kids having fun and not worried about being photographed the mum is such an entitled cunt and using her kid to grab attention for herself
  not op but if youre in any of the fb australia cosplay groups youll know who this is always pops up onto my timeline          agree she posts her kid almost every few days whining about how her kid doesnt get attention its particularly alarming considering that the cosplay community can be incredibly toxic and is not at all a good place to raise a kid into
  you are allowed to do so   most anon who post salt and insult others here are the ones with great victim playing skills when confronted people who appear interested in the talk may have very well been just interested
  such a shit parent poor kid ill have problems growing up
  will
alright which one of you dressed in yellow came up to jacket on friday and unironically used the word shill in conversation when talking about mask reccomendations i found that fairly hilarious
anyone got a pax photo dump i didnt get to take any on the sat    there was a really great monster hunter cosplay and some solid dnd tiefling cosplays on the saturday
any of yas cop an eyefull of that big bowsette oy gevalt
  i gotchu senpai
any decent gash this weekend
did anyone here get a good panorama of the smash ultimate spread at pax
  i saw a couple of chubby upskirts at pax does that count
hugging someone is sexual assault now   i dont go for hugs but thats crazy
  also does anyone notice the people who shout out cosplay is not consent are all generally ugly lol
is katyuska escorting in japan again whats her escort name
  just curious why would she need to escort she makes a fuckton from patreon and has a fiancée
  because she wouldnt be the first cosplay escort she already posts nudes and it makes a shit ton of money and feeds her travel habit
  nudes and travelling doesnt equate to sex work though since most people do these two things sex work equates to sex work
  the hover hand is finally in style  i always knew i was a trend setter
im going to say it here anonymously because i cant hold it in anymore theres one girl in the perth cosplay community who when she posts a new progress pic or photo spams it to all the cosplay groups its annoying as shit because im part of many of them and i have to see her photos come up again and again and again because shes so hungry for fame and increasing her numbers its becoming almost intolerable and i dont care if she has thousands of likes now she gotta stop with that spam
  right click her post then hit snooze this lets you not see her shit without blocking her
  try being from melbourne theres at least a dozen that spam their new pictures and wips to every single group men and women
ok i gotta vent as well how does xeno_morphine do it 3 years ago this chick is doing emo goth shit then changes to kawaii shit and shes got only 25k insta but somehow gets to hang out with the 6 doki doki staff members and  supposedly  got a job offer on her first trip there like the girl is on welfare from what i can see reeks of damaged goods does zero promotional work for her feed and yet this shit happensdoes she even speak japanese or is this some bodyline tier waifu thing yes im jelly
  shes probably just actually attractive
  well firstly shes gorgeous and her aesthetic is cute as heck shes battled a lot of shit in her life and shes doing really well second of all she gets to hang with these people because her aunt has connections shes a sweet girl
  shes actually the most attention seeking person perth has right now i hate her
    does she escort
  probably because her aesthetic is on point and shes tall thin white girl maybe try an eating disorder like she did and you can get invited too
  are we talking about the same girl what are her initials
  shes a small cute white girl that was born in asia dont you know how low that makes the difficulty setting go for this kind of shit    nobody even cares about the overwhelming clusterfuck of the outfits and an uninstall attempt would definitely qualify you in the damaged goods category imo    on a tangent i feel genuinely sad for the people who have the same issues but dont get any support because theyre not perfect    god i hate this superficial af community
  lets just go with k
  looks like were talking about the same person then anon i really hate how smarmy and know it all she comes across as sounding too it doesnt help that most of her progress photos all look exactly the same like she cant fart without having to post an update about it
reminder that canberra exists and is the capital of australia  please visit some time
  what would you recommend coming to canberra for i have more free time to travel next year so i might come if theres something good on
  i havent seen her spamming in cosplayers wa to the point of not knowing who youre talking about what groups is she spamming
  just wait til she brings out another one of her tutorials youll see who im talking about
    gammacon passed already what else would people visit for
  canberra
    they are both successful in their crafts theres no reason for you to be bothered with them unless its directly concerning you
      never said she wasnt cute or i didnt like what she did i said i dont understand how she got where she has with apparently very little work while also having a broken vibe shes on the same level as every other cute girl i know who got involved with drugs and suicide and relies on the government for their weekly allowance but doesnt do anything to improve their life beyond posting skimpy pictures what makes her the exception i dont see her work for it     and she comes off distant irl not sure if thats her personality as a scared bunny introvert with anxiety or if shes an actual snob ive been to events where shes sat alone and ignored everyone for hours despite being spoken to and invited to join in and then the moment her friends show up shes all smiles and giggles if youre not going to interact with anyone why show up if she doesnt interact with anyone besides her own small group how is she so popular    what connections does her aunt have i think i remember hearing she does work with bands and shit      she was born in asia also if youre talking about a suicide attempt every batshit instagram thot has done one of those so im taking that off the table as damaged goods i mean she reeks of daddy issues and purposefully objectifies herself in order to seek validation of any kind and appears happy to mooch off the government without any ambition beyond being a pretty sex object guys can wank to      it concerns me the same way the world in general concerns me i dont think its fair some people can coast by in life on looks and family but if you have neither youre stuck working your ass off hoping to get to the same level as people who have done nothing to deserve it is that how the world works yes does it bother me yes
  well then maybe shes popular because many people think like you do you dont know it yet it is possible that most followers she has just wonder why she has connections not really on the supportive side
  even your big nerd store died like honestly you lot managed to fuck that up whats the point in a con
  indeed hk    and i feel you anon  the rules are fucked and the hordes of the stupid allow them to remain unchanged
theres a girl here i meet named elaine thats from australia neither of us really post as we told each other but i was browsing today i wonder if shell see this post
  also literally just back in the country already needs more attention
can people recommend some of their favorite aussie cosplayers i feel like despite being aussie i dont really follow many
  can we also talk about how her etsy store petticoats look nothing like what she has made before
  damaged goods  oh no a female cosplayer who is attractive has had sex before  thats really way too rare  here i thought that nobody had sex until they were 20
  tim souter such photographer much stud
  youre a spastic anon says cosplayers not photographers
  is he even photographing anymore he wasnt at pax
  thats because theyre not her petticoats theyre resold chinamade ones that she sews onto new waistbands thats what i heard off someone else
  shes said openly before its not cost effective for her to edge that many layers of tulle so she remakes from petticoats from china     i dont think theyre good petticoats
  astrokerrie   kibblekingcosplay   ataraxycreative   i_artemis_i  histoiri
  i dont think that buying two 15 cheap chinese fabric petticoats and sewing them into a new waistband constitutes as enough labour to sell for 100
      directly from her etsy description  overview  handmade item  sounds a lot like shes not openly saying that at all claiming these are handmade
  you watch if she ever posts progress photos of her petticoats theyll never be just loose fabric itll always be at an almost finished stage more than likely when shes unpicked the waistband and is about to resew it or the finished product theres nothing wrong with reselling stuff just dont lie to people that theyre all handmade while calling yourself something as self aggrandizing as queen of poof
told you she couldnt fart without having to update i wonder if shell make a post everytime someone buys one of her handmade petticoats
im going to leave this here enjoy anons
  i thought it was odd the fabric she used on her tutorials isnt the same as the products she sells 
  honestly if she was upfront about how she was doing this i wouldnt have an issue 30 of materials for two of those petticoats plus the time to unpick and stitch back together as a wage plus a retail markup because its a business and i understand this costing 100 and i would not be upset to purchase it knowing that because i am paying to not have to do it myself marketing it as the same as what she makes from scratch though annoys me
  on the other hand you could be k and youre just talking about yourself just to gain views and interest from random anons
      fucking based are there more guys who come along in cosplays like that and do they play vidya/drink together afterwards
  im here to tell you about this magical thing called interfacing im gods gift to earth for explaining the most basic part of clothing construction    she drives me up the wall
  next video im here to tell you about this cool new thing called cosplay    shes insufferable
  she didnt even explain how to do the interfacing properly in her video though    im here to tell you about stuff i only learnt about recently but i call myself a master at it now    her face scares me and i agree she is insufferable about it
  well what if the cosplayer knows and likes her angles whoever this cunt is shes probably an ugly cow who cant cosplay for shit as for the hug part no its not assault not even close glomping on the other hand is but no one does it these days       i know who youre talking bout now just a few keywords in cosplayer wa search button lol
hey guys i went to pax in melbourne recently and didnt get invited to any private hotel room parties or any of the private orgies so i had to spend my nights at bars and the awful pax afterparty    did anyone at pax melb end up attending any of the underground sex parties or is this place full of incels  prudes
  who the fuck is this wanker
thoughts on jusz cosplay
whos excited for brisnova    its my first interstate con alone  any tips gulls
  pretty good at what they do  down to see what new stuff theyll do next year
  make friends
  did you see her booette at pax
  do i want to
  modified used to mean problemsolving but now its a dirty word in cosplay because of misrepresentation and scams like this
  the con was full of bowsette booette and other super crown cosplayers
  dont know up to you i wasnt surprised she would go with the trend       yep was more of them on the sunday
    im also considering a trip to canberra that i could plan around a con if theyre decent ive been to quiet cons in melbourne and the atmosphere has always been awkward is it different in canberra because you dont have the contrast
  its awkward because you make it awkward do something bout that
how do you anons feel about a cosplayer who   is famous on instagram  always posts votes and polls on next cosplay   you vote   they never do it anyway
  do they have a patreon if they do theyre obliged to go with what their patrons want  alternatively they might be bluffing to mark territory if they have a large loyal fanbase smaller cosplayers wont want to step on their toes and so lose an opportunity to gain popularity its shitty but those big accounts do mobilise their followers to harass anyone they accuse of copying their ideas
did anyone get a chance to catch the brisbane odyssey leg im not at nova and was planning to watch the stream they said theyd do but obviously they didnt end up streaming
  i think they are just attention whores
  its on sunday anon
  its like the idiots who cosplay characters they dont nothing about but cosplay it anyway because trend
  im a dumb bitch who thought yesterday was sunday sorry about that all    anyway hows everyone been enjoying brisnova any stand out costumes
cosplay dash was a waste of time
  cosplayer all have a long list of things they want to cosplay    just because they dont do it instantly doesnt mean itll never happen    also polls are to increase engagement do you think these cosplayer actually care about you when they reply to your comments get over it anon   dont be so entitled
  large waves of cosplayer go with the trend earth chan bowserette 02 from darling in the fraanx     of course its not a surprise
  agreed my list is only about 10 at the moment but it will keep growing even if i ask someones opinion on what to do next im allowed to disregard it
  i didnt get to go because i had to work for 11 hours and i just moved recently and im broke as fuck    but i really liked this girl been following her on instagram put everything together she went big which is admirable
  you must ask a cosplayer if you want them to do something  gets offended by photographers asking if they want to do a particular angle or pose    nani
  shes probably ugly as fuck and just wants to speak out because mama bear    wonder whats shes been sniffing
  i feel that they only do those votes in order to use them as an excuse to do the slutty option without seeming like a slut  if the sluttier option doesnt get voted for then theyll just do it anyway but if it does then they can say that everyone voted for it to deflect claims of attention whoring and sluttiness
when you are trying to be a speed builder but you actually build just photoprop
  what a mess lol insta tag
  officialgothbarbie
  she killed herself
  what shoddy photoshop     i do hope thats her and not the photographer
  told you anons just brought out another basic bitch tutorial and already shared it to half a dozen groups    just watched it there was literally zero substance to that tutorial its like shes spouted the most basic facts and thrown in some buzzwords to make it sound like she knows whats up did anyone learn absolutely anything from it here
k is at it again
best and worst part of brisnova for me was taking a pretty belowaverage bowsette cosplayer back to the hotel and ramming her hard enough she shit herself
  whats her tutorial on now
  try to keep your posts based on reality anon no one here is interested in wet dreams
someones had some work done i wonder who paid for it
    how to alter patterns except theres no explanation on how to actually do that its just you can mix and match patterns to frankenstein your own and make a mock up suddenly cuts to finished product    theres no substantial learning potential in her tutorial whatsoever anyone whos ever used a store bought pattern would just watch it and go yeah duh
  who is she this looks great
  im pretty sure its just lip fillers maaybe a little filler on the tip of her nose as well but that could easily be photoshop and angles
  sorry gammacon is not worth the drive/flight to canberra ive been for the last 2 years and both were a waste of time sydney conventions make me remember why i still go to cons
  399 for a photo editing app
hey guls    is there any recourse i have for people spreading malicious rumours im lucky enough my reputation at this point cant really be hurt too much but im starting to get sick of it since this person is clearly unhinged and im tired of either meeting new people and having to say oh god not this again or even having my so deal with her harrassment over social media    despite a defamation lawsuit a lawyer told me ages ago unless i have 20k to waste and this person wont just file bankruptcy immediately that option is somewhat pointless
  what state are you in anon
  victoria
      this is probably the best any of us can do ianal but hopefully someone through that can help it sucks that someone contacts your so other cosplayers out of the blue and holds a grudge     hopefully if theyre as unhinged as you say people are giving you a chance and if not fuck em keep the people you love close anyone who has to resort to approaching people to try and spread their narrative constantly especially if they have no proof will get caught out and probably already has a few times which is pushing them onwards enjoy that you probably live in their head rent free digging away at them if they havent beat you yet you won clearly
  well anon what exactly are you seeking in terms of recourse do you want them to stop it or do you want money back what type of end result are you seeking         i dont know about the legislation and the nitty gritty of these orders in victoria but if theyre harrassing you in your every day life then you may need to get one of these     it is a long and arduous process especially if theyre likely to contest it you might want to get a lawyer involved who specialises in criminal matters     also start gathering up the evidence especially if theyre harrassing you and significant others in real life
  gather evidence get a lawyer or get over it
someone tell yeliz she is a hot arrogant mess wtf is those dancing videos
  she does dancing now
  im lucky enough my reputation at this point cant really be hurt    weird flex but okay
  whos the cosplayer
  he was holidaying in japan around pax time
  multicultural festival folk festival just check the calendar they have lots on throughout the year and a lot of good live music and cafes
  and their art gallery has exhibitions other cities dont get
  thats pretty cool
  who cares
  bold you to assume anyone on 4chan has ever had sex at all
  cmon its cgl we nosey as fuc here
  she dances on her socials showing herself of  i remember once she said she couldnt take videos or pictures at any other ankle because of her knee funny as
ardella trying to pretend shes still relevant
  this looks good though
  should have edited those stray hairs and threads but not bad at all
  im pretty sure steamkittens doesnt let anyone else edit the photos they take
i know for a fact that the only reason k from perth has so many page likes is because she buys them and she spends money out the nose promoting every post she uploads including her tutorials
  her mum is rich as fuck thats about it
  reminds me of silhouette damore  does goth shit then does cute shit when it gets mainstream like her booette havent seen much photos from it mustve been shit tier
      oh no two girls grew out of their emo/goth phases how unheard of     hahaha my my arent you the edgiest gul here
  if i had the choice between my mum indulging me or helping with my hecs fees id go with hecs international efame sounds great but its a break from reality
  true the few times ive been the galleries are worth the trip
  how did you pick up at a con anon the rest of us incels here need tips
  chloroform
  go neck yourself
onesnapman takes cosplay photos but doesnt edit because hes lazy then why bother taking up photography onecrapman    and what a dumb name onesnapman
  why mad
  she had a photoshoot how is that trying to be relevant did she send the photo to your mailbox
  decided to lurk  her public socials only have her cosplay work     dunn see how that classifies as exclusively cute shit as ur implying _ツ_/
  i was hoping for sum tea    you disappoint me anon
  
  how does anyone else get likes these days the algorithm sucks if you dont promote your posts i dont care much for her content but i dont blame her for resorting to paying
i wonder how many more posts were going to see every time she sells another handmade petticoat
  anon is just jealous that an older cosplayers jester is cuter than theirs could ever be
why are there no lolitas in brisbane i just want to see one of you fucking nerds for once
  ty
  all the lolitas have disappeared because of this shitty weather lately brisbane needs to chill
  do you guys just walk around queen street or something i never have seen any of you
  haha she is like 15 not even lying she is really good to be honest
  ive seen like on lolita and thats it its because theres not enough meetups that are organised lol plus i need a new outfit before i burn to death in this heat
  i think shes about 1617 shes a little cutie and pretty damn good
  she got the good genetics ive talked to her a couple of times and she is literally all natural its hard to believe that someone can actually look like that without sugery
  jelly
  goddamn shes so cute
  i just want to cuddle her and buy her bubble tea
          samefag much
  yeah those are embarrassingly samefags come on girl your store bought cosplay is fine but dont self post and compliment yourself on /cgl/ps cut your wig next time leaving the bang hanging in front of your eyes like that looks bad
  not really
  fuck forgot screencap
  if shes under 18 shes not allowed to post
  no its not samefag idiot i dont even know the girl but shes super cute and im trying to spread positivity
            samefag when five replies about a pic posted 9 days ago and well up in the thread   also can we not talk about underage people on cgl especially not if you want to cuddle her
  its a same fag even if proof is posted its not a same fag because i say so    you reek of jealousy
  anon i was saying she shouldnt post i happened to post less than a minute after and that was because i thought it ought to end
sa ge
  there are just all elitist _
  sorry to break it to ya but she doesnt go on 4chan its not same fag but hey believe what you want to believe btw if you want me to tell her things just reply to me
  tell her shes as cute as a button and i want to date her
  sounds like something someone same fagging would say
  agreed also shes not pretty at all if she doesnt go here no point commenting here go to her instagram and support her there samefags selfposting all the time
any melbourne lolitas know whats going on comm wise because the only comm ive been able to find other than that fashion walk is dead af and i cant join anyway because i dont have facebook
  i dont think shes ugly and she looks like stock standard instagram kawaii girl cosplayer but ya this thread reeks of selfpromo    something on topic thoughts about sydney madfest
  if madfest sydney goes well in terms of organising and whatever else smash staff would need to be worried especially with how the con was handled last year
  smash staff would need to be worried  cons arent mutually exclusive the people who go to 1 genre of convention go to the other    now rtx thats a con that needs to go bankrupt
  its pretty much dead and buried in melb even for the subgroups so i just hang with friends who actually want to keep wearing lolita the hfw is still being run by rosie desu i dont want to associate with that trouble
  rtx is off next year instead rooster teeth are doing 3 achievement hunter live shows in different cities
  rosie  yikes
  good riddance
    whos rosie and whats so bad about her i was thinking of going to the next fashion walk just to show up all the itas and because its the only thing on
  tldr she was booted from the melb comm due to debt to another member bullied the original hfw organiser out of the position afaik she also admins the hf community and didnt want to associate with our crowd from the lolita community when they offered to extend the invitation for their last swap meet
  damn that sucks
ive been lurking /cgl/ for a few months now but forgive me if my kind of cosplay isnt welcome here    booted from a group due to money and debt problems and screwing around with other disjointed members/organisers and hence ends up commanding/forming her own group out of presumed spite or mockery    this sounds a lot like this one bloke us ww reenactors had to bloody deal with what is it with these sorts of people and why do they think theyre top shit
hey guys ive been ironically cosplaying by myself using a homemade greenscreen setup for 2 years because im hella autistic ive never actually been to a con before or even have any friends who go to that kinda stuff    wheres a good entry point i can go to to meet people and make friends thats not fully saturated with drama and cringe  i live in sydney btw
  what do you think about that other k cosplayer who posted her photo today shes implying that people know her
  shes cute af and does a good job as admin let her enjoy things you bitter ass i dont think her post implied that people should know her just that they might have seen her in that cosplay at a previous con plus the fabric choices and prop work looked solid
  tf did i miss out on this is so overly vague i dont understand
  good luck if youre insecure you arent going to find a con which wood suit your needs over there go back to your safe space
  i think she is hungry for attention she had been contacting all new cosplayers in sight with hopes of fitting in dont get fooled new cosplayers this lady destroyed many of perths events
  wood  how about you go back to primary school
can someone post some actual content  or lacking that some actual drama
  bringing up waicon drama   inaccurately   dead horsejpg
      why is the level of toxicity higher in cosplay and then even more concentrated among lolitas
  thats really unfortunate i just moved to melbourne and was hoping there might be a fb group or something
  are there any other animefocussed cons here
  and you know the real story cause you are part of the group who stole from them
  madfest is the main one now they come to perth       yawn we all know runkies ran off with the money stop acting like anyone else had anything to do with it
so the australian game awards nominations are out and has a category for cosplayer of the year  nominees include  wirru  beke  henchwench  infamous laura   yeliz  variable    as well as a bunch of names never heard before  oh boy
  there is a fb group but no one has organised anything for ild and the last meet was july
  because cosplay and lolita is about making yourself look good and that attracts a lot of vain shallow and narcissistic people who are the type of people that cause drama
  yeliz for what sticking her ass out being super arrogant getting help on costumes and not crediting people striving only to be famous and thinking shes an int cosplay er when she visits one country ok
  lmfao how is variable still relevant did she get all her white knights to nominate her
someone should really make a new melbourne comm id do it if i could but i cant for at least the next 6 months unless someone is willing and able to cofound
  why melbourne will still have the same people in it
    whats the point of making a second comm nobodys going to host events for
  how is this bitch still relevant comment also relevant to infamous laura
  wow thats surprising theres better cosplayers than her and wonder how she will react when she doesnt win
  variable probably got in there by threatening the judges of a possible sexual harassment case she made up
  what a fucking joke id like to know what the criteria was for this who sucks the most dick
  looks like tim vega from melbourne cosplay comm went online and nominated all his senpais
  not insecure and safe spaces are for communists and gypsys but my main interaction with the cosplay community is occasionally lurking this board so everything ive read is about drama and useless    ive heard of smash and supanova and comiccon but theyve already past this year and i wanna try make friends before i wonder around a convention hall awkwardly dressed as the bridge from bridge to terabithia by myself
  hes one of the good ones honestly
  who cheats on the most people too
    the whole event is quite literally just a scam for peoples money the guy has been super smart with the idea of it but went about it in the most backwards way they are selling tickets for fans for almost 200 bucks and get access to a special meet and greet which im assuming involves nominees but most of them/if not all of them havent even been contacted by the event saying they are nominated let alone using their names and following to sell tickets its gross    if you go through the categories it looks so unprofessional half the people have hq pictures the others barely have their logo there is even a few with the back of peoples heads lmao if youre involved with esports too you can notice a trend of most people nominated work for/ or are close with the creator which is very thinking emoji     also variable people up for cosplayer of the year makes me laugh like who in their right mind    the whole thing will obviously be super successful because the moment people see they are up for an award they havent bothered looking into it and have just told their followers to go vote gaining the website and event traffic and selling those ridiculously priced tickets im just sad they went about it so snakey  this is so long wow apologies     tldr stealing peoples money to attend and exploiting peoples names i guess 
  it seems they just chose aussie cosplayers with the biggest followers on instagram great marketing strat desu
  when variable gets nominated on the back of her oldass career and hasnt brought out anything new for god knows how long while amazing craftmanship cosplayers like major sam dont even get nominated    a list that includes will whose craftmanship is average at best as well as a bunch of costhots who prefer ta over craftmanship yeah this whole event is a cashgrab using popularity and nothing more
  are we not gonna mention the harley quinn cosplayer is nominated  who literally doesnt make any of her costumes herself
  honestly theres probably two people in there worthy of the award cosplay chris and astrokerrie seem to have invested time making costumes and working in the games industry with these companies this is meant to be a video games awards night right half these kids have barely dipped their toes into the video game industry
its really shitty cause one of my mates was nominated and they make excellent stuff they take months making it they werent informed at all and now theyre feeling like crap cause of negative comments saying they dont deserve it when they never even realized they were nominated its really unethical just nominating people without even asking or having them apply for it     also fuck variable getting on that list that lying cunt
  most of the nominees didnt even know about it / didnt want to be thrown into this popularity contest only to be shit talked about
  if youre variable you deserve this for the way youve treated people for a long time
  fuck off yeliz
  i have literally never heard of cosplay chris
stop doing dva cosplays you thots
see they should have chosen jjcosplay18 for cosplayer of the year
  adding to this stop doing assassins creed cosplays
  i had to insta search who this person is hahaha oh dear
  nah man twoswordscosplay for cosplayer of the year he lets everyone know he is famous and a world class cosplayer because he competed in nationals whenever he can i think he recently tricked a small convention into having him as a cosplay special guest as well
  thats big talk for someone with 42 followers hahaha
shes always so so negative all the time its exhausting always complaining non stop about how shes being harassed bullied or doxxed hasnt released new costumes in forever and only updates no filter selfies and boob selfies with obvious meitu and circle lenses i would want someone this mediocre and drama filled being called cosplayer of the year
  my god he cant even spell the damn character hes cosplayed correctly he completely desecrated the lich king like i think that costume makes that awful crash bandicoot from a few months ago look like a masterpiece     seriously though what is up with these its my first ever costume/build people entering high level costume comps and making it into the competition yet they look like a dogs breakfast that has been shat out
  only one nomination was needed to be considered   apparently they selected pg cosplayers  um sure  and on top of that its not about who has the best work its a popularity contest  oh and varia is only there because shes friends with the people running the scam uh i mean awards  its a fucking mess
i just cant with jjcosplay18 anymore
  he and infamous harley were dating at one point
  who
  try hard brisbane guy who only ever does characters he thinks will make him look badass except they dont but to his credit has worked out a way to get the women onside by presenting them with attention and photographs
cosplay is a degenerate hobby and is just a way for thots to fuel their need for attention while pretending its not because men want to fuck them    prove me wrong
jjcosplay18 is such a creepy guyi saw him at a con make a girl so uncomfortable onceshe ran away from himbut on social mediapeople treat him like his normal very strange
  how when thats correct    read my above post
  the comps are such a joke these days i think they need better prizes and better vetting of costumes bad quality should just be booted out
  i cant believe he offers commissions
  odyssey is putting championships to shame with their prizes   hey you won this category in our national comp heres a laminated certificate and maybe a medal if you are lucky thanks sport  vs  hey you didnt win the major 1000 prize but heres a 250 prize from our sponsor
  this is why im entering oddesey instead of champions now
    ive been out of the loop for a while whats oddysey
  i tend to not care what people think i dont think i have any problems at least none that i hear about    but a few years ago i had someone try to destroy me and out me from the group i was in i had never even heard this persons name before not seen them online so i dont know how they would even know about me to try and do that also it was another photographer using that world loosely and not a cosplayer    ive had a friend from the community bad mouth me a lot i overheard them bad mouthing me to my house mates when i let them live at my place for free i literally had no idea until i overheard them they would have continued to do that at least for a while after i cut off our friendship and kicked out her    some people who you think may be friends will also just see you as a commodity whether they realise it themselves or not    you may get lucky or unlucky in some cases theres just no avoiding it thats just how it is in the community
  ive had people defend me only for the attacker to claim it was me pretending to be other people    actually theres even cases of someone saying how awful x person is and then someone claiming of this must be anon only he would have a problem with her
  fucking run the other way    unless you hate yourself
  awful i was with the one no longer with the one life doesnt have that spark anymore getting laid doesnt have that spark i spend all my time outside of cons/shoots alone and on my own
  5/10 30 yr old guy isnt that what most photographers look like anyway youf fit right in      in all seriousness though if you can deal with the backlash of not getting content out on top having cosplayers dick you around people not willing to pay you for your work or edit/layer filters over your work then youre looking at the right industry    just dont be a fucking creep and youre set
  sorry but i want to photograph what looks aesthetic often that may be cute girls thats just the way it is photography is a visual art/medium these days theres a lot more stuff that isnt cute girls that is aesthetic or has value then there used to be a few years ago though so its not always that way
  doesnt matter good way for me to get photos of stuff i like
  sounds like my life right now anon  they moved on in like a week too
  ive been eating fast food for every meal for a few months now luckily i dont get fat but yeah    apart from part time work thats all i really have to do to go outside usually walk to go get some shitty food is the highlight i have to look forward to and of course its over in minutes
anyone know where to get 2 sided smooth eva foam
  now try that looking like a shit potato terrible in photos and you get someone who only leaves to work and buy groceries and says maybe 10 words a day
  and what makes it better this being the day of their glorious birth i think
  lumins workshop if the thickness you want isnt sold out
when people on mcc are complaining about lack of likes and followers on their instagram like their content isnt that good anyway
  what do you mean anon
gday everyone hows it crackalackin
is larme/girly fashion dead
it still lives in our hearts
larme was just the japanese version of twee
nah just not very popular
all the girls who are into it think theyre into gyaru instead
          i found it odd how it went from being so popular even with the western comm then died
  i still wear larme on my own  pink x black x white pretty much is what i do
  i love girly fashion but i dont like larme the magazine because of their nymphet stuff are recent issues better
  technically larme cant die its just girly fashion based off street looks so long as there are girls wearing clothing outside there will be larme as for pink x black frilly lacy outfits with garters and hearts thats an outdated look now in japan
  what is the new look in japan
  i think its slowing down on both ends east and west mainly i think its because larme is more about having an eye for combining different brands into a look rather then strictly relying on brands to give us looks it was originally just a fashion magazine after all with the larme look just being the consistantlythemed way the stylists paired pieces in that way i think it has a lot in common with otome in that otome had a few brands same as larme but mostly it was up to the wearer to make it happen this is why lolita probably keeps hanging on they have brands and designers driving / playing off what their customers are doing with the fashion to create new pieces that still thematically click with the original concept it sort of creates a loose sense of community and maybe thats not what larme had      it seems to be a bit of antifashion noncategory postpop with a touch of decora
  god risa looks so much more cute in larme than lolita
  it seems to be a bit of antifashion noncategory postpop with a touch of decora  could you post examples because ive never seen this anywhere
tfw youre not skinny and cute enough to pull off larme    at least i can enjoy how it looks on pretty girls its such a pleasant aesthetic
  agreeing with   there isnt anything remotely close to that popular atm and no the art students that look like if they rolled tru a crafting store dont count as decora
  me too anon i might be able to pull it off but it probably wouldnt make me feel as confident as lolita does but ive amassed a small collection of larme magazines just because i love looking at them my favorite is vol 20 for uh reasons
i love the style but i cant fit into any brand pieces tall for jfash in general and busty and fell in love with style i saw in the early issues of larme so it dying out doesnt make much of a difference for me i did notice that a lot of western stores completely dropped the larme influences which is disappointing for me f21 used to have a ton of pieces that worked for the style but theyre long gone im not really concerned about following japanese trends because we all look ridiculous to normies anyway so im just glad i got introduced to a style i love even if it had a limited shelf life i do regret that ill probably die without ever having anything from katie on my body however
  not really a new look but lots of black shapeless heavy return of vintage pic related is close with a few details   chokers dropping out in popularity   chunky platforms still in   lace is huge   florals are huge especially greyscale and florals on top of patterns like checkered or houndstooth   no silhouette looks aka super shapeless/baggy    hats are back hairbows are less popular    theres other trends going on too but i cant recall them clearly/havent paid much attention
  as others have said larme isnt dying out other styles are becoming more popular since its not as branddependent as other fashions you can work anything into it as long as it fits the larme aesthetic if you want the look so badly id suggest going to thrift shops
  oh i do alreadyit was just really convenient having that aesthetic be all over western stores it isnt a necessity for my wardrobe i also sew and remake pieces myself as well my post is kinda incoherent because it was early in the morning but i was just trying to say that the style i liked from larme got dropped a long time ago so vastly changing trends arent something that necessarily bothers me but i will miss some iconic brand pieces from that era
  both of their legs are kind of chubby
  i recently came back from japan and i found that due to the cooler weather trends went towards textures layering tartan and knit wear pic related is what trends i saw most common in osaka nagoya and kyoto photos are from wearjp website so more of your daytoday looks that people load up
  yeah can confirm vintage is big across all fashion spectrums here in japan harajuku is still pretty ecclectic though so i cant give a better update    oh yeah and waifish boys that dolled up and look cute enough to swallow whole are all of the the place lighter pastel pixycut hair fitted younger boy looking clothes ect not sure if its a gay thing though as the few i saw seemed to be paired with what looked like a boyfriend
  those long black cami paired over an oversized top or sweater is every other girl on the street at the moment
  first column  snapbacks ruin every outfit
larme never made much sense to me and the name is so weird why
  thats not the current trend though larme is just girly trendy clothing the november issue literally had 0 outfits with the pink and black combination
  neither of those are snapbacks
i still wear larme although its gutting that there isnt much of a community to participate it anymore    i honestly feel that one of the factors in it not being as popular as before is the lack of a more thriving second hand market as with lolita it really stopped me from buying new pieces as i realised that i couldnt do anything with them if they didnt fit
i went to japan in the beggining of may and stayed there for a month     mostly i saw larme related fashion items only in stores that sold girly stuff    i only saw girls wearing larme when they were working at those stores even in takeshita street harajuku and shinjuku    vintage loose stuff seemed to be the trend indeed
  what a gross and unnecessary comment
  peak normie
  i think part of it is also that a lot of people just dont buy the magazine in the west buying the magazine is just as expensive as buying a new top or skirt there used to be a lot more scans
  hideous      love this nice to see goth inspired looks coming back
  since its not as branddependent as other fashions you can work anything into it as long as it fits the larme aesthetic     this is the polar opposite of what larme threads on here said a couple years ago that is what really killed larme gatekeeping and treating it like lolita fashion
  and what did get scanned were the more editorial looks i got the magazine when the pink garter look was starting to fade and it was more diverse than the looks typically presented as larme in the west if you look at the lucky pack thread a lot of the larme brands like one spo eat me and ank rouge are still going strong
  they are still going strong because they didnt stick with that kinda style see ank rouge going all oversize hoodies with animu art pic related
    this is gross     i miss 2011
  the first larme threads years ago were back when there werent many options for offbrand and yes the stuff people posted here as possible offbrand larme was awful until about 201617 when western brands started churning out more stuff similar to larme magazine
  those arent inherently larme brands
  ntayrt but no brand is inherently a larme brand except for maybe mon lily
not my scans but ill post some current larme stuff if anyone wants a comparison between old issues and new     larme 036

  there were still people insisting in 2017 that you couldnt be larme without wearing western brands and being extremely rigid and making nitpick/crit threads
  larme 035
  i liked the crit threads but yeah some anons definitely took it too far especially with the body policing shit cant be larme if youre not petite asian but that was a minority there was a lot more acceptance for western brands than before
  can anyone do a rough translation for this tutorial i think i understand most of it except step 1

  where is this skirt from its super cute
  no most of the photo shoots in the last issue i bought made me feel uncomfortable they were so clearly going for an underage/nymphet look
  i still wear it a few points    firstly there were a couple of malicious lolitas/other jfashion substyle anons who maliciously shitposted in old threads to kill them because they thought the style wasnt jfashion and didnt want people talking about it here despite being based on a fashion magazine from japan so thats part of why it died on here if you were one of those people i hope a baby throws up beetroot on one of your dresses you are the worst    secondly the brands that are quintessentially larme  eatme ehyphen mon lily honey mi honey crayme honey cinnamon etc are all still putting out pretty similar stuff to three/four years ago and its still being featured in the magazine for me it was always the magazine as a gateway to find brands i loved and the brands are still putting out shit i love pic related some eatme from this a/w tartan has come back in again but that always happens in the winter    the west had a skewed view of larme as a style in the first place though the types of looks anon is posting from 35 and 36 have always been in the magazine and it never consisted entirely of pink/black coords and fetish stuff grey brown tiny florals blue and red always featured as well there were always seasonal trends that came back in and out like denim and gingham in the summer and tartan/check in the winter individual models had their specific styles and looks and editorials were often based around that as well monica nishi always had a way more edgy goth look for example
  but look at the lucky pack its got a cold shoulder dress black and pink and i think styled differently those clothes though not the sneakers and not together could work for larme the hair and makeup are big part of the fashion
ok moving on to larme 034 i like this better than the two other volumes i posted
  larme 034
  larme 034
  larme 034
  larme 034

  that cold shoulder dress is so awful though the massive collar looks really unbalanced with the cutouts

  larme 034
  larme 034
  yeah idk what anon youre replying to is talking about all of those brands are putting out the same style of thing they were a few years ago plus the new weird stuff in the last larme thread we had i think the biggest complaint was about the style feeling stale and samey actually    i think another big problem is that all of the most popular bloggers abandoned the style seemingly because it got popular and they didnt like not being unique anymore at around the same time they all dropped out with no one to replace them because the scene was really small and no one else produced as high quality content saramaris photos and stuff were gorgeous as was most of the stuff thew girls from petite dollies put out normally when that happens in a style someone else fills in the gap but that didnt happen in this case who are the big western larme bloggers these days i also hate to say it but theres no one cute who actively produces content either and thats important    there are no popular larme bloggers anymore and that makes me sad
  larme 034
  personally i want the one from one spo      petite dollies is actually still going though it looks like they produce a blog post a month it looks like theyve added more contributors too i didnt look at their instagram accounts to see how often they post there the fb groups are pretty dead though and honestly never really felt like they took off to begin with
  well saramari was told she didnt suit larme everyone was always debating if ruka was a boy or not chieko was called a bitch ok valid no one likes katie/capsulebunny is it really a wonder that all the popular bloggers left and no one wants to take their place
  why was chieko called a bitch i really liked her as a lolita
  none of them post on their instas anymore and i think alice is the only one who actually writes blogposts for them now i agree regarding the facebook groups i use fb for keeping in touch with distant family and keep it as free from personal shit as possible its the single worst platform for this kind of shit      i was guilty of of saying saramari had a kind of long face  although she suits bangs so shes already doing better than me im fairly certain the ruka shit was a weird vendetta or she was stirring up shit herself why doesnt anyone like capsulebunny or chieko again    but yeah youre right its not surprising just kinda sad in most fashions thered be a couple of people who were just bellow them whod naturally fill the spaces as they left but in larme there was an absolute gulf between the top tier contributors and everyone else it doesnt feel like no one wanted to take their place it was that there was no one good enough to
  monica nishi always had a way more edgy goth look  could you please post these i googled but didnt really see anything that matched what youre describing     but i gotta know what goth larme looks like
  saramari  i just followed her and it looks like she still posts regularly
  yeah lemme dig out my copies and ill post some quick shots for you they wont be very high quality though one of the segments is called monica nishi urban goth you might have some luck with that in the mean time       weirdly enough she just posted today but its been literally months and she sold a ton of her stuff a while back and is still getting rid of it
  okay gonna dump some goth stuff and some stuff i just like     vol16
  totally lied those are from 18    this is from 15
  same bitter girl segment
  more bitter
  i just like this one
  same spread
  okay found the monaca segment i was looking for its in 24
  these next two are a double spread from 28
  but look at the lucky pack its got a cold shoulder dress black and pink  dresses like that have been a thing even before larme even listen flavor did those and they are by no means larme besides that is just some bs the west made up to be a style its not a thing
  and thats all i can be bothered to take pics of in shitty lighting at 3am theres a section with monaca p44 issue 25 called sid and nancy if anyone wants that but its more punk inspired than goth     can also scan things in properly if people would like
  its not a thing    if girls are wearing it it is larme wasnt this just discussed above
  larme is more a way of styling current trends cold shoulder dresses arent unique to it the way cupcake petticoats are to lolita but they were popular when i was getting the magazine along with crop tops and fake fur
  be the first was certainly love
  exhibit a butthurt lolita or other style poster purposefully ruining the thread    this is why you got that dream dress scalper you deserved it for shitting up other peoples threads
  thanks anon bitter girl i love it
  from what ive been following id say the street fashion over in japan has been all about motorsport themes fire motifs and checkered finish flags and patterns sporty slightly edgy and dark and anything loose as per usual
  i still do my makeup like this  is it out dated
  someone doesnt think larme is a thing it must be a lolita    yikes anon what did lolitas do to you
  can you not read  or other style poster  a bunch of you admitted you ruin these threads on purpose in the feels and confessions threads    i think sweet looks like giant retarded toddlers but i have never once posted those hot opinions in a lolita thread because its derailing and shitposting and it contributes nothing no one who likes sweet cares to hear it i understand that not liking something doesnt mean i have to ruin it for other people
  i understand that not liking something doesnt mean i have to ruin it for other people    this is exactly what is wrong with online lolita communities
  youre welcome if youd like higher quality scans of anything let me know     but back to discussion of current larme trends like other anon doing the scan dumps im seeing a lot of vintage inspired stuff at the moment maihees kind of grandma aesthetic seems to be quite popular almost has a refined cultparty feel to it            these in particular     one thing ive always loved about larme is that it didnt just focus on the clothes there is a kind of lifestyle component to it as well for lack of a better term i loved seeing bloggers share their rooms makeup and trinkets and things and more editorial or aesthetic style photography not just outfit pics
  im not a huge fan of the vintage style in the latest volumes might be part of why i stopped buying it and just followed brand releases im really into melt the lady as of late
  yeah i personally always veered towards the pheromone fetish style stuff pink black and red makes up the majority of my wardrobe yeah same im loving honey cinnamon and eatmes most recent stuff as well atm    one staple im happy stuck around so long was floor length sheer skirts and i wont stop wearing them even when they go out of style same goes for the other stuff really    but the thing i like the most after that is the kind of tartan preppy look that gets featured a lot its a nice change for winter because the fabrics tend to be thicker and you can layer a bit more    i wanna check out bis as well actually but it seems a lot less popular so browsing scans is harder
  the other half of this page for posteritys sake
  i got the first volume of bis when it first came out but i didnt like it that much larme is called normie but bis was definitely normie with a slice of nice makeup the articles looked like they could have been interesting had my japanese been a lot more advanced     perhaps its better now it did take larme a few issues to get its groove too
  yes
i still wear larme but i dont have any social media presence because im self conscious of how i look in photos im a fan of eatmes recent stuff and milks not exclusively larme but its featured in the magazine     i always thought the wests interpretation of larme wasnt quite right it focused too much on the fetish aspect and was too cartoony and exaggerated if that makes sense capsulebunnys look is an example of this
  are you sure it was the gyaru who became larme not the other way around
larme discord is a bit inactive but open for new members  discordgg/xva78yr
  a bunch of you admitted  actually taking anything posted in the feels thread as the truth  oh newfags
  not that anon but regardless of what was said in some confessions thread there were indeed anons purposely shitting up some of the old larme threads considering how lolitas treat each other its not much of a stretch to think theyd be shitty in other threads as well
  this
  this is so cute reminds me a bit of early hottopic days but upgraded
  those things are all focused on style not lifestyle
  forever 21 kei this style would look cute on a white chick if there was less layers but it looks like the clothes are eating these girls alive
  floor length sheer skirts  can anyone think of a normie brand that has these rn i saw a cute one on mercari but i dont want to pay shipping from japan just for one item       considering how lolitas treat each other   its not much of a stretch to think theyd be shitty in other threads as well  how they theat each other irl or on cgl and other anon comms what makes you think shitposters wear lolita irl i mean if this board was cosplay and gyaru instead of cosplay and egl im sure larme threads would get just as much shit
  have you looked at any secondhand western sites
  i was talking about cgl lolitas because we are on cgl whether they wear the fashion irl or not is irrelevant lolita threads make up the majority of jfashion discussion on this board and theyre way cattier than any of the other jfashion threads so if some anon comes in with some low effort larme is normie rant then yeah im gonna roll my eyes and assume its bleed over from the lolita side     at least the shitposting in lolita threads is actually knowledge about brands and terminology its pretty obvious when someone comes into a larme thread just to be a dick and not because theyre interested in the fashion       also per your question try searching for tulle skirts instead of just sheer skirts sheer skirts in western skirts brings up a lot of completely sheer skirts that youre supposed to wear over a bodysuit as club wear which i dont think is he look youre going for ill look around
  whether they wear the fashion irl or not is irrelevant  are you serious then theyre not lolitas theyre just lolitaatheart shitposters who want to shit on lolitas and subsequently larme most of the shitposting isnt about brands its about weight and appearances its also easy for trolls and crossboarders to pick up terminology because of how many lolita threads there are      if you live in the us if you use unregistered sal small packet international shipping would be around the same cost as domestic priority mail the skirt shouldnt be very heavy
  i would assume they have at least a passing interest in lolita if theyre shitposting in those threads all the time the shit posters in the larme threads would eventually forget about it and leave i presume to go back to shitposting in lolita threads which literally never ends
  also no one on cgl actually wears the fashions they talk about this is old news
  in all seriousness how is larme not normie normie is not necessarily bad
  its normie in comparison to something like lolita but not so much so in comparison to the clothes most people actually wear in day to day life including japan it really depends on your perspective
  including japan  eeeh japanese people in metropolitan areas do dress similarly to larme though i agree that it depends on perspective would one consider preppy to be a normie way of dressing up what about instagram trends are those normie
  most people in urban areas in japan dress more like  posted which is similar to the average western style even in japan its not exactly common     instagram trends are thotty style obviously
   floor length sheer skirts  forever 21 charlotte russe hm etc have them in the spring  uniqlo club monacco kate spade have them now/recently
  rooms and food are style not lifestyle for real
previous thread   how is your local comm  what is your comm doing for halloween    vaguepost gossip vent let it all out
  op pic is adorable but it lacks the one sulky goth in a corner and huddle of three classics wearing the same 3f bonnet in another corner
    so like what happened at kumoricon exactly what was the shitshow i want the horrid details
  you already made a thread for this entire topic which reeks of vendetta stop already
any australian gulls know whats going on with the melbourne comm it seems pretty dead and i havent seen any news about a meet since joining six months ago
  anybody please post more comm pics like this sincerely a lonelita  also how is everybody in this photo wearing sweet they all kind of look the same
    everyones wearing ap and nothing looks older than 2013 i think decoration dream symphonia of birds glass bottle of tears circa 2012 2013    so my bet is its an old photo from an ap brand tea party might have even come from an official tea party report so people dont feel shy about reposting it    i wonder where those attendees are now if theyre still wearing lolita this looks like a jolly good time    the good news is you can probably get into one of those brand tea parties even as a lonelita reach out online to find others who are also going before you head there so youre not just sitting there alone by yourself not knowing what to do bring a selfie stick and you can easily fill your time taking a lot of selfies with everyone even if you dont know people
  yeah im a melbourne lonelita and i wanna join a comm but there doesnt look to be much going on /
  ntayrt but i didnt get to go could you say what happened i looked in the kumo thread but didnt see any kind of vendettas do you mean a different thread
  someone made a thread specifically whining about the tea party and how it wasnt good enough for them it got deleted because all they could do was echo two specific complaints about food and goody bags
  oh i always see those kind of complaints   i thought it was going to be interesting
for a sexond i was truly terrified
  whats up with all the anons lately that over comment on op photos
la is incapable of finding a venue other than this one commence the mods rushing in to wk and defend themselves
  im not from la but is it a nice venue at least    i couldnt be too mad if that was the case my comm has this favorite tea spot people love to go to constantly the price is reasonable the food is good and the decor is amazing for coord shots
  i dont know the venue or the la comm but i have been part of multiple comms and each one has an old reliable kind of tea house usually used for ild i dont think its so bad its kind of hard to find gorgeous venues like this
so maybe this is more suited to the stupid questions thread but i wanted to start planning my own meets to help take some of the planning load off of my comm leader ive only been in a comm for a few months but as someone who grew up in a family who loves entertaining and planning silly stuff like this i think i should be able to pull it off properly     a few questions  what are the best venues to keep an eye on are some places better for bringing your own food or is it easier to order outside catering are goodie bags a typical thing or is it just for bigger events the meet i want to plan would be for christmas would setting up a secret santa be a fun idea or would it flop in a smaller comm how far ahead should you start planning a meet i know most meets require an rsvp or you have to buy a ticket in advance but whats the easiest way to make sure people can commit to coming is there a sweet spot of time in advance to ask people about dates     ive planned tea parties before but never for lolitas let alone planning a whole meet any advice would be super helpful
  too bad this place is none of the above its usually around 40 dollars for a seating the food is 5/10 and its in the middle of a busy downtown area its nice enough looking on the inside but thats really all there is to it
  the venue holds a lot of people but the food and lighting isnt great this place runs out of food quick and doesnt replenish it
  to answer some of your questions     goodie bags are usually only for larger events but if its for christmas it could be suitable to your event    the secret santa sounds cute but you would definitely want to plan the event way ahead of time as a lot of girls would probably want to buy something cute online for their giftee     if the event is free you just have to hassle people and make sure they come send them a message a bit before the event confirming their attendance if the event is paid then set up tickets asap so you can get funds for planning goodie bags venue food etc since people are paying to go its much less likely theyll flake out keep the ticket price reasonable especially if you are newer to the comm expensive events get a ton of whining from girls id recommend maybe something 2040
  thank you so much anon this is so helpful i hope i can pull it off because i have a lot of cute ideas for future meets and i feel like if i can pull off a holiday meet i can do some smallercutesy ones
  i like the food but it really depends on what you get there if you dont like tea sandwiches you probably wont enjoy the basic tea service the harvest tea and the holiday tea have some good items
  i would say the best venues are places with aesthetic and good food i would recommend a not too high price since you already have a small comm better not take chances with a 60 ticket price also a place that will let you have a more private room you dont want to end up in a place that is very public and open and deal with constant gawking     you also want to post about the event as early as possible to get the hype going even if you dont have a set ticket price then open up the payments a month in advance so that people can get their paychecks in order its especially important around the holidays since people have to budget for all the gifts etc payment in advance is pretty much the only way to guarantee commitment make sure to let people know there is no refunds and they are responsible for reselling their spot    in my comm people try to make goodie bags for almost every meet which is really cute i say go for it especially for a christmas meet    secret santa is kind of hard to pull off without people being left out i suggest doing a white elephant instead that way only the people that brought gifts can participate and people can choose gifts that are more their aesthetic and even trade later my comm did this and it was a huge success everyone actually brought fantastic gifts and no one was disappointed     for your very first meet i would suggest recruiting a helper or cohost it does get a bit stressfull planning the costs activities goodie bags and finding info on venues and thats if you arent even bringing your own food someone to help plan goodie bag contents or help you set up before the meet would be nice and also a good bonding activity with another lolita
does anyone know where i can buy my ticket for the christmas tea party in montreal i cant find anything about it on the facebook page
  and the ita furry with cat ears my comm is pretty well dressed overall but for some reason every large event has at least one cateared ita its not always the same one either
  i dont know if cat ears are still ita theres a pattern for a pair of them in augusts ons
  the halloween happy pack from innocent world came with cat ears this year
  theyre wolf ears
  i dont have any advice that hasnt already been given but i want to let you know that this will be hugely appreciated by the comm leader im one myself and organising meets can be exhausting if im sick or unavailable they just dont happen nobody steps up hopefully others will follow your example too    i hope your meets go great
  imo cat ears arent inherently ita   if you are poorly dressed they dont match the theme or they are poor quality/western shit then yes they look bad     brands put out cute cat ears all the time misako wears them and i think they look really cute if you are wearing a cat dress vanilla chan dolly cat etc
im really interested in knowing random things about other peoples communities if anyone wants to take part feel free to take out questions if you dont want to answer them    how strict is member screening for your local comm do prospective new members have to fill out a questionnaire or do something beyond clicking join to join    do you let in itas in the hope that they improve or are they instantly rejected    do you have an age restriction    how many members in your comm how many are actually active    how often does your comm have meets    do you hold craft/baking/sewing meets    are meets organised by mods/comm leaders or does everyone take turns to host    do you have many casual meets or are they all special occasions or vice versa    how many years has your local comm been active     whats the most popular substyle in your comm    does your comm allow people to wear other closely related fashion to meetups otome jgoth or is it strictly lolita    does your comm have local trends that arent common elsewhere eg everyone has the same type of parasol same brand of shoes similar hair and makeup etc
  are there truly more or are your panties in such a bunch right now that youre actively noticing them more often    i saw the same thing in the op photo and i was about to share the same cropped image its funny anonchan    unrelated note my itty bitty comm needs winter activities  what are some of your favourite things to do in the winter anons
  ice skating can be fun if people want to wear something a little more casual     christmas markets are great especially if its a real oldschool looking one with individual little log cabins for shops/food fantastic fun and usually great photo material
  how strict is member screening for your local comm do prospective new members have to fill out a questionnaire or do something beyond clicking join to join  yes facebook has made this much easier in recent years though in the past our based mods sent each applicant a message with a couple brief questions what got you interested in lolita/how long have you been interested/what are some of your favorite styles to filter the sissies and spammers  do you have an age restriction  the comm doesnt unless the facebook tos counts but sometimes meets do if they involve alcohol  are meets organised by mods/comm leaders or does everyone take turns to host  mods/leaders dont hold the reins on this but theres definitely people who are more gogetter about planning stuff and the majority dont even bother trying to suggest anything    do you have many casual meets or are they all special occasions or vice versa  roughly even    does your comm allow people to wear other closely related fashion to meetups otome jgoth or is it strictly lolita  sometimes especially to casual meets or con tea parties for things like ild that are a ticketed limited admission event its generally strongly encouraged you both wear lolita and dont drag a spouse/so/kid who isnt into a spot an actual comm member could have had
  anon all of the big lolita brands consistently release animal ear headpieces it only gets ita when its like desu desu lets put this neon green striped socks with this burgandy dress and ofc im a neko nii so nekooo earss that are 5 bucks at the local con
  cheap/unmatching ears are going to cheapen an outfit too you could have the most beautiful black ap cat ears and when you pair them with a pink coord cheap tacky ears that look cheap fun fur or cheaply made things those are always bad
  ha you sure did have a problem with that question maybe you should try chilling out sometime
  brand piece is suddenly less in price value because it wasnt coordinate to an anons standards  yea ok    christ on a fucking cracker why does everyone on this board rely on the words cheap and tacky to describe everything
  what other words are you suggesting anon  do you honestly think that dollar bin accessories look good  if its made out of shitty pennyameter fabric and notions its going to look bad    same thing for illfitting pieces do you legitimately think a gold pair of shoes looks good if its the only gold in the whole coord or how about a blue bluse with no other blue represented you sound unimaginative and dull
  did you not read what i said how is something cheap just because it was not coordinated appropriately ap cat ears are still ap that aint cheap unless youre fucking like 10k anon    the original argument is that ap cat ears could look good if coordinated appropriately like matching the theme and/or color of the outfit  if cat ears are shoehorned into a coord they dont decrease in value magically ya numbskull    the only people who sound dull and like they are lacking in imagination are the anons who repeat the phrase cheap and tacky to no fucking end
  mods check join requests and dont approve obvious sissies etc anyone lolita is let in however ita theres an elite comm nearby that only sends invites to people that wear brand and has an age restriction but its not very active no age restriction hundreds of members i wish mods would cull because many are obviously not lolitas meets maybe once a month with 615 attendees typical 25 on ilds im guessing there are 5060 actual lolitas in the area and about 20 of them wear lolita semiregularly no craft meets in past few years mod organised a lot but its small enough that anyone can host pretty much by just asking if people want to go to x activity on y date most are food and an exhibition of some sort since we have a a lot of local museums not sure definitely more than six years over half sweet but we have quite a lot of gothic other jfashion okay but very rarely happens no local trends i can think of
  dreamed i saw chinese exchange student in jm at a vintage store and invited her to join local comm  attends one meet and looks obviously uncomfortable because of itas and annoying brolita  never shows up again  mfw woke up and realised this would probably happen irl if anyone new ever joined    that about sums up my comm
  aww did you miss your nap today anon  where did anyone say anything about monetary value cheap is an adjective even thousand dollar fur coats can /look/ cheap i shouldnt have to spoonfeed you this much but i think im a glutton for punishment  again what are you suggesting we use other than cheap and tacky
  aww did you miss your nap today anon  you sound disgusting    you havent spoonfed anything you legit mental midget keep parroting words you fucking parrot    what about   hideous   lame  doesnt work with  terrible   awful  poorly chosen  ill fitting  out of place    all that said if you got a pair of nice ap cat ears and there are cats on the print you get a pass from me but hey i dont offer samefaggy concrit like most anons so unless you actually have more than one kind of opinion this mentality probably isnt for you
  finally some answers     yeah some of those are pretty good and ill probably use them if i see something that doesnt just look like cheap trash     if some ita shows up looking like pic related even if theyre brand if her coord doesnt match guess what cheap as hell      related to the thread does anyone have problems with members of your comm always wanting to go back to the same two or three places a favourite mediocre cafe a tourist spot that youve seen a dozen times what do you do
  
    im not talking about nice animal ears here and the animal ears arent the only reason im calling them ita theyre ita because their main pieces are the worst that bodyline has to offer cheap aliexpress or downright milanoo theyre wearing plastic ebay twin tail wigs or their hair is fried to high hell and dyed green their shoes are ballerina flats or flip flops etc the crappy ebay cat ears are just the cherry on top there are several itas like this in my comm and they almost exclusively turn up for big events for some reason
  toronto
  not even the right continent sorry aside from the splinter comm this setup is standard for most comms ive seen    im surprised a city as big as toronto would have so few lolitas turning up to meets
  it was the hundreds of members who mostly dont wear lolita and dead meets that made me think of toronto anime north means that cosplayers join en masse every year we also have a good portion of goths to sweet ratio which is rare if youre not european
what is your comm mom like describe her without naming her if your comm had a family structure what would it be like
  funny enough shes one of the smallest in height and amongst the youngest almost mid twenties  shes very caring but very anxious she calls us my children as a jokehas hands that are warm to holdalways has some meds in her bagsome tissues shell glare daggers at any normie being rude and make sure everyone had a good time afterwards  also she brings freshly baked goods that her and her so made to some meets
  she sounds lovely
  loud and gregarious but also kind mid 30s good at wrangling a big group a lil ita sometimes but in a relatable way would lend you her blouse or petti and go without if something bad happened to yours       thats so nice glad you have a cool comm mom wish mine baked cookies
  a lil ita sometimes but in a relatable way  this is what i aspire to become some day
  im newer to my comm but our comm mom is sweet gentle and has best taste in music shes cool and im intimidated to talk to her unless i have to 10/10 love my comm mom
  yours sounds a lot like mine shes been into lolita for well over a decade always has something hilarious too say and hand makes all her own pieces she doesnt get a chance to come too meets much anymore i really miss her
  cheap doesnt mean doesnt match are you esl

  get out
  smell my butt maam
why does ild always attract itas my comm is like 99 ita free but if theres going to one at a meet it is ild without fail
  maybe because ild meets are typically hyped up so lurkers are more likely to notice and want to go
  because they see it like comic con rather than just a meet up
my comm sucks no one wants to spend more than 15 on meetings people confirm their presence and then cancel at the event day our last comm lider was an ita who wore replicas and hideous things and didnt bother to make reservations or sometimes even show up at the meetings that she was hosting she was also very nasty with some of the other girls in the community and when those girls pointed it out they were treated like they were just trying to bring drama to the comm on top of it when someone decides to hang out with only their lolita friends without the rest of the community they are called elitists and acused to divide the comm for the very same people who dont want to spend any money going out and cancel their presence in the last minute
  my comm is pretty big but most meets are usually only like 13 to 15 people showing up and sometimes if its a really good meet we get like 20  the fb group has something to 300 members tho and i never meet the same people twice which is fun but i get the sense that these girls treat ild like a holiday and it just so happens winter ild is a convenient way to smash all the holidays together   so id say about 50 or so girls show twice a year its been a blast all the times i went even tho it seems common place to bitch about the food but it really feels like a holiday get together where you get to see all your old cousins or something even in the summer
i find 80 of the people in my comm boring af
  lol
  that really sucks anon if you go out with your friends and someone that cancels regularly whines about it call them out     our comm luckily has a three strike rule people that drop without notifying the host 3 times get booted
  pdx
  we call them out no one cares  it would be very nice to have such a rule
  no but im impressed theres another comm facing the same issues
    same they seem really fake and onesided i prefer when there are smaller meets because the girls attending seem more genuine and sweet and shy
  ild is like ita and n00b debut day they see the holiday and the extravagant meets and think wow this is a perfect time to make my lolita debut i can be a real lolita its like a convention for them i see it more with winter ild but that may just be my comm
  canadian
  lol in our comm the food is all paid for before the event if someone drops out we divide up their food and take it to go their loss
  do you have a suggestion for a better venue
  late 20s been in the fashion for 5 or 6 years i believe short but slightly intimidating gives advice and helps you find the missing piece to your coord and will let you borrow even her expensive brand bags for an event if you ask her ahead of time
anyone else a little conflicted about the az winter ild coming up  yuletide would be a cool theme except its being run by l who is a really obnoxious sjw edgelord and i dont know if i want to pay 60 for halloweenmas not to mention its in tuscon again
  the same mediocre tea room every time    its not even the only one in the city the others have much larger selections of tea food and desserts i think they like it because its on the cheap side i go there because i like going to meets but i hate it and its embarrassing going there so many times a year
  summer ild is always in phoenix winter in tucson so its always fair tucson girls always drive up to phoenix so im not sure why youre bitching about driving to tucson when we always have carpools what about us who dont live in either city we still drive out to see both of you either plan your own meet or quit bitching or dont bother coming because no one wants to deal with your salty ass anyways
  its being run by 45 people not one    so then dont go or make your own meet itll weed out the broke people and casual itas
  that sounds nothing like pdx except for the hanging out with friends is elitist thing which is a common issue
  organise a meet and pick another venue unless only mods organise in your comm
  someone mentions az  its either i hate this comm theyre cheapskates who never do anything interesting and theyre all ita or  i hate this comm this meet is too expensive and its weird and i dont like whos running it and its far  every single time    plan your own shit then by all means
  l2read please    i dont have a problem with the price specifically but i dont know if it is worth it to pay 60 when the following is also in place  id have to drive from glendale anyway  it will likely be trying too hard to be edgy based on l running it itll be like halloween 20 and im not about to pay 60 for a meet weve already done this year    i just wanted to see if other people were having the same doubts as me but any time az is brought up the mods come here and scream at everyone until the thread is deleted i guess i shouldnt have expected anything different this time
  i did and no one came but a couple marked interested and going so i was sitting around waiting why embarrass myself again
  thats not us tho  ive paid literal hundreds to attend pdx meets before
  its cute how you think the mods are the only ones calling you out on this when the entire comm uses cgl id be surprised if h or c even responded to you based on the fact that all the responses are coherent and free of typos l isnt the only one running it but if youre concerned why dont you just ask for more details about whats being planned before you throw down on the money and time i think thats a reasonable request more reasonable than bitching to cgl about it as if thatll change anything
  how ive never seen a ticket exceed 65 con tea parties doesnt count since the con requires you to buy a badge
  do you even know what yuletide is if l wanted halloween 20 im sure she wouldnt have bothered to pick yuletide as a theme   and have you ever bothered planning a nicer meet before or talked to someone who has 9999 of the time ticket price covers the venue rental and food gift bags decorations and raffle items are paid out of pocket by hosts nicer venues and meals mean higher costs and higher ticket prices you should be happy there are people in your comm willing to shell out for meets hosted in venues with our own private space somewhere other then the same tiny overcrowded public tea house year after year
  not that anon but travel expenses play a big role into cost friend
  aww she sounds precious i wish my comm had a motherly figure of sorts we have a lady who tries to be but shes just very ita and annoying
    hey i feel uneasy about this thing    reeeeeeeeeeee whatthefuckiswrongwithyougoplanyourownmeetupwedontwantyoutherehowdareyouinsultourgloriousleadersyoureapoorfagehocantaffordorplanorwipeyourownass    never change az comm i dont know why id ever think i could have a legitimate complaint without people having an autistic seizure when they hear it
  its not an autistic seizure you just dont have very valid points sorry
  i do though and no one has come up with any counter arguements other than plan yer own meetup and well she isnt the only one planning it    both of which are invalid be abuse  1 we all know damn well of the drama that would ensue if someone were to plan an alternate meetup    2 l is the only one who seems to be posting regularly on the event and has all the updates     which by the way for the anon who said she wasnt trying to make yuletide edgy what the fuck do you even call these bizarre descriptions she gave for it
  anon who said she wasnt trying to make yuletide edgy what the fuck do you even call these bizarre descriptions she gave for it    again do you even know what yuletide is    as far as there being multiple hosts it looks like l just made the event page and didnt bother adding any additional hosts why not who knows but i actually talk to people in the comm instead of throwing pointless shade on cgl and getting upset when im called out
  i interact with the comm too    please read my initial comment where exactly was the shade thrown i said i was a little conflicted  and i only became upset when people lost their shit over something so small
  if anon paid hundreds of dollars to travel to pdx for a meet then their statement doesnt make any sense the meet could have been free but theyd still have to pay that travel expense so i dont see why theyd post that as a rebuttal
  please reread your own comment you insulted the host complain about the theme and complain about the location people respond if you dont like the theme host or location then host your own meet and gave you a breakdown of what ticketed events pay for and what the hosts pay for sorry youre an idiot
  ah i was interpreting that as you paid hundreds of dollars for the event itself
  since you apparently cant read ill dissect my original comment for you    anyone else a little conflicted about the az winter ild coming up  i am on the fence about whether or not i want to go and i am looking to see if others felt the same since there were only 10 rsvps so far    yuletide would be a cool theme except  i dont have anything against the theme i actually think it could be cool but     its being run by l who is a really obnoxious sjw edgelord   i dont like l sue me    and i dont know if i want to pay 60 for halloweenmas   because l is running it and based on her posts it seems shes trying too hard to be so spooky about the whole thing i dont have an issue with the price i have an issue with whether or not itll be worth it to go when l seems to be turning it into a pagan circle jerk    not to mention its in tuscon again  i feel like every ild is hosted in tuscon or at the english rose which is also way too far imo      in summary  i dont have an issue with the price location or even l being there its the combination of all of those things that made me wonder if it was worth it i wanted to get other peoples opinions on it but apparently you cant ask about az without az collectively screaming in your face
  do you even fucking know l   she planned last years winter ild and it was great plus as another anon mentioned its being hosted by a number of people    you sound cheap af maybe you should have thought about the fact that ild comes twice each year and planned ahead choosing either halloween or ild if your broke ass cant afford both     also if you know anything about the comm you know there are always carpool threads because the comm is basically split between phoenix and tuscon and everyone drives    i dont see you planning an elaborate ild meet in phoenix
    you are reading way too much into this they are combining the winter ild and christmas meet the text is just to add interest thats all there is to it
  againthe money itself is not the issue the whole conversation began because i was wondering if it was worth the 60 and long drive for a meetup hosted by l because she seems like shes trying hard to make the meetup edgy    stop defaulting to lel ur poor when you dont have a valid argument i have the money im just trying to decide if it is worth it to pay
i really miss my comm im doing a study abroad for a year in japan and its really wonderful i love living here and getting to go to closet child whenever i want but i really miss my comm i see something and i think oh if x was here shed love this or this would be a perfect place for a meet x would go crazy for these parfaits and such and get really sad
  the bitching in this thread is fucking painful im from a different area but i looked it up and holy shit its only 1hr 45 between these cities     how is this an issue the cities in my area are all way father apart than that i just dont go to meets anymore since im 3 hours away from the city and no one lives near me
  dont girls complain about this venue after every meetup that is hosted there
  i a i wish i had a comm to bitch about the closest city is 4 hours away from me and even then no one wants to pay for anything more then a happy meal at mickeyds lone lolita life isnt bad i just wish i had meets of substance to attend that werent half a days drive away
  anon dont feel too sad i used to live in a city with a tiny community our meets were 3 people walking around a crappy mall now we have 100 members and tons of interpersonal drama sometimes i miss it being my niche hobby and not having to be around a bunch of entitled weirdos with no social skills
  same we used to have a tight knit comm until one of the veteran lolitas started to feel threatened and made up lies about a bunch of the other established lolitas now the comm is all itas and newbies
i figured this was the most appropriate place even though its not my comm per se but maybe her comm members will see i recently bought a dress from the user rissetensai on lm on the vetted discord and it was the single most awful buying experience of my life    on august 28 i paid rissetensai a nonrefundable 10 to hold a like new worn once holy lantern zipper jsk in red with free shipping the hold lasted until i got back from travelling on september 14 at that time i started paying the dress on a payment plan along with two handkerchiefs i was also purchasing i paid for the dress not including the handkerchiefs 300 which i thought was reasonable if maybe a little high for a dress in like new condition i would have one month/until october 14 to finish paying the dress off i sent the last installment on october 6 she shipped the package out on october 10    i received the dress on october 19 before i left for work i verified the dress and handkerchiefs were in the package and thanked her at the time when i got home later that night i realized that the dress had two major stains and two minor stains on the front of the dress in highly visible locations  1/2
  i was not able to ascertain the nature of the stains but my best guess was that they were oil/grease based perhaps from a sauce of some sort one of the stains was severe enough to have bled through to the lining    at this time i decided to ask about a partial refund risse apologized for having not seen the stains and not inspecting it well and offered a 20 refund or the cost of dry cleaning i was reluctant to send the dress back having been an international shipment so i said i would be willing to take it to the dry cleaners and see if the stains came out if it did id take the refund of the cost of dry cleaning and be done with it if not i wanted a refund of 75 for the damage in addition to the dry cleaning cost    she declined to accept this plan so instead at my own cost 35 i paid to send the dress back to australia i shipped it back on october 20    the package arrived on october 29 at this time she sent me a payment through paypal goods and services of 280 i understood that there was a nonrefundable 10 deposit which i understood and accepted upon asking why she sent 280 instead of 290 she stated that she was keeping 10 for shipping because i kept the handkerchiefs having had enough of the situation i declined to contest the fee but i was irritated as the dress had included free shipping and two handkerchiefs were a negligible additional weight i then realized she had sent it goods and services instead of refunding the invoice so a 16 fee was deducted i had to refund her the payment and asked her to refund it through the invoice at this time she stated she couldnt figure out how to refund part of an invoice and that she would also need to wait until the refund i sent her cleared i had to inquire about the status of the refund twice before she sent it on november 2 a full four days later    i will not be purchasing from her again and id advise other people do not either  2/2
  oh heres an imgur album of the photos i sent her when i was showing the stains    
    id say youre best off posting this in the general itll be seen by more people and will hopefully help someone to avoid a negative experience im sorry about what happened to you anon i hope something good comes your way to make you feel better soon
  yup theres a bunch of actually good tea places in that part of the city but they pick the one with mediocre food and a 3 star rating
  sounds a lot like my comm nowadays unfortunately the lies spread arent exactly harmless vendetta shit either so its ruined many relationships between members
whats going on with oklahoma comm the fb page is gone
this op picture gives me life  i wish i could attend an event like this at least once   too bad my comm is tiny
  wow what a cunt your offer to her was very reasonable shes never going to get 300 for the dress with those damages
  thats disgusting im so sorry this happened to you
  dw anon this always happens because all the event host/mods lurk on cgl i remember a couple years back for the la ild meetup someone dared to say they thought the desserts provided were lacking and the mods absolutely lost their shit the same old reee plan your own meet
  you could go to a con tea party or international event
does anyone have any experience with the singapore comm ill be going there for a short trip and was hoping to meet some of the locals
  nah its still there youre just blocked
  its disgusting youre still using art of an ex member that you all blocked
    deets you must of fucked up pretty bad to be booted without warning
  nah the mods just block anyone thats friends with people that dont like
  nobody blocked her or booted her as far as i know if she left it was on her own accord maybe quit trying to start shit if you dont know any of the deets friend    plenty of members are friends with the others and still in the comm and arent blocked sorry your lil feefees are still hurt i guess
  the la mods also ban people for interpersonal drama or plan 3 meets in one month when comm members complain about the lack of meets then hold nothing for months rip
          i wish you all would just fucking stop and make up so everything can be normal again i miss the way it used to be before everyone started hating eachother spreading lies being paranoid starting pointless shit over things no one even fucking cares about why can everyone just be the adults they try so hard to prove that they are and actually talk this shit out get it straightened out and apologize to eachother why nobody trusts eachother anymore and its so fucking stupid both comm groups are so stupidly desperate to one up and make the other look bad and its so old just fucking talk to eachother and quit whining and pointing fingers like babies
  the irony when you realise that rissetensai is the mod of her local sales comm
outsider looking in from a chill comm how and why in hell do comms end up with drama and vendetta anything that has ever happened for us has been nipped in the bud early on like do people not talk to each other in us communities does everyone think life is like bitchy tv shows where everyone is plotting against each other for god knows what do people enjoy it     i cant imagine someone getting away with shit like that in our comm like if ya gotta bitch about someone at least get it off your chest quietly and dont create an issue for the community
  probably a combination of either very large or very small communities longstanding groups where people have history and the general tendency of jfashion to attract attention whore types who are eager to start or involve themselves in shit    also its important to realize that what you see leak out on cgl or btb isnt necessarily reality my comm is talked about here sometimes but the people who actually go to meets and interact on the comm page are fine chill and everyone has fun its the people who just sit and armchair about it that insinuate all these wild rumors are some of them true in part but not to the degree anons like to describe its not a fuckin sitcom
  talking only works when both people want to come to a solution if one person doesnt see a problem with her behavior theres only so much you can do im in a situation where i have a mod who doesnt like me instead of dealing with her all the time i plan smaller meets for my friends on the side as far as planning meets for the group ive tried to step back from that a bit
  why would you want to make up with someone whose shown how much of a massive cunt she can be
    in my comm 99 of us vent privately to one person if someone annoys or pisses us off once we vent were good and get over it and move on like adults unfortunately we have one or two people who like to complain about everyone being ita meets not being good enough and not held where they want them to be held instead of taking the initiative to plan their own meets honestly if these few people could just vent privately like adults youd never hear about us because were a pretty chill comm and whatever is posted here tends to be blown way out of proportion my comm has had worse drama and drama mongers then has been posted here but she was dealt with privately without bitching and complaining on cgl so most of the comm doesnt even know that it ever happened until after she was expelled the way it should be
  try having sociopaths gaslight and manipulate people in return for favoritism and perks in the community that pretty much sums it up honestly
  i think in general comms will keep the serious drama to themselves ill vent on here occasionally but its always petty stuff if a real problem arises im behind the mods/comm regardless of my personal feelings
  the issue is that people dont always click it happens and places like here like to ham it up but most drama is that two people are not getting along and a bunch of outsiders gossiping about it for fun do people enjoy it well /cgl/ is drama filled so yeah they do so many posts are asking for deets on stuff and its actualky natural to talk about others dont take things here as fact its always exaggerated for fun
  gaslighting  favoritism     last time i checked communities just went out and held meets and called it a day not everyone is gonna get along and some people are attention whores thats just how normal life is ignoring people and moving on is free you should try it sometime
  pretty much my comm actually isnt great but you never hear about it on here because people dont want to drag the comms name through the mud by complaining openly on /cgl/ they either vaguepost here without naming the comm or complain to close friends when i cant stand something i bitch to my partner not online
  your all massive cunts
  ignoring people and moving on is free you should try it sometime  i suggested this in a thread once and several anons went off on me it was pretty hilarious but i think some people here feel like they are obligated to attend meets or something    why else would people force themselves to go to meets that they dont truly enjoy
  people in general dont seem to understand its just clothes you dont have to join a group post pictures online or be part of the online community essentially just to wear clothes  it sounds silly but you see so many people doing shit like selling all their clothes when they leave the community and generally tying up the community drama into their enjoyment of wearing clothes its just clothes you put them on and wear them inside or outside or dont you dont need a group of people to do this especially not when it just creates stress
  ill add that i used to like being in a group because i felt more protected being around other lolitas than on my own however this isnt true more people actually come up ask if its a play and take pictures when its a group
  nayrt but even worse     joking but only kind of
  youre
  i saw the negative feedback she left you lmao you need to report it to the mods desu
  lol maybe you should go to a real school to learn proper grammer instead of sitting on your ever enlarging ass
  grammar
  got em
  she could have meant that anon needs to take a class and learn about the lead of the tv show frasier
can the girl in the uk sales stop posting that bloody dreamy baby room its not worth 240
  this i remember she listed it on lm for sale one day only surprise surprise its still up
  i just envisioned a room full of lolitas all watching frasier and taking notes
  she originally listed it for 300 but graciously dropped to 240 if she so desperately needed money she should know how reselling works
  wtf does real school even mean we are all finished with school minus a few younger ones you dont even know who i am how would you know im not one of the small girls
  same here i used to find the walk to a meet alone the most agonising part of the meet but nowadays its way more relaxing for me than walking round in a big group bonus points if loud itas or huge brolitas are in tow
  ok cannolichan go outside for a bit
  canada
  my comm is similar to this anons    the people who actually go to meets and interact on the comm page are fine chill and everyone has fun its the people who just sit and armchair about it that insinuate all these wild rumors  its like dramamongering is inversely proportional to how active someone actually is in both the community and lolita as a fashion ive noticed that the people who spread the most ridiculous rumours and blow everything out of proportion on social media are the ones who attend meetups less than once a year and hardly have any coords they catch wind of something like a minor misunderstanding at a meetup and then take to social media to yell about how this proves that the entire comm is an elitist cult with corrupt mods abusing their power to bully specific members for no reason1 everything they say makes it very obvious to those of us who were actually there that they have no clue what theyre talking about and are just making shit up for dramas sake but to onlookers on btb and cgl it looks like our comm is a nest of vipers its really very frustrating especially when theyre doing it anonymously so theres no way for us to prove that theyre the ones spreading lies then when the mods make an open post on the comm page asking for community feedback/discussion its cricketsmp3 with at most one or two comments from people who admit that they have no idea whats up but they heard theres bullying and thats totally unacceptable and theyre so disappointed in our community because arent lollies supposed to be lovelies
  thats not to say that active members never gossip we do but the worst things that ever happened irl were misunderstandings that could be resolved easily by just talking about it like adults ive been in this comm for close to eight years and if you dont spend too much time on btb cgl and amino drama is practically nonexistent yet there are these people who have almost no involvement with the comm who claim that its super dramatic and catty and were all terrible people its like there are two x area comms the chill one im involved with and an evil mirror universe one that only exists in some peoples heads
  yes
  unfortunately calling them out isnt enough this comm needs a threestrike system and ask for nonrefundable deposits before a meet make a deadline date for when payments have to be in that helps a lot
  is there a time limit for notifying the host some people in my comm are flaky as hell but theyll send the host a message the morning of the meet or like an hour before its scheduled to start so technically they didnt drop out without telling anyone it really sucks to be hosting a meet and find out on your way to the location that half the people you were expecting to see have dropped out
  just reread our comm rules and theres no time limit if you report a bunch of people months after the meet im sure the mods may find that a little odd though the mods have a survey form hosts fill out to report no call/no shows so the mods can keep track the people who host often almost always collects money for a meet ahead of time so if people bail they wont he stuck with their bill
  right on cue just like   said kek
  i would be delightful if someone other than the usual girls would step in and host a meet it is a complete shame the mods offer wonderful prizes in the raffle whilst every thing else is mediocre i am sure that by now the raffle prizes are why most of the girls attend
  sol comm
  doesnt sound like it dont be so drama hungry there is other places in canada even a french area
  dont you mods have better stuff to do besides defend yourselves
  just was curious because im part of that comm and anons description was similar besides you just dont hear too much besides sol drama mentioned here
    im sorry to come out of the woodwork to be all not meee but i rarely go to meets and would hate for someone to associate me with shit stirring just because i rarely attend events the reason i dont is because i like hanging out with my best friend more than anyone in my comm  my comm gets shit talked a good amount on cgl but i have literally had nothing to do with it someone else in my comm self posts here and its whatever no one in comm cares and everyone knows about it there are some supposed shit stirrers but i have no idea who they are and if they even attend meets   and even though i spend a lot of time on cgl because its easy to be here on my phone and i rarely go to meets doesnt mean im responsible for people talking behind someone elses back i also have no problem saying something to someones face  sorry to be all defensive but i feel like this is the kind of fuel someone would use to be against me
  happened here too although it turns out they werent actually lying and even more people left after we found out    does canada even have decent comms anymore
  i meant a time limit for telling the host that youre going to drop out because some people will wait until the meet is about to start to notify the host that theyre not coming its better than not saying anything at all but still shitty imo especially if its something you wouldve known about much earlier
  clothes are not meant to be worn before others  ok then
  was a moderator the instigator for your comm too are you still in yours
  in my comm it doesnt matter after the reservation deadline is passed if there is a spot waiting for you you are responsible for paying for your seat regardless if you can attend or not otherwise you may be banned it sucks having to drop out last minute because your tire blew on the way to the meet on the freeway doesnt mean that the hosts should be responsible for paying for your ass
  my comm has a girl with borderline personality disorder that never comes to meets anymore but boy howdy does she do whatever it takes to stir the pot and create drama out of thin air we continuously have issues arise often over nothing and about things shes not even present for and blows it out of proportion every single instance of drama leads right back to her shit stirring and the mods wont do a damn thing about it or even consider giving her the boot i dont know if her disorder is the issue but in my comm it always seems like the ones who stir up rumors behind the scenes have some kind of mental issue
  she sounds like shes a hungry for attention and b delusional about how lolita fashion is supposed to work its common in newbies to think that you should be catty and competitive in order to make lolita friends you ought to tell the mods that youre feeling uncomfortable in the comm with her
  my comm has two separate girls with bdd theyve both done therapy and are really nice sounds like you have an asshole with no self control there
  why dont you talk it over with people at the actual meetups if youre not the only person annoyed by this   why is she still in your forums when she doesnt participate in the meets you should simply establish a rule that people who dont show up just dont get to participate in decissions or something just a thought
  definitely understand the feeling anon a girl in my old comm had bpd and she was an absolute drama mongering ass she even had a nasty habit of going after anyone she was seeking approval from if they did or said anything at all that felt like an attack or like she was being criticized even though it was never like that at all needless to say im glad i moved far far away    id suggest you keep your distance from her or anyone really with bpd if they arent actively getting therapy for it theyre exhausting burdening individuals that ruin everything i hope your comm leaders are able to see her actions for what they are and shes held accountable for it good luck anon and keep enjoying your frills regardless of the turds
  ah my comm rarely does reserves i wish it did i can sympathise with people whose tire blew or who got truly sick the day of but many people who drop out last minute say things like i have a lot of school work or not enough money or even its too far away like couldnt they have figured this out several days in advance sometimes it feels like my comm is full of womanchildren and hosting meetups is like herding cats
  so how many in this pic do you think are male
  here comes the sissy
  being this retarded
  no im srs
  this bpd actually has a cure time of 10 years and can be done through therapy       i doubt this person actually has bpd most people who suffer from bpd also suffer from ptsd so much so that it can be hard to diagnose i had a therapist tell me she wouldnt diagnose me with it because of the image it would create for other doctors and she left the diagnosis as ptsd  also a lot of bpd people are suicidal and filled with anxiety hanging out with people is the last thing theyre thinking about if anything theyre probably too scared to hang out with people for fear of what might happen
  yes and yes i dont go to meets anymore though this dude that just came back and started going to them was the final straw
  he came back a few months ago didnt he my face could only do so many looks of disgust when i heard that he came back i was initially planning on reattending meets and helping with comm activities and then i heard that k decided to join again nope
  zero
whats the most youve paid/would pay for a meet im fairly new to being active in my local comm and i was a bit in awe at the price of our winter ild high tea meet its 63  tax and tip which seems quite a lot for a meet that only lasts a couple hours yet all thirty slots sold out in a couple days granted the venue is a lovely place so the price doesnt surprise me my comm is absolutely wonderful so i dont mean this at all as a criticism on them they do a great job and this price is an outlier in terms of meet prices but it still got me thinking whats the most expensive meet you gulls have seen whats the typical price range for your comm
  its a high tea that sounds like a pretty typical price
  not counting national events with brand guests maybe 50 before i moved to the big city even free meets would cost me 1220 in bus/train fare food/drinks/tip for most meets at a restaurant or tickets to karaoke or the cinema is gonna be 825 and for something like ild with a booking for high tea might be 30 plus one meal isnt going to sustain me all day so theres usually a bit extra to buy a drink too 3040 equivalent is pretty typical
    i dont do meetups anymore but high tea in the city for me is 70 for each person not including tax its a splurge but you pay for the experience of feeling super fancy for a couple hours dont get me wrong i freaking love my cheap asian food but to be able to sit in a nice well decorated place in my fancy getup is one of the best experiences i would do again and again
  thats a totally normal if not low price for high tea service plus its ild people know the meetup is going to be more expensive than the average meetup
  nayrt but i know who shes describing and yes she is professionally diagnosed i never got close enough to her to see the ptsd side of her symptoms but everything else was a check in the box       sorry shes causing you so much grief anon ill discuss it with the mods and see if theres anything that can be done shes made several people uncomfortable lately but sadly as far as i know they are or were close with her at some point
        hm good to know ill have to make sure ive got some money put aside for next ild
  i think the most ive spent for a regular meet was about 45 on a high tea but im not surprised my area would be a bit cheaper a lot of states have higher taxes than mine
  our comm had two girls who were both professionally diagnosed with bpd the first one was banned because she was unapologetically abrasive and unfriendly to the point people didnt want to come to meets if she was going to be there the two defining incidents that got her banned were shitting on an event a lot of members looked forward to/inciting drama and the other for trying to take attendance away from another members meetup by scheduling her own on the same day because she didnt like the venue were not a big enough comm to support multiple events in the same day and it was very mean then we had another member and her stay was very short lived because she had a giant freakout screaming swearing at strangers etc on her very first meetup i think she set a record for getting herself banned she made the first girl look like an angel       i believe you therapy is hard but when you put in the work you can really see results in how you treat and affect people and i appreciate when people put in effort
im triggered by so many people using the wrong term for what i assume they mean is afternoon tea
  hello boston comm newbie thats actually on the cheaper end and summer ild is the same price so plan accordingly
  60 for professional tea everything included    45 for some crappy high tea at a lame place that serves six flavours of twinings tea bags    30 for a shitty tea place that is basically just a lunch/ brunch place with one tea and one coffee offered    10 for your shitty homemade high tea at your parents house that you still live in despite being in college or postgrad
  fucking this ive only ever seen a real high tea at one location in my city everything else is afternoon tea
  while i agree the name the place gives it is what you should call it high tea and afternoon tea is blended in meaning now unless the place specifically says its afternoon tea
  wow you sound fun why do you even bother to go to any meetups
  i actually didnt know this so thanks the_more_you_knowgif
  because i enjoy the more expensive meets and am willing to pay for quality because i dont mind free picnic meets in cute places sorry i dont want to pay 30 to eat shitty processed food in your lame middle class house i guess
  even in the uk where it originated a lot of the hotels in the hyde park area call it high tea for marketing i think kensington orangery still calls it afternoon tea but the meaning has certainly blended even in the country of origin
  if you go to a bakery that sells macarons but they call them macaroons what would you do
some euro fag is trying to sell a hideously stained ap op in superb condition no damages mentioned in the description who is this scamming bitch
  taking the photos in yellow light to distort the extent of the damage
  one of the la mods finally checked the thread im not sure which tired trope they use more defending the cannolis or booking events at tea rose garden
  theres a girl trying to sell a damaged aatp dress in the uk sales group on facebook as perfect condition could be the same person
  wtf    why even take a closeup of that part of the dress if youre trying to pass it off as superb condition does she think we cant see the stain does she have terrible eyesight herself or something so many questions
      i actually dont think its too bad if you can actually see the stain and shes up front that its stained borderline dodgy if she doesnt actually mention its stained though    yellow lighting is default in most homes so i could see a combination of being busy and unable to photograph the dress until after dark so they end up being stuck with whatever crappy light they have    think im more miffed that she apparently put it up  as bows  roses // pinks  mauves instead of eternal rose bouquet in lavender kinda weird to find a serious lolita doesnt know the name of an actual print that they own and doesnt know lavender from mauve
  no it hasnt what the fuck its still known as afternoon tea wherever you go here
  jeez thats awful the 2 in my comm arent abrasive to anyones face but instead come off as more grandiose and charming in person once you talk to them outside of a meet though holy shit its like they do a complete 180 they will sit there and nitpick any and everything someone might have done or said at a meet like its a personal attack on themselves and eventually resorted to the same behavior towards their friends if they did or said something they felt like was disapproving of them one girl in our comm is obsessively stalked and mimicked by one of them to the point she had a nervous break down and it was pretty upsetting for most of us im hoping if one of them gets banned then maybe the other one will leave on her own
  how the fuck can someone harass another girl until they have a nervous breakdown and not be banned already whats the requirement for getting banned murder in broad daylight
  all the trouble makers in my comm are the mods and friends of the mods so its near impossible no matter what they do they do a lot to cover their own asses and eachothers theyve pulled some stunts before in other situations to make it look like either someones elses fault or even the victims fault and its just really fucked
  holy shit usa
  they also have a cheap melty cream doughnut listed which im certain is a replica but they havent listed it as so anywhere it has no tags inside
a girl who talked shit about her last comm on cgl moved to my comm by being buddies with the mod im waiting for the day she starts putting our comm on cgl for petty stuff next
  30 to eat shitty processed food in your lame middle class house  why the fuck would you be paying to eat at someones house do you live in a third world country or something
  that and the steampunk person vthat keeps commenting what uk size is this learn to measure yourself and fuck back off to ugly steampunk
  how is this cheap  there were atleast 3 melty creams listed on ya for less than 140 usd last time i saw just because people on lm and ebay like to upcharge doesnt mean seeing the dress at actual value means its a replica lol
  i think theyre talking about paying for a ticket to a tea party meet someone is putting on in their home anon
  hahaha youre not l are you    but honestly probably nothing as usual english speakers are doing whatever the hell they want with others language and where i live the vast majority have adopted that pronunciation/spelling for macarons pretty sure 99 of the people who ordered would expect to receive a macaron
  do you have a video of the comm member committing murder i dont know if we should punish someone based on hearsay and a police warrant
  yeah i figured all our ilds were going to be around that price ill have to put cash aside so i can actually pay within the first day before it sells out
  charging 30 for a meet at someones house  sounds like youve got lolitas using hosting meets as a cash grab the most i can understand someone charging for a house meet is 10 to cover supplies like ill chip in so the host can get some nice food or craft supplies for the meet but treating it like a real professional event is bullshit
any other anons hate their comm describe the worst person there in a sentence or two
  im sure there probably are cheap genuine ones floating around like with most dresses on secondhand japanese sites as compared to higher western sales groups prices   however its not just about the listing price it doesnt explain why there isnt a single ap tag on it pic related other images from the listing as well as the pic from a mcd comparison blog post  when on the genuine dress theres a very obvious one at the top of the bodice near the collar  in which case it probably is a replica they havent described it as so and are therefore pretty scammy especially charging a price that could be a decent deal for a genuine mcd but way too high for some secondhand replica
  i dont hate my comm im actually blessed with a pretty chill one with active members and interesting meets theres one girl though havent run into her at a meet yet but based on her posts i cant help but assume shes an insufferable human being shes constantly posting updates on stuff she buys freaking out about sellers when they dont meet her completely unreasonable standards bitch the entire comm does not need a 5th update on your search for a headbow
  why are you still in your comm if you hate it genuine question
  not a person but all the genderspecials are cringe i get the impression they expect to be the only ones so special and they make introductions asking how to fit in and wear lolita with whatever their special gender thing is only to have a dozen other people jump in with the same situation they never come to meets tho
  my comm has one of these they got very upset with a couple people for misgendering them and will drop out of any meet those individuals rsvp to im sorry but being an obvious biological female wearing the most feminine fashion known on the planet its easy to make the mistake of assuming theyre female when first meeting the people apologized and never meant to i dont understand how this person refuses to use some situational awareness to understand that it is an honest mistake to make and just calmly correct others instead of blowing up about it
  sorry for getting off topic but holy shit i havent kept up with replicas and didnt realize how accurate theyre becoming im sure the difference in quality would be more obvious in person but in photos i never wouldve guessed
  yeah recent ones have become more convincing sadly i think ive even read posts where tags have been replicated that already definitely happened with some btssb usakumyas too  not sure if itll link through here but this is the original comparison post with mcd        the mcd replica came from a different taobao store that cropped up more recently than dream of lolita and oojia and they seemed more accurate with copying details there are still some small telltale signs however off colour/ poorer quality ap lace off colour bows and cheaper slightly shinier lining as well as missing tags
  because radicals ruin everything
  yep it happens occasionally in my comm wouldnt mind if it was just to cover the cost of food but it clearly isnt with the price
    then  is right who the fuck wants to pay to go to someones house i could understand like bringing over food like a potluck but paying the person cash to put something together if your house is actually nice enough for a meet then you should probably be able to provide food for guests  if the house is mediocre and the owner cant afford a meet up cost why are people going to their house like sure i go to my friends place but i never hand them cash to go grocery shopping
  yeah id prefer a potluck too we usually have swap meets at someones house and will do one its always a fun lowkey meey one girl in my comm did get professional catering for an in home tea once at least that makes it more worth a ticket price for sure
  i had a few people over for a meet and it was a potluck i spent easily 150 on the meet without asking for anything back since i didnt mind  because it went into supplies and decorations and making food that i could prep since it was my space if i had to fully feed people i would ask for people to pitch in its normal to pay your share of food
  i dont hate my comm but i hate some of the members in it particularly an extremely obese girl that dresses bad smells bad and cries abuse111 at anyone that doesnt agree w or gets tired of her shit she will interrupt conversations to tell the same cry baby abuse story over and over any chance she can or just blab about grandious fantasies about herself
  one girl in my comm did get professional catering for an in home tea once  one of the girls in my comm did this too for her birthday and no one had to pay she has a fucking apartment and used their complex club house it was nice as fuck too      if you can afford it then why would you charge
  why wouldnt you ask for people to pay for their share i can afford many things but i aint your sugar daddy its the same idea as a potluck really but instead of bringing food its money so its less work on the attendees to find something and travel with food
  i find this tasteless if i invite people in my home their are my guests    oh i must have tea party at my house sometime soon it makes me clean like crazy before so its winwin situation
all the hate on these home events wew    ive personally never organized one but i dont mind them at all its kind of nice being able to chill inside and not worry about the general public if the host was to prepare and buy all the food i wouldnt mind chipping in 1020 getting all the supplies can add up fast and isnt as cheap as people think at least in my country groceries are pricier    bonus if they have pets i can swoon over although i realize this can be a negative to some    ive wanted to host a home tea part for years because i have cute teaware and platters but i dont own a table or many chairs for girls to sit at rip
  try looking at it from another point of view theyre already offering their home maybe they dont have much money and cant afford a good buffet maybe they ask everyone a reasonable amount of money so that they can offer a satisfying buffet as an alternative everyone can bring something they cooked that said i think thats different than asking for a ticket to an event youre having at your house i dont think asking for 20usd or more is justified
  seems like a win win situation to me you guys should misgender them some more so they quit the comm entirely
  all the hate on these home events wew  the only hate is in regards to paying to go to someones house i go to girls houses in my comm  but i dont pay      maybe they dont have much money and cant afford a good buffet  again why would i be going to that persons house if they cant afford to feed some people
smallish comm  mod who used to organise a lot got busy recently so not that many meets  i hosted a few meets last year and there are a few local lolita aesthetic things i really want to do this year going to the opera the theatre a stately home  high pricetag discourages most itas or having to manage a huge turnout so those kind of meets are usually fun to host  comm recently got annoying poorlydressed brolita who comes to nearly every meet  cant post an event in the group without him rsvping  okay to be around in a large group at a public setting like a gallery but it would be impossible to relax with him drawing attention to our tiny group at a super fancy event  no way to exclude him without being obvious dont know enough of the comm well enough to organise a friendsonly private meet    im probably going to just go with my normie partner since at least i can trust them to behave appropriately but i feel kind of bad since the comms so inactive
dont know if this is the right place for this but has your comm had any dealings with any other alt communities   theres a local goth scene and any time weve interacted with them theyve asked us about our costumes even though we politely explain that its not a costume they seem so stunned and confused and ask how we can possibly dress like this all the time this coming from people in white face paint or wearing enormous new rocks or cyberlocks or generally wearing stuff that obviously stands out seems so bizarre     i dont expect everyone in any alt fashion to understand with lolita is since its pretty niche but the way they react to us just rubs me the wrong way we all look odd to the general public why not have a bit of comradery    has this happened to anyone else it feels like a lot of the new wave goths are just goths on instagram so maybe thats it
  nowadays alt fashion subcultures in general are full of normies that put on costumes and makeup for social media rarely outdoors so im not too surprised to see this disappointed but not surprised older goths do tend to know what lolita fashion is whether they like it or not depends on whom you ask but they are aware of it to some degree
  the gothic lolitas in my comm go goth clubbing sometimes and older goths are apparently all cool with it even if they dont like the aesthetic
  i know your pain anon our most annoying brolita/sissy was a programmer in his 30s with much more free time and disposable income than most of our members who are still in college so while he never really bothered to expand his wardrobe beyond 23 bodyline dresses ratty sneakers and a piss yellow ebay wig he did always have the time and money to attend every single meetup and event there was no way to escape him he was always there up until the point he got banned for being sexually inappropriate with several girls quelle surprise but even then hed be at every single convention for years afterwards his attendance only started dropping off when he lost interest in lolita or maybe found another group of people to creep on i hope your annoying brolita isnt as bad and will either get less annoying or fuck off on his own because people like this can be so hard to avoid
  who wants to gorge themselves on food at meets finger sandwiches and one dessert plus tea would be enough and isnt expensive at all i cook a lot for gatherings at work and i find that its way less expensive than people think if you just arent retarded and know how to pick the right recipes
  i dont even get a super creepy vibe off him at least hes in his 20s too so fits in with the comm not a huge middleaged man getting angry that women in their 20s who share no common interests dont want to hang out with him he just looks bad and draws a lot of negative attention to the group he seems fairly chill and ive never heard him discuss fetish stuff at meets but i still dont really trust hes not a sissy either since he wears pretty much the same outfit to every meet ie obviously not that interested in the fashion and afaik hes straight all those old lady reactions that would normally be ooh its rare to see young girls dressed up so nicely these days turns to obvious stares and discomfort as they assume its a fetish thing with him there    hes either a sissy with the social sense to know hell get kicked out if he openly admits it or an alternative ita with no fetishy ulterior motives but also no real desire to improve neither option is good like i said i feel bad because hes polite enough in person and seems like an ok dude but i know im not the only one avoiding meets because hes around nobody wants to come out and say it because it would cause a shitstorm from people who say being cagey around this poor innocent brolita would be terrible prejudice exactly the same as wanting to ostracise idk trans people or fat girls or black people in the comm because society look down on them too
  who wants to gorge themselves on food at meets  i always light snack at meets and then go home to pig out
  poor people i guess
complaining about being left out of nyc comm  was banned years ago  any gulls have sauce on what she was banned for
  she complains about not being invited to meet ups yet rarely hosts anything herself the last event in that group is from a year ago and i dont believe any meet ups have been hosted by her in years either      nyc is super cliquey and you do kinda have to work hard to find or create your own but it is possible just by hosting your own meets often and meeting new people and of course actually being nice in person      im glad the main comm actually has a bunch of public events finally its refreshing to see people actually trying to branch out instead of staying in their little groups     also im not exactly sure what this girl did except stirring up drama in the lj days her name was simply26
  oh shit youre right im surprised shes even still trying to interact with the comm
  what group/page did she post this in
  doesnt every comm have one of these
    this like no one running the comm is mature just really petty and self involved
  deets/proof
  idk what triggered it but recently shes been making a ton of posts shading the nyc comm for blocking her in rufflechat and on her personal fb
   they always seem to be morbidly obese to the point theyre on deaths door too
  i remember the lj days vaguely she was fucking creepy she stalked nyc lolitas if i remember it right and was banned for threatening to beat someone up or something she made her own page for a while but i think it died off     all i remember was that she wanted to host meetups in her home to play with coloring books in lolita and that she sent photos to metas fan page wearing replicas of their clothes lol
  she also trolled getoffegl by spamming disgusting pictures im nowhere near nyc but i remember feeling so bad for you guys for having this unhinged nutter in your area im legitimately surprised shes still into lolita
    oh and she bragged about looking more like mana and anime characters than a black girl she was feuding with and iirc called her ghetto and a monkey has she ever apologised for those days
      as a remark by someone not involved with comms at this point why dont people intervene at some point and suggest they look for help instead of putting this on a community of people who dont know how to handle this stuff because this is really all pointing to psychological trauma and mental health issues which can/could be treated elsewhere   in extreme cases id even say a community letting people like this put these things on them is even stabilizing their state and supporting this instead of helping them heal  just a thought
  if they cant afford to feed some people  the point is not being able to feed people its about offering something above ordinary like a nice buffet or something for which it is perfectly fine to ask people to equally contribute if the costs are transparent i dont want to eat cheetos out of a plastic bowl at an event like this and im willing to pay a bit for the effort the host has to make for that
  to paying to go to someones house  i think its rather tacky to make someone pay when you invite them to your house on the other hand its equally tacky to go to someones house and provide nothing in return this can be food if its a potluck or some form of gift cash is kinda iffy but i personally find it acceptable too     the problem is that most people in the comm are either clueless on etiquette or cheap and think its fine to come emptyhanded so i can see why people resort to making the guests pay
  most people in the comm are either clueless on etiquette  this is unfortunatelly true doubly so when the whole thing is about dressing up and dwelling in whats actually upper class or classy setting   comms should actually try to do nice seminars on etiquette really i dont know about the costs of those but they usually are being held in the form of a dinner or a teaparty event even where you learn which spoon to use when and how to greet and even orchestrate an evening event if you get like ten people or so to come i cant imagine theyre too pricy
  that sounds fun but the people in my comm who would benefit from it most are also the ones most likely to yell that lollies dont need to be lovelies and cry about elitism especially if the seminar is on the pricey side
  cry about elitism  are we going to pretend that a meetup like the one in the op isnt explicitly about the elitist/upper class setting why would you go there if you have a problem with elitist attire and/or dont know how to behave in a setting like this
  because the girls who cry about elitism and classism are the same ones who wear the fashion like a costume to be speshul while conveniently glossing over its inspiration rooted in european aristocracy
  the point is not being able to feed people its about offering something above ordinary  i dont know where you are from but where i am from you go to someones house to hang out ive never attended a fancy event at someones house thats fucking unheard of where i live if i go to someones house its because were friends so of course im not gonna pony up cash so they can provide professional catering in their living room  im curious to know where youre from
  it doesnt matter where im from why do you even bother to dress up then if thats your stance you know that people can host parties at theirs with mottos and such and put effort and money into decoration and food right you are familiar with these concepts where youre from
  honestly anon some people dont want the help or dont want to hear it  they just want to have a venue to inflate their ego/whine the way they want to i think suggesting help isnt where it will stop but both suggesting help and making it clear that this environment wont tolerate that behavior are the only ways especially the latter if they figure out that they wont get what they want attention through the comm then theyll leave if that really doesnt work then the moderators need to learn to step it up and remove these types of people from comms entirely that said shunning this behavior seems like it works pretty well on most folks
  jeez anon sorry you live in a ghetto im not rich but in literally any basic american suburb its pretty common to have a really nice catered dinner or party at someones house or have the host/hostess cook an elaborate meal if its family then sure id probably expect not to pay but if its friends or a comm and its going to be really nice food in someones nice house i wouldnt mind throwing down some cash i think it all depends on the situation if you dont want to pay money to have a meet at someones house then just dont go to that meet its pretty simple
  maybe idgi because im not american/australian so our houses arent big enough to host a huge group but if i was hosting a meet i wouldnt expect people to pay sure itd cost me money for food but itd still work out as about the same or similar to what id pay for transport and a meal in a restaurant at a meet so its not an expense im going to freak out over
  why do you even bother to dress up then if thats your stance  are you fucking serious do you only wear lolita as a costume then i wear it everywhere i go      jeez anon sorry you live in a ghetto  where does it fucking say that your assumption is wrong i live in a large city i pay to go into public places where i live like hotels where i pay fucking hundreds of dollars to have tea and here you are paying to go to someones house do you even fucking know them dont you go to your fucking friends house
  i do the oppositeusually eat an actual meal before a meet and only lightly snack this way  welllightlyim a disgusting animal with no self controlno wonder my old school pieces are all snug on me
  this girl just made a new fake fb profile with a different first name and the same last name and a fake profile pic of some asian lolita fyi its pretty obvious because her only other photo is a pic of her with the face cropped
  being this buttmad over a hypothetical meet that no one is forcing you to go to    take a deep breath in through your nose and exhale out through your mouth friendo ask your doc to lower your prozac dose tomorrow morning
  bruh what if i invite people to my house im not charging them if i wanna shell out hundreds or dollars then thats my problem you dont pass it onto the guests the fuck kind of hostess would i be
  missing the point this much  just stop posting already please
  being located in a city is in the definition of ghetto haha but thanks for taking a sarcastic dig literally folks like you make cgl fun    if its a meet then i never expect it to be free even if its at someones house plain and simple im not saying house meets need to be 70 or something like that but im not so broke or up my own ass that i get my panties in a twist if someone asks for 10 or less to contribute to decent food that isnt starbursts on a plate a meet is different from just going to a friends house if you dont want to pay dont go if you dont know them dont go if you dont feel comfortable going to their house dont go youre getting really worked up about something that isnt that big of a deal anon if you dont like meetups at peoples houses then organize your own meet somewhere else
  hey thats fine all im saying is a modest charge for something like good food or materials if its a craft meet really isnt that big of a deal i never assume meets should be free no matter where they are if the money theyre asking for isnt worth what theyre giving then thats a whole different issue
  simply26  in the distance horses panic dogs bark thunder rumbles   yall motherfuckers forgot simply
  its not just the food money but labour too anon the fact that im impeding on the hosts personal space and probably making a mess theyll have to clean up later means that i shouldnt show up emptyhanded plus they probably had to take the time to buy that food prepare that food prepare the house etc such a hassle in order to create a good time for everyone     i know i would be a bit miffed if i hosted an event at my place and people turned up thinking its a free meal ticket or something if its just a bunch of my close friends that are practically family i dont expect them to pay but thats also because theyre getting the orange juice from the fridge themselves and all if im putting in the effort to host an event properly i hope the guests will be thankful and give me a bit of face in return
  i understand that but if i viewed those things as a burden i simply wouldnt host a meet of that nature i agree its courteous for people to bring a gift or contribute somehow eg by bringing a bottle or helping with cleanup but outright asking for payment makes it into a transactional relationship thats more drama than the money is worth you dont want accusations you pocketed some of the money so you have to make sure you spend all of it but for more than half a dozen attendees any amount of money thats worth the hassle of reminding people to pay would quickly add up to more than you can spend comfortably while still keeping everyone happy    so many lolitas have dietary restrictions and id rather just buy what i liked and take a small hit in the pocket than charge a flat fee and then end up with vegans or whatever grumbling because they paid the same as everyone else but half the budget went on things they cant eat
  no she still thinks she was banned because the comm was too elitist for her
  i think im certain weather it would be more comfy to have an in house meet and i agree if you decide to have a nice dinner or lunch that stuff can add up ingredient costs add up very quickly    i understand if it was a potluck i wouldnt want to pay but if a host was cooking everything and providing a space food and drink it shouldnt be absurd to give them 1520 dollars or bring them a gift at the very least     my family has a long history of at home entertainment and thats the thing i notice the most their friends will bring over alcohol desserts sometimes side dishes or will just shell out cash for a side of meat or an expensive dish and when its over you take home your portion of the meal or if you dont want it leave it with the host its typically an unspoken rule but unless someones demanding 20 bucks a person to eat egg salad sammies their mom made with costco bucket egg salad mix you gotta be some sort of special or a downright dick to not provide anything in return to someone hosting     on another note i love the idea of hosting a wonderful luncheon or high tea at my house once i have it finished it would feel more authentic i feel to have a simple meet to get to know each other without worries of outside eyes i know its nice to be out in public with other lolitas but it does get exhausting sometimes
  i was at first under the impression that asking for money was no big deal but i have to say i agree with this anon unless youre willing to turn it into an event rather than a cozy house meet asking for money does change things especially to poorfags who will end up starting drama in the comm i was raised to never go over another persons home unless youre willing to bring a token off goodwill but my parents are terribly old fashioned and i dont think most people are raised that way or even do that anymore regardless i think maybe suggesting if others could also bring a small dessert or beverages that maybe theyll get the hint not to make the host take the brunt of the financial damage
  being located in a city is in the definition of ghetto  you clearly dont live in a city the ghetto is located in the poor part of town  no one in my comm has meets at their house cause we can go to a hotel
sooo sick of this home tea part debate someone actually post about whats happening in their local comm are there neat holiday meets coming up winter ild meets
people who ask for payment plans dont deserve your brand
  just a regular holiday tea party with a white elephant exchange not set on location yet but hopefully soon theres a gorgeous historic bnb in town that weve been meaning to visit though   i just hope that if we get it thered be no guests staying so we can have the place to ourselves     30 for a shitty tea place that is basically just a lunch/ brunch place with one tea and one coffee offered    these are the worst for some reason they tend to serve foods on cake stands that shouldnt be placed there like full sized soups and salads and/or sell shitty overpriced gifts like onions candles or christian bible quotes on canvas     anyway personal take i dont think its unreasonable to ask guests to chip in a little but i wouldnt ask for more than 5/person or to bring something to share every host and tea party situation is different id honestly take a homemade tea party over those luncheon places any day    /polite sage for repost    some my phone suggested onions instead of onions candles
  a girl in my comm is having a private ild meet while the rest of us attend the actual event ive heard some brag about how our comm isnt splintered but it sure does seem that way
oh fuck i forgot about this word filter thats hilarious
  what in the fuck is an onion candle
  probably revealing myself but i once hosted a meet where i bought a bunch of little pastries and quiches and things from a local caterer i didnt charge anything but gave my paypal in the event in case anyone felt like chipping in one girl gave me 5 and then took it up with the mods after the meet because she thought i scammed her i spent close to 100 out of my own pocket which i dont mind but being accused of ripping people off when i never said she had to pay anything in the first place left a really bad taste in my mouth and i dont think ill ever host a meet at home again
  lmao  its a word filter i totally forgot about     s o y gets turned into onion  just like t b h becomes desu
  ahaha sorry totally forgot that was a thing
  im curious at what point does a few friends hanging out in lolita become a meet if theyre bragging and calling it a meet thats shitty theyre obviously trying to stir the pot at that point    however i honestly dont understand when some people get mad when theyre not invited to someones personal event just because someone joined a facebook group doesnt make them entitled to someones private plans
  i dont mind it i like selling stuff i dont wear i dont need the money right away so as long as they pay within a couple months its fine with me hopefully these people who need payment plans for a 90 dress actually have lolita blouse and accessories though
  heading to ild for a comm in a different state im hoping itll be full of less drama and im really looking forward to meeting new people and making new friends
  yes thats correct anon as previously stated i do not live in that part of town
  i dont think you replied to the right post
  in this case shes calling it a meet also were having a huge ild event she probably just doesnt like the venue or something
  thats such a weird and rude thing to do out of curiosity do you think theyve started another comm i know a couple new ones have sprung up lately like the midwest one
  i can understand a payment plan for a 400 set or something but anyone who asks for a payment plan for 100 is someone i dont trust to be responsible with money even if theyre in my comm and ive met them several times so many lolitas i know have plenty of disposable income/allowance but keep spending it on unnecessary shit how much imported japanese candy do you need really and then whine about being poor i know a few girls who get more government assistance to sit around their parents house than i get from my full time job after taxes and rent yet theyre constantly complaining about how little money they have for lolita if one of them wants to buy a dress from me she first needs to show me she can save up at least 100 youd think it would be easy considering they often dont even have to chip in for groceries and whine on fb when they do
  do you think theyve started another comm  nah im kind of torn on it i think her and her friends are kind of cliquey but at the same time shes allowed to hang out with her good friends im not good friends with anyone in the comm really cause i dont go to many meets and she doesnt seem to either but shes pretty nice and i was just kinda bummed i wont get to her see her when i see everyone else i hope she has a good time with her friends tho after all its ild and everyone should get to do something whenever they can
  last year ild had a really nice venue whats the problem
  i want to host my first bakery themed home meet keep in mind that im in a very small comm so i wont have to deal with strangers coming to my place and we will be a small group    do you think than preparing biscuits with cute pastry cutters could be done in lolita or its too messy cooking with friends is always fun but do you think it can apply to lolita too if we remove pettis maybe   or is it a better idea to just bring home made sweets and eat it with tea
i saw a post earlier from a lolita that wasnt sure what she wanted out of the fashion anymore well one thing that really helps me get reinspired is looking through my wardrobe and remembering all the things that made me fall in love in the first place    for me its accessories from socks and bloomers to wristcuffs and headdresses im absolutely in love i actually find myself wanting these types of things over most main pieces i see im an old schooler so that might be part of the reason       what is it that you absolutely love about lolita is it a specific type/cut of dress you cant get enough of does torchon lace make your heart dokidoki or maybe its a certain fabric that gives you heart eyes bonus points for pictures because i want to see what it is that makes you happy and perhaps some other anons do as well
  look at this shit my heart
i really like waist ties no matter what style youre in youll at some point have to tie them and the feeling of tightening freshly tied bow just feels very satisfying
when i put on a bonnet or a headdress i feel so warm and everything wells up in me and when my shoe heels click i feel so good listening to it knowing i am wearing stuff i love and no ones stopping me from doing it
im probably going to get hate for this but i just love prints a well done print will get me every time im just a sucker for artwork on clothing i do like owning non prints though
oof way way too many to list i love the lace and bows and the tiny details ruffles and pintucks especially make my heart flutter i love garments that have loose ribbons that need to be tied into bows i love the feeling of perfection when i finish getting dressed and see my reflection in the mirror  but most of all my favorite thing is seeing my skirt flutter around me when i walk doubly so if i happen to be listening to music related to the fashion malice mizer ali project etc it gives me an odd but pleasant feeling of power and confidence that i cant really explain
pockets in ap dresses  little things that make stuff more versatile detacheable sleeves removeable bows etc i recently got an oldschool dress that has a removable lace panel thats just neat shit you dont see anywhere else
man i just really love lolita   custom lace designs on items  pockets  the heavy comfort of a cotton dress  being so poofy you almost knock things over  bonnets no matter the occasion  wearing a lolita dress as a sundress   being able to look at myself and genuinely think i look pretty    these are just a few but lolita makes me so happy i cant really put into words all the different ways
  ugh same about the loose ribbons i love being able to take my time getting my clothing to look proper and the feeling of my petti bouncing as i walk is pure bliss
i dont give a goddamn fluff when people talk shit about prints with teddy bears bunnies ponies etc and about it being ageplay yeah there are fuckheads who take a giant dump on lolita by wearing those sweet prints but i still love the dresses anyways im a grown ass woman and when i see toy parade or sugary carnival it still makes my heart go doki doki bitch shit on it all u want ill just happily live my life in my 20102012 sweet lolita wardrobe
  pockets in ap dresses  yes why doesnt every brand do this its so rare to have clothing that is extremely cute and unique but also functional
  i too love loose ribbons    i also really love seeing my shadow when im out something about that poofy skirt and chunky platforms makes my heart explode sometimes i joke about going on a date with my shadow when people ask me why i am dressed up but pretty much its true since i think i spend more time admiring it than i do anything else
  same
  girl yes  i am here for this post sweet prints are so cute     kill all age players t b h
i just love dresses with built in petticoats i love being extra fluffy and powerful
aristo not lolita but i love seeing everything put together just so and knowing that im both beautiful and formidable a good first impression can do a lot and i love what aristo does for mine
i love uniquely shaped pockets custom buttons are also really cute    i also love how lolita brand socks look even just plain white otks will have cute detailing like lace or scallops that make them cuter than normie otks
  this mmm op from 2003 has pockets and it makes me so happy
trying to think of something not already listed  i just really love the feeling of being in another world looking so different and creative this feeling swells in me whenever im wearing lolita out for regular errands or just taking myself on a date feels unique and joyous
    i love the look and feel of cotton lace especially lightcolored lace standing out from a darkcolored fabric
i love the bell shape i live for the bell shape the perfect bell shape brings me life  which is i get really angry when i step out and its gusty and the wind blows my skirt against my legs i hate that
  i get this im an old school lolita but sometimes i see myself in pictures and really just want more poof not enough and it looks limp and sad but enough maybe even slightly more than enough and my heart feels so full and happy its super flattering too imo
  headdresses rectangle headdresses especially older ones i have the crazy urge to buy unique and interesting old rectangle headdresses whenever i see them call me crazy but i also wear them with nonlolita clothing too i dont dress normie though so i dont think its too odd
  yes i agree    i also really like washing lolita clothing there is something about it that is more like a ritual than just throwing something in the wash its always amazing buying something super cheap 2nd hand because its stained and restoring it
i love halfshirred dresses  there is nothing more exciting than a beautiful dress that fits comfortably every day i feel like im wearing something slouchy and i look like a dainty beautiful puttogether lady
    beautiful lace  little pintucks that run for inches down the skirt  the lovely combination of colors and lace  twirling and letting a full skirt spread out  the swish of petticoats and skirt when sitting down and unfurling the skirt when you sit  glancing down at beautiful details as you walk  getting lost in looking your best in a way that most of pop culture has forgotten  going over the top and getting complimented on it  dat poof   feeling really elegant and put together and organized in at least one small aspect of life    i could go on and on but thats about it so far
good thread op
the lace i honestly think im going to have to contact innocent world or moitié to buy like 10 meters of lace so i can build and line my own custom built coffin because the lace used in standard coffins and fast fashion clothing is so substandard
  kind of the same anon i enjoy so much feeling like a fairy tale character whose everyday life is a fairytale quest it helps me reenchant a gloomy and boring adult world i have to live in
    seconded big time this is the exact feeling that makes being a daily lolita so much fun
the detail and artistic value of the prints    i fell in love with the fashion because of this along with the whole mixing and matching aspect of it
corset lacing  screenprints  custom lace  pintucks  pockets  overlays  flocking  velvet  chunky platforms  asymmetric skirts  lace of all kinds  all the things you can put on your head  those cute ass velveteen roses  speaking of roses roses on everything  velvet    probably missed a few but this covers a ton of my favorites
its generic but i go fuckign apeshit bananas for crosses/nun/nurse themed dresses im not christian or anything but something about it really does it for me i like the simplicity of the shape and how most of the dresses are nice solids and are simple
  you made me laugh anon but i agree i especially love older lace styles and although im not too fond of the way tulle lace looks i can definitely appreciate the quality when it is there to be honest being into lolita has made me quite a snob when it comes to lace so much so that if a nonlolita clothing item has bad lace on it no matter how much i love it i cant bring myself to purchase it and would feel gross wearing it
  iirc there was a brand that could contact their supplier and make them produce your custom lace design atelier pierrot i think it was
lolita helps me look forward for autumn and winter maybe spring depending on how warm it is i sweat a lot thanks to my unfortunate genetics so i wear a lot of normie clothes during the summertime when its finally the cooler months i wear lolita happily with a thin or medium thickness cardigan outside and i feel so comfy and toasty due to all the layers and my mannish body temperature
the tiny details like the buttons and lace around the straps overskirts the swish of the poof the entire transformation process alsohaving a crazy supportive boyfriend that doesnt make me feel self conscious about this hobby at my age and the lengths he goes through to make me happy  also its getting told by strangers i look amazing as if i needed to be reminded  
  sage for me not knowing how to properly post gifs
  this is one of my dream dresses i got one for my friend as a christmas gift when they first came out but i was too poor to grab one myself at the time im usually not into sweet but one day ill add it to my collection     a small list for me  pintucks  unique lace  feeling ladylike in a full coord  flower corsages  checking lolibrary for brand offerings  fancy underpinnings  textures  i love me some velvet some tweed some heavy cotton basically anything as nonnylon as i can get it ive become a dragon that hoarded mary magdalene dresses i wish they werent mostly dead nowadays even though some of their newer unique releases were questionable  i just recently found the headband for pic related maybe one day ill find the corresponding dress
having so much physical presence in a poofy skirt  massive hat/headdress is great im quite small so its nice to see people move out of your way when they see your portentous volume haha
probably going to sound weird but lolita is the one fashion i dont feel like a frumpy sack in and im an old school lolita
i love lolita so much i am pretty casual most of the time but i will jump at the chance to dress up 100 i wear a petti almost every day and i have really pumped up my wardrobe game this year so i can almost wear a dress one day a month im able to get away with wearing some a couple times a month    im still perfecting my look but in lolita i really feel like myself ive always been a little awkward and ive never really felt good in normie clotheswhen my clothes are pulled together it gives me confidence like nothing else     i like gearing up with the layers of tights and bloomers and sometimes a waist cincher add a wig and im pretty much armored up    i love seeing cute girls in lolita i get to imagine being with someone who is like me and just dies over frills someone i could combine my wardrobe with and twin with    i love the embrace of femininity for femininitys sake i feel beautiful and i walk differently when i wear my lolita shoes and with a blouse and petti     i love looking at my closet i love seeing all the prints and colors i love touching lace thats been so delicately made and sewn    i grew my hair out for five years to look lovelier in lolita i always had it short because my mom didnt let me grow it out as a kid but i finally stopped cutting it and i think its amazing
  same anon same let our femininity consume all that come near us  
  with what kind of other nonnormie fashion do you wear rectangle headdresses anon im interested in incorporating stuff like that into my nonlolita clothing too
  just about everything but especially goth i wear bloomers  fitted metal band tshirt  headdress/wristcuffs/lolita socks a lot headdresses look good when youre trying to add a cute/girly/dolly element to whatever it is that you are wearing my suggestion is to make sure that some other part of your outfit complements the headdress in some way so it doesnt look too out of place if you have a headdress with torchon lace for example try to wear socks topped with torchon lace too or some other accessory somewhere with a similar lace like bloomers or something
  this gif is so cute aaaaaaa
i love a lot about lolita but goddamn i fucking love the shoes you can wear it with the bows scallop heart details and straps give me life  i never wear heels in normie clothes but in lolita i go nuts i feel so cute and feminine in them especially ones with chunky heels
other than feeling fancy and untouchable largeness largeness and excess     i like thick platforms and fuckhuge skirts i like taking up as much space as possible layers and layers of ruffles and lacefeelsgood
making collages on my phone is a nightmare but you get the gist hopefully    dresses with a style/construction/ detailing that makes them feel truly unique from other dresses a dress isnt as exciting to me if its got the exact same cut and details as 10 other releases  dresses with additional removable accessories aprons brooches collars jabots and yokes   custom lace heart shaped cotton lace on solid dresses   tiered skirts bustles additional frills and layers   dresses that move and sway gracefully with a large petticoat as you walk  volume lots of volume  velveteen dresses  plaid/tartan dresses with white lace details  screen printed details applique designs fur trims on collars and hems textured fabrics military/napoleon style details on the fronts of the dress   shoes with a platform big or small heel and straps along with extra details   novelty and plush bags in various shapes stars hearts animals berries chocolate ect   lace head dresses quality mini hats and animal ear details head bows with small charms and bows added  looking at a dress and feeling like its the first time you saw it every time you look at it also noticing a new detail every now and again   otks with lace tops tights with some details patterned otks  bloomers with plenty of frill slightly peeking ones are so cute  blouses and hoods with extra details lots of bows pearls and animal ears    i feel like with dresses i love they evoke a certain emotion in me when i see/ wear them its hard to describe but its like a feeling of nostalgia mixed with a sense of calm and strength along with confidence even if im just going for a day out to shop ill have a feeling that im going on an adventure where anything could happen and i feel unstoppable  i love my shoes and accessories to feel impossibly cute  i love both printed and solid dresses pretty much equally but personally its always the details and construction that makes or breaks a dress i love
oh man this thread made me really comfy and happy great thread op    i love looking at all the little details whenever i get a new dress i can spend up to an hour gushing over it and seeing all the flufflacerufflesspilling out of my lolita closet as i open it that specific closet is small and its getting hard to close it but its a good feeling it makes my heart feel full
  dont forget plushie bags lace aprons and bustles
i love the details that go into solid pieces where the lack of a print means the maker has to find another way to bring in visual interest pintucks pleats jacquard and otherwise textured fabrics  i love all the novelty purses shaped like cute things or everyday objects  i love gothic dresses with cutouts or sheer panels aps katrina immediately comes to mind  i love looking at my reflection in windows or mirrors when im dressed up and seeing how pretty i look  i love pic related i dont know why it makes me so happy but it does
  4  not original but i absolutely love nun coords im in the christian faith so to see two things i love really makes my heart skip a beat
this thread makes me so happy it made me think of oh maiden advance with a sword and a rose by arika takarano the whole thing is too long but heres part of it  this is what i think gothic and lolita clothes are a maidens armor which even a knights armor cannot compare to a maidens lace is her steel her ribbons are chains her dress hat is her helmet and her surreptitiously changes the blood that flows from her wounds into true red rose petals thus the maiden fights after all to live is to fight and to become beautiful is to become stronger  you are a noble being that no one may touch you are cute and yet tragic yes the ideal aristocratic maiden in my imagination is very much like you  there are often maidens who say but im not cute so you know though that theres no such thing as a maiden who is not cute its just that there are those maidens who dont have enough confidence however modesty is a virtue and those maidens wont become the kind of shameless women who are not mindful of their appearance thats why i think not having confidence is a step toward beauty too so stop looking in the mirror and sighing you must find at least a piece of yourself that you like the best for example a part of your face would be nice like your peachy cheeks or even your eyelashes your tiny pink seashelllike nails also would be fine the fact that youve got a talent for art or that your specialty is making sweets would be fine too its enough for you to acknowledge little by little that there is something that you excel in see when you think of it that way dont you recall this and that talent
  arika takarano is a gift to this earth
  lolita clothes are a maidens armor  god i love this
this is lame maybe but i love the feeling of wearing so much sweet im not a very cute looking person id definitely look better in classic or gothic but i love sweet   putting on a headbow always really kind of makes me go ah yes this is what i love nothing else gets me like that i go through phases of loving classic and gothic but i always come back to wanting to look like a massive pink cupcake
i fucking love the way skirts bob when walking  its so shameful but i always watch my reflection if i pass a dark window so i can watch the skirt over a petti move back and forth as i walk
hard brim half bonnets     also solid pieces with embossed details on the fabric    and pintucks    and the classic lacetopped socks
  ngl im pagan but priest and nun coords are honestly my fav
  going on a date with my shadow  thats some cute shit anon
  this gif makes my heart explode oh my god
theres a kind of magic for lack of a better term in the way beautiful materials are constructed to become part of your life   for me im alway brought back to that initial feeling of wonder when i discovered the fashion every time i order something that transforms the orientation of my tastes   i got into this fashion for the prints and accessories but switched to velvets and laces after purchasing a piece on a whim   before i would never wear red or religious motifs and now both of those are ingrained into my visual language because of an intense drive to purchase a piece on a whim  today i received a package with a long shantung flocky white skirt purchased on a curious whim and yet again i am aesthetically moved by its materiality   this fashion reinvents itself on personal and global scale its an alternate history and alternate future with an agenda to take up space in the present  finding new ways to fall in love with something proves that its alive
  ive been resigned to being forever single since my last relationship tanked but this gif makes me long to have another girlfriend dammit anon       this is adorable and same theres just something so pleasing about seeing the poofed out skirt on my shadow
con alt delete is coming up in just two weeks dec 1416  hyatt regency ohare in rosemont il  all things anime and free ramen    fourth year going and looking forward to it as my winter con to close out the year    if youre looking for a cgl discord with a channel just for cad come all gulls    
is this con even worth it
  i tried to find info on it and it seems so obscure and small that i have heavy doubts
  nayrt but conaltdelete sucks and if you wanna be let down is highly suggest it    i mean look at how many replies are in this thread in 24 hours no one cares about kopf cons lol
its basically just a mini anime midwest and only in the hyatt good space to fill if you have no other cons between now and anime central and youre local deadlift lolita came last year
last year was surprisingly good the game room was sad and overall its just smaller but the attendance was way more than i expected and the events and guests were great this year it doesnt look like theres anything going on though no good guests no one is hyped up at all and most people i know are just skipping on it i probably wont go it looks like they put a ton of effort into last year and none into this one so whats the point
  tbh its a con thats only worth ghosting/drinking at its a kopf con so there isnt much and most attendance is just people who dont know who he is lmao   its also funny to see him meltdown about ghosters
  no lolita events no care
  what do you mean i dont have the attendance i lied about having
      salty butthurt anons here who probably dont buy badges at cons cad is fine better than the shitshow that every other small size con in chicago has been lately its cheap plenty of booze a couple events worth seeing dealers room last year was actually decent for once most events are lame congoer panels
  pff what other smallsize con is there collegeran cons dont count
  im sorry but badges are like cheap as fuck and i can afford it easily its just a shitty con stop trying to suck your dick too hard kopfchan
  unless you have a lot of friends who go no its not
there seems to be no sort of hype for this con this year no publicity no discussion etc did whats his name embezzle the budget or something i always go to this con every year just never actually buy a badge i go mainly to get shitface wasted and throw parties in my hotel room in a con atmosphere with some friends who also do the same its close by to me fills the gap before acen and it helps out tremendously with my sad when it is at its highest during the year     if you gulls happen to go feel free to come to the party ill post the room number dayof        there are other cons in chicago i thought there were only 5 lmao
    idk about that theres 19 guests on the website and only four of them did i go who the fuck are you    though nothing big or japanese this year
looks like its time for another cosplay help thread old one here     post problems you are having and for the love of god someone post solutions or advice too
    kicking things off with a personal problem    im trying to dye some visor material clear petg plastic dark using idye poly im using the same method as a youtube tutorial about the same and as far as i can tell i am following their instructions        but my dye is way waaaaaaay too intense and comes out really uneven and splotchy pic related in the video they leave the material in the solution for seven minutes before rinsing and repeating but my first test piece that i dunked for 10 seconds came out solid goddamn black like it was a piece of cardboard no light getting through it at all     the pic related happened after i tried dumping out half the solution and dilluting it with more water to try and salvage the batch despite boiling the newly added water and stirring and letting things cool again i just end up with all of these instantaneous black spots all over it rather than the dye being applied at all evenly all after a 5 second dunk     what the hell is going on and how do i dye this plastic so its makes a usable visor if i wanted it to look like i just lightly spraypainted it i could have done that without ruining an old pot
what would be the best way to make ibarakis head markings i was thinking about craft foam but i remember seeing someone using some type of paper that looks good as well but i cant tell what exact material they used    the only issue i have with craft foam is how thick it could be looking at other pictures the markings look flat
can anyone recommend any good place that sells elf ears i want to cosplay link from breath of the wild but im not sure where to start looking
i wanna do a shygal cosplay but idk how to get her jacket/hoodie its too specific to just buy a red hoodie but no one on etsy is selling one either how do i fix this pic related used as reference

  why are you so fucking annoying lol are you 12
whats that gel everyones always recommending for creating scars it needs to go on the face if that matters at all  thank you
  liquid latex scar wax neither of those are gels per se but look into them

    ill buy this cut it up spray paint the lense black tape it to my suit and overlay the fabric  thanks
hi all new to this particular thread so sorry if this is common knowledge     ive been wanting to get into cosplay so have been looking into colored contacts went to the doctor to get my eyes measured and ask about colored contacts  get contact training have never worn contacts beforebut damn apparently i have large pupils so the colored area encroaches into my eyesight and makes it incredibly uncomfortable giving me blurry vision around the edges    does anyone else have this problem ive read that the clear area for contacts is standard and not changeable so im pretty sad thinking i should just forgo contacts unless there is an alternative brand with a wider center area or something i really like the effect contacts add to a cosplay but would rather not suffer through such discomfort  the sample contacts i got were doctorapproved of course pretty sure it was acuvue though im not sure if cosplayuse/asian ones would be much different in this respect
   do you should really just stick to the colored ones that you can get out your optometrist there really not all that bad either
      how is visibility through that i might do that next time     i did finally get the dye thing working by the way its not perfect but its good enough the trick is it seems that adding the color intensifier is just a nogo thats the shit that kept turning into black splotches without the color intensifier packet it worked normally
  some types of circle lens have a lot of gradient to fade them into your natural eye color so if seeing the color on your lens bugs you you could try those i think its normal to be able to see it depending on the lighting since your pupil will expand and contract
how do you keep your masks and helmets with lenses from fogging up i dont want to have to take it off every couple minutes or go blind
im currently working on a leper cosplay from darkest dungeon but i have run into an issue how do i make the hooded cape/poncho/cloak thing that he wears i would appreciate any help thanks in advance
  if theres room you can install a small battery or usb powered fan most stormtroopers do that
  it looks like a nuns habit
  anti fog spray   i use it on my swim goggles and i introduced it to my friend who cosplays spiderman who was having the same problem and he was shook its cheap
  need help over here got invited to a halloween dressup party never been on one before dont have much money for any good costume all i have is casual wear but i also have picrelated it got me thinkng what characters who used it are the most easy one to cosplay i was thinking just to wear my formal wear and say that i am a mafia member or something but it seems kinda generic any advice or ideas
    tf2 scout is easy red tshirt cap get some gauze and wrap your hands in it shorts with tall socks if you can find cheap costume dogtags those if you have a computer headset with microphone that singlestrap manpurse on your back optional
  yeah he was the first who comes in my mind too but my bat is much bigger like i cant even swing it with one hand so cast that idea aside but maybe i shouldnt have thanks anon
not 100 cosplay related but theres nowhere else to ask are cgl meet ups worth going to if youre too young to drink
should i prebuy my wigs for araragi and 9s or should i just buy some high quality wigs and attempt to style them    also as a dude how the fuck do i do basic ass makeup for cosplay
  well do you have experience cutting wigs  yes  style them yourself  no  pre bought  also youtube is a thing
  post legs
about to start working on this would a circle or rectangle skirt pattern work better im using a mildly stretchy poplin
  rectangle
  i mean since you asked
    im not very good at pictures
  yeah not going to work
  i think it will i can still work on my thiccness in the meantime anyway
  you need to shave also looks nasty and desu your legs are too manly
  its cold outside and i mostly wear jeans okay ive been meaning to make a sslon trip but i havent yet
    salon
  jfc cut your toe nails and shave
  judging by the legs posted id say a 12 year old boy
  no but ok
  the thing is that the ones i got from the optometrist are exactly the ones that are giving me blurry vision around the edges  though i agree that the color is not bad at all      thanks ill look into that and oh then is the blurring/being able to see the edges normal then   actually i was specifically told by the doctor that i have large pupilsnot just that my pupils were particularly expanded at the moment and when i tried the contacts on it was in a welllit area so i think it would only be worse in a darker setting i just cant imagine having blurry eyesight for an entire day or even a few hours
can anyone recommend me a printer that can take thicker cardstock for pepakura uses     ive been trying to use my current canon printer but it seems like it has a hard time printing on cardstock even when trying to adjust the settings     i heard top loading printers can solve this problem but i want to be 100 sure on this before getting a new printer     also sorry if this isnt exactly the right place to ask but i felt its the closest place since i plan on using this for cosplay sake i know theres an actual papercraft board but that board seems really dead
  id suggest some kind of inkjet printer i have an epson im pretty happy with tho i dont often use thick paper so i couldnt tell you how it does with that
  cardstock
  you could try buying a cheap wig from an fb group or on sale thank you afterhalloween sales and to practice styling on then move up to a real wig
  the only way that theyre going to get experience is by cutting a wig though
when cosplaying a character in uniform eg ghostbuster judge what are your thoughts on wearing a badge with your own name as compared to cosplaying one of the specific characters
  i typically like to keep with the characters name thats who youre dressing up as not greg ya know
anyone know where i can find some tutorials on modifying or creating shoes
i remember a while back there was a sakizou dropbox or something that had all the pieces organized by book does anyone have a link to that or a link to a good pile of the art in one place i feel like im always playing hide and seek trying to find some pieces of their art
  youtube or google
  where is this from i want to buy the bird badge
  i think its perfectly fine people do it all the time with ghostbusters since people like to pretend they are part of the group and not necessarily trying to cosplay as someone like venkman     im sure the same can be done with judges though ive never seen it done before
  /cgl/ meetups are cringe incarnate youre better off checking social media for local meetup groups youll get more regular interaction with less shitty people the big problem is any 4chan meetup tends to have crossboarding /b/tards who dont know how to behave in the presence of real people
  spray is iffy too much it gets hard to see out of not enough and it just looks purple
quick arda  black friday question is it worth it to wait for bf sales i just need one pricey lacefront from arda but dont want to risk it becoming out of stock      nayrt but how did the texture of your dye on top of the plastic turn out and is the plastic itself dyed i tried plastic with idye poly once cant remember if i ended up throwing in the color intensifier packet which may have also affected things and the color just sat on top of the plastic  it was like a soft residue that could get scraped off with a fingernail     i ended up using the krylon sea glass frosted spray paint the effect wasnt consistent but i needed a mottled uneven look
what would be a good travis touchdown wig im leaning towards a marty even though the rufio already has the fauxhawk look the bangs look a little sus for what id be going for
  faux hawks are really and truly not that hard to style get the lacefront
  makes sense it was more of a case of stickershock since im a noob who buys 15 wigs from ebay or halloween stores
  from my experience wigs dont sell out until maybe 2nd or 3rd day depends on their stock  i would say if youre concerned make the purchase few hours it goes up
what is the more iconic/easier to make weapon for archer from fate this will be my first prop made and i got 2 weeks and limited supplies no heat gun the upcoming con forbids bows from being strung which is a huge demerit for it here are my thoughts on it    swords   easier to make harder to paint no heat gun needed    bow  harder to make easier to paint heat gun needed imo not strung is lame af    any thoughts on it im currently charting out a stencil for the swords but some opinions would b neat
  swords seem to be the clear winner if you dont have the supplies needed to do the bow how youd like and youre not going to be fully pleased with the results no matter what because youd prefer the bow to be strung     i dont really know fate but ive seen more pictures of archer with his swords than a bow so i think youre fine from the recognition front
so ash cuts off his right hand and replaces it with the chainsaw  i found out that bruce campbell is lefthanded so he still had his dominant hand free  since im righthanded do you think i could get away with doing the chainsaw on the left instead for convenience or will everyone just say wrong hand screwhead
  how badly do you need to use your dominant hand
  this would be achievable with a hollow chainsaw prop that had a place to grip inside spend most of your con day with the chainsaw prop on slip it off to do whatever you need to do      thanks for the input i should just bite the bullet and go for the purchase
im going to a con next week and am in need of a wig for pic related by thursday of next week though the sooner the better  what sites would be able to get my wig to me in time i dont mind paying a bit extra for fast shipping as long as the wig is decent quality   amazon is really a last resort    i think epic will be at the con and im doing this guy on saturday so i could probably just head over to them on friday hope to god they have something that fits and do some horrifically last minute styling but i would like to avoid that path and just get something in via mail
is there any other way to color fur besides airbrushing or using sharpie ive been told not to use sharpie from a friend who is a furry but i dont own an airbrush to shade some fur
  you can use idye poly and other synthetic fabric dyes at low heat dont go over 60c or your fur will melt get a shade of color thats close to the one you want but always lighter than the one you want and you should be able to get your tint that way quite easily with synthetic fabric dyes  you can also use dry brushing and comb the fur regularily while youre brushing but it may be painstakingly timeconsuming if you want to do a large piece and it may always feel rough      swords always win in a bow vs swords argument theyre easier to make and people like them more
  im a 62 male where in the world do i find gakuran that fit me
  you already know your answer anon its either epic or amazon the in person approach sounds like a good idea too if you find yourself without options you could also look for halloween or wig stores in your area
  a gakuran is pretty easy to juryrig from a blazer if youre desperate    take a blazer from goodwill that fits unfold the lapels and make a new collar that looks like the gakuran collar not too difficult imo add gold buttons to it and buttonholes and youre set shouldnt take more than 2 days sporadic sewing imo and thats if youre a novice
  i ended up going with epic with 2  4 day shipping  wish me luck anon
which circle lenses is she wearing looking for these exact ones
  commission one

how do i apply large scale tattoos that wont flake off in half an hour
  you gotta start off with a good body paint and you gotta make sure its set and sealed properly that means reapplying the sealer every couple of hours    bodypaint  tats are kinda tough esp if theyre not on the arms
chest armor patterning and piecing together i can work with foam for any other armor bit for most projects but chest pieces always look flat and bad when i get them out does anyone have advice on making more complex shapes with such a large piece 
this is a really strange question but whenever i put a wig on i always feel like theres too much fiber on top of my head making my head look like a balloon ive tried doing my hair under my wig cap a different way so it lays flatter but it doesnt change how bulky it looks   is there any way to just thin out the top of a wig or am i better off shopping around for different wigs
  any good body paint you can recommend im going as rob lucci for animenyc this will be my 1st body paint cosplay too and anything about claws and wig advice would be ideal and id appreciate it i already have long hair but i know the character has way more hair than i do
  could you post a picture itd be helpful to see what the problem might be
  look for resources within the homestuck community theyve tried every method for horns claws bodypaint and a mixture of all three imaginable
  how are you wearing your hair underneath the wig cap is your hair thick or thin what texture is it how long is your hair where is the cowlick sitting when you put the wig on
how can i make these pants i made a first version using regular straight shorts that were too big for me but of course they came out just looking like normal straight shorts  how can i make them uh more puffy i guess
  harem pant pattern might work
  kamui has some helpful chest armor patterns      you could stuff it with fiberfill pillows or use quilt batting under your fabric to make it more poofy than just harem pants
  heres what im working on at the moment in the past ive also made xander from fire emblem fates and sandalphon from granblue fantasy both ending up pretty underwhelming and very flat lookingin the methods id used at the time
hey im a total noob at sewing and i need some advice for picking a fabric whats a material that is relatively heavy weight can get wet doesnt stretch much but can still breathe a bit  preferably something machine washable too but its not necessary
  itd be easier to help if we had an idea of what you wanted to make with it
  im trying to make a practical cloak for a renaissance festival
    canvas heavy cotton wool
  a rentype cloak would traditionally be made of a thick felted wool melton serge boiled wool that sort of thing obviously youre probably not going to want to be spending actual fullwool money on it but a poly or polyblend melton would be ideal for that its quite heavy drapes nicely warm and easily available
how do i get a cute cosplay bf
  i have medium thickness straight hair that goes just past my shoulders i part my hair into 6 sections 3 on each side of my head braid them and pin them in a crossed pattern similar to pic related   my hair lays pretty flat against my head that way and any bulk is on the sides but that doesnt stop my wigs from looking bulkier on top
how should i approach ahirus tutu should i use circular metal wire to lift up a petticoat and if so which shape and thickness would be best or should i layer 2 or just get a really fluffy one ive also seen some cosplayers approach it as lining at the bottom of her dress im so overwhelmed with options give me your guidance /cgl/    heres the tutu/petticoats ive found so far               
  thats helpful to see but i meant a picture of your failed armor pieces 
  my only thought is to try braiding them a different way like at the nape of your neck and sides of your head in small buns or just by focusing the braids there maybe watch some video tutorials for ideas otherwise try using 2 wig caps 1 netted and 1 stocking material or check out the wig itself to make sure that its sitting properly on your head thats a toughie anon
  your best bet is to build a base like the ones found on plate tutus and then have the pink part as a tulle ruffle they essentially layers of tulle that point upwards at your body like an upside down petticoat but much stiffer of course     pic related is the underside of a plate tutu       i guess redistributing my hair at the nape of my neck would help this is something thats stumped me for a while thanks for your help anon
  oh i totally forgot to say thank you for answering so swiftly i was clouded by my fear i appreciate the help
  you could buy a practice tutu i believe discount dance sells them and build on top of that then you wouldnt have to build the platter tutu they have specialized techniques to make them and youd probably have to do quite a bit of research
  a normal petticoat wont give you the plate shape she has youll get more of a soft aline shape like the bottom middle pic in your original post and pic related the grace karen one you linked wont work at all i wear one for vintage and your dress would need to be about knee length     i definitely suggest buying a practice tutu and altering it like  suggested instead of sewing your own if youre a beginner
    thank you for the feedback i was foolish to think it would be that easy ill take a look into the practice tutus or maybe ill just bite the bullet and learn how to sew a tutu after all thankfully i left myself enough time to figure it out
  ngl anon a tutu isnt an easy project to tackle even for people who have experience sewing props to you for being willing to put in the effort to learn i believe in you
i need a simple white mask with just 2 holes for the eyes big holes if possible and some belts to make it adapt on my head
  
new to cosplay i have half a year and would like to make as much of pic related on my own as i can i imagine i would need to commission his weapon and helmet but for his armor what do you guys recommend as far as materials and methodology go id appreciate any useful tutorials and such you could point my way
im working on the sunless set from dark souls 3 and i have been stuck on the sunless veil for a few months now i feel like it has more structure than just a plain fabric veil and i swear theres a name for this style of helmet but i cant for the life of me find anything and draping it over a wig head and going from there did not work out any advice would be greatly appreciated
  and here is just the veil you can sort of see that theres a base of some kind there
can you guys help me choose a wig for a caesar zeppeli cosplay  i cant seem to visualize what his wig would look like unstyled to buy the correct one
im thinking of cosplaying wonderland ruby from love live sunshine and want to make it myself this stock photo has this style of apron with a high back neck lace up detail and a clipon giant waist bow but i was thinking of a halter neck strap and natural waist ties would following the stock photo be better
ive never styled a wig beyond cutting bangs before and i need advice on the best technique to use ive got an arda chibi and i need the pigtails to each be one big curl i was thinking i could wrap them around some foam rollers and set it with heat from a hairdryer but the fibers are thicker than i expected so im not sure how well this will work
so how would i even go about doing this wig ive never done anything that long or messy also he has these pieces attached to his face ill post a picture where its more clear and i was wondering what the best material  attachment method would be for that for the shirt would it be best to try to find something that is already padded like that and modify it  add leds or am i better off making it from scratch no clue how to go about it if thats the case
  heres a better look at the stuff on his face
        make the dress first and then make an apron based on how you want and see if you like how it fits tbh i dont like how the apron in the stock photo looks in the back and i think the most aesthetically pleasing way for you to make her apron is if you made it like an underbust jsk but obviously adjust the front to be as high/low as you want      try using sparkle pipsis drill curl tutorial the roller  heat setting tutorial works well for smaller curls but if you try to do one big curl like that the fibers will be too thick/heavy to hold that shape    
what can i do to add more black to this dress i originally just wanted to add a black shawl on top of it but with the high neckline and bodice details that feels like itd clash too much i was thinking of adding a black veil but i also want to darken the main body of the dress itself somehow preferrably with accessoires
  for context im cosplaying princess luna
    my recommendation would be to dipdye the bottom of the skirt purple/black but it sounds like youre asking after accessories because you want to keep the dress wearable in a noncosplay context   black chiffon/tulle overskirt with a fancy belt/tie  pinning black beaded/gemstone brooches to the bodice  black tights/black operalength gloves
  to be honest im mostly just scared to ruin the dress because its so pretty lol i really like the overskirt and gloves idea time to go tulle shopping
so im trying to find good shops for midievil/wedding stuff only reputable shops ive been finding are like rivendale bridal and armstreet    can anyone point me another direction im set on making my dress but i want more costume ideas for my fiance and mens wear is limited    idk if this would be better in the larp thread or here
  larp thread would give you more specific resources my friend
  heres whats important in a base wig for spiked styling   the fibers are sewn in one direction front to back and down which will show the netting if you try to lift it up to style is like in the picture as such the wig you need will be sewn differently to hide those nets  shoot for a longer wig chin to shoulder because you can always cut it shorter    i recommend ardas jaguar classic
  thank you the encouragement really helps ill try my best
  i would look more towards fantasy film and video game influences rather than genuine historical fashion unless your bf is really into that stuff fancy medieval menswear is just not going to look cool or be comfortable for him to wear
i got these leather tall boots for a red dead redemption cosplay they fit really loose when i got them initially but ive been working on shrinking them and breaking them in for a while so they fit a lot better around the leg however im still trying to get rid of this crease down the front and back any tips on how to get rid of it
  just lay them down with the toes pointing up and leave something heavy on the calves some hardback books or something like that
  its what he wants thankfully were going with a medieval/fantasy theme so we can both put ideas in the wedding vrs a traditional/modern wedding that centers the bride
does coscraft ever has sales
could someone possibly draw out a pattern for 9ss coat i just cant wrap my head around it even using a double breasted coat pattern as a reference
  you really have to think about it in a certain way first of all think of it as two coats patched together along the chest the top half is a db shawl collared coat grey the bottom half is a fauxdb panel coat purple   for the top half its fairly straightforward db coat shawl collar with a high roll line the top section should end around 2/3 of the way down the arm hole which makes for a convenient frontpitch for the sleeve the roll line should stop a little bit above the bottom maybe 1/2 some sort of snap or hook/eye closure would be useful for it there are plenty of patterns you could use as a base ive seen other seagulls saying they started from vogues 8346  the lower half is a bit fiddly four panels which are only attached up a bit below the waist below that they hang free of each other the front panel would match up to the front side of the top only there wont be any db overlapping for the panels youll want either a hidden zipper on the wearers front right or hooks/eyes for those little x stitches the best way to do it would be to put eyelets on the panels and thread some thick thread or leather strips through them so they can be taken off/put on when you open/close the coat front  lining would be done like a normal coat make she shell make the lining attach them together at the top and front so the hidden zipper just pokes out then turn up the hems of each and handstitch together at the bottoms  its a weird thing to convey and ive done my best but im sure somethings not come across so just let me know what ive mangled
  no but if youre looking for coscraft wigs cosplayclues now has a termination sale with 35 off they also ship internationally so maybe thats an option for you they stock only coscraft wigs
i know its a long show but perhaps someone has mowkys video tutorial on tails i cant find it on youtube anymore and her tails are the best i looked through her store and she isnt selling a tutorial video or ebook either  or if anyone has any kind of tutorial for tails that bounce like her and look natural that would help too
  omg thanks anon as long as it is in eu anything is fine
pattern/template/tutorial for hooded capelet in pic related havent had any luck finding one on google would prefer to not have to buy a pattern
  just drape it you really dont need a pattern for things like this
ordered a shiny metallic zentai suit and i can barely see anything through the mask what are some good solutions so i dont need someone to chaperone me the entire time
first timer here so im sure this is a dumb question but is it necessary to wash clothes before wearing after dying spots onto them a few of my practice runs turned out poorly and im low of time so i was thinking of just skipping it but i wasnt sure if there would be any sort of residue that needs to be washed out before wearing using rit dye by the way
  ive always washed my fabrics after dyeing so i cant 100 accurately answer your question but i suggest that you do you never know what the spots may rub off on/stain and it might be your skin or someone elses costume
dont know if this is the right thread but im looking for more ideas similar to the following    virgin killer sweater  neko keyhole set  striped socks and underwear  that odd bandage looking bikini    looking for things that in the same category as that but drew a blank after that
  maid costume  school girl costume  just watch some hentai youll get the gist
hello /cgl/    any recommendations of something i can use to make the quills for this guy something springy light at least somewhat durable and receptive to paint
  eva foam would be your best bet i think it fits all those specifications
  micro bikini  heart keyhole on asss
  thanks ill check out the keyhole      thought of those getting school girl uniform but itll be more wholesome although maybe zettai ryouki type thing
  in that case what can i do to ensure quality through the wash just spray it with rits colorstay dye fixative
  my bf made a hollow chainsaw prop using the harley quinn one that spirit halloween was selling he painted it the right colors cut into the inside of the prop and installed a small grip make your life a whole lot easier happy building
  was trying to find the right word to describe this and drew blanks    im guess im looking for the anime / manga tropes that have the cute ecchi or lewd potential rather than something character specific
  this  theres even techniques to give the foam texture associated more with quills id suggest looking into kamuis negrigante armor from monster hunter its full of tons and tons of spikes which would be a perfect guideline for this costume
im looking to cosplay blue rose from tiger and bunny   ive got everything but the thorns figured out what kind of foam/method would you guys suggest in construction and attachment  i was thinking either eva or spray foam and magnets or maybe the ahri tail method
i really like the background characters in the sand planet music video and im looking to cosplay one of them i have a good idea for how i want to make a mask with seethrough fabric to cover the inside of the eyeholes but im stumped on the jacket  where can i find a hooded jacket similar in style to the ones they wear since there are so many im not looking to emulate an exact jacket but i do want one that looks similar enough i can modify it with fabric of my own to get details down but im looking for a good starting material
i need some makeup advice  ive got quite the handrubbingmerchantjpg nose what can i do to make it look less bad  ive tried a lot of contouring but it doesnt help and yes i know the light in this picture doesnt help either lole
  but you literally have a normal looking nose your bridge is even nicely swooped and your nostrils arent huge morseso on the side of average contouring is the only other option just try to practice different methods of application color patterning or etc imo i think that its just a spot youre insecure about and your brain is blowing it out of proportion
  i see what you mean the shadow in pic is pretty nasty  from my experience contouring can mostly accent your features but not hide them  but if this is something that youre really insecure about most health insurances cover plastic surgery if youre under 21 at least they do where i live  ive gotten a nosejob myself and its pretty risk free so maybe its something to look into sorry for the lack of makeup advise but ive never heard anyone talk about nose makeup stuff before
  the eve spiners method sounds better to be honest
  what are these two things called  a giantass leather belt buckle under two belts and a kilt
  circle then youll get that nice poof
  fix those lips first girl jfc
  late response but thank you so so so much i would die for you anon i really appreciate this
    a girdle and a skirt you might from that apron is also appropriate for the kilt thing     but the belt thing is totally a girdle
  i forgot about evelynns lashers thank you for reminding me i can use/modify tutorials for those
  i cosplayed a onearmed character also missing their right hand earlier this year and was a little surprised at how obnoxious it was to not have my dominant hand for anything from checking my phone to getting a drink of water      yeah thats what im planning to do  i got a spirit chainsaw and everything should be pretty easy to take off but id wager if it was on my left hand i could further minimize the need to remove it    i guess my reasoning is that the chainsaws not symmetrical  the ripcord and the handle are on the left for easy access with the remaining hand  and that would affect the build  i suppose if someones enough of a prick to tell me im wrong i can always just tell them im mirror ash 
how do i get the collar of a trench coat to stay upright
  spray starch
  interfacing
i am very new to cosplay this is my first one and im working on a cosplay for a con i have been invited to pic related is what i would like to replicate and ive bought almost everything i need already i would really appreciate a little help from you more knowledgeable cosplayers    what blood is best to use for cosplays you intend to reuse a few times i want it to last and not attract any creepy crawlies into my house so i know the corn syrup ones are a nogo  how should i go about increasing my height i am 6162 and i have some thick work boots that should boost me up to 64 but if at all possible id like to go higher any recommendations maybe something i can put under my feet inside the shoes  how to conceal or otherwise hide belly i am very slightly overweight and i know if i can just wrap it in with something it will be much better   many thanks for any answers you might have
  i know the corn syrup ones are a nogo  every recipe i know has some variation of sugar whether cocoa powder koolaid or food coloring maybe food coloring water and corn starch either youre gonna have to buy a bottle of fx blood or do some at home tests
  how to conceal or otherwise hide belly  spanx in the mesh short variety or skintight athletic shorts like bikers wear
what a good website to get a petticoat for plus sizes my friend uses one for a lot of love live and i wanted to get them a new one
    many thanks lads
  most petticoats have a wide range of size variety when it comes to their stretch but if theyre really that big of a landwhale they can get something custom from melikestea if ur in the us malco mode can a variety of plus sizes as well
could i pull off golden age guts if im not that buff yet im it looks like a pretty good entry level armor cosplay
very stupid question but i received a long 1m light pink wig and idk who to do with it suggestions
  google pink hair anime girls youll have miles of suggestions or go to the havent seen this in a while thread for suggestions specific to your body type
i found pic related on amazon last night while half asleep and think it would be perfect for my for honor conqueror cosplay but i cant find it anymore or any alternative ones what do
  
  if youre worried about looking too skinny maybe you could do preband of the hawk guts
got my first skin tight costume what should i wear underneath to a hide any unsightly bulges and b wont give noticeable lines like underwear does
  another tighter bodysuit
  well shit ok
   this anon is right to some degree youll need to buy spanx of some sort to wear underneath theres the shorts or shorts  tank top variety that should work well with a bodysuit try to shoot for the seamless variety tbh even the seamless ones will still show though a skin tight bodysuit but itll be better than buying a thickly hemmed one much luck stores like macys and target sell them
    i want to thank you two for the great advice went as rob lucci and got my nails done as well the paint took 6 and a half hours to do but it was worth it i want to improve on this for the next time i do this so any advice at all would be appreciated i was thinking of getting a bald cap  wig for longer hair but my hair is already pretty long as it is
  im compelled to cosplay mei hatsume only to do a take on the wig      ive came up with a few approaches but id to know which people would think would look the best i can either and faux loc extensions in or sew loc extensions to a wig cap middle pic       im also split on what kinda material to use i was thinking either yarn kanekelon or marley hair
is the mehron creamblend stick good when it comes to doing homestuck troll makeup its really hard to find shit in the uk that isnt snazaroo
/cgl/ at what age did you start cosplaying
  16
  11
  nicely done your hard work definitely shows through in the final product
  technically 13 but smudged eyeliner and a backwards white shirt with a hunch doesnt really constitute a cosplay i didnt wear an honest to god costume until 21
  go for ben nye its available in the uk and its another high recommendation
anyone here cosplay crocodile im looking to just buy his hook however i dont want something not con safe metal or looks good on the product page but comes out a paper mache mess ideally itd be blunted plastic but i honestly dont know whos a bad seller and whos good
  this year 20 years old    i wanted to start far earlier but i didnt really have the means and skills to make a costume until i got out of home    it feels kinda bad i often wonder whether im too old for anime cons and cosplaying and all of this even though people sometimes suspect that im underage so its not that bad i guess
  if anything i can hook you up with a person who can make that for you i know a crocodile cosplayer that i met at animenyc last year and this year
  got any pictures preferably hallway shots but still
does anyone know where i can find or how i can make a shirt with cartoonishly large cuffs like this
  if you can into pattern making just modify a cuff to enlarge it with added interfacing perhaps a few tacs to keep it upright if it flops any
  i got them in my laptop but my friends that make props can easily maken you both the hook and the poison needle inside the hook pic related is all hand made   
  neat whats the best way to get in contact    tfw email field is kill
im going to be attempting a hue dream costume that has a fuckton of lace and because its all a really specific style im probably going to have to cobble my own lace appliqués together into a frankenappliqué aside from aliexpress ebay and cheep trims does anyone have any other stores theyd recommend for nice lace like the venise lace attached that i can buy in bulk that wont wreck my bank account please no taobao recommendations because try as i might i cannot get that shit to work
  their instagram is outlaw2lk same as his facebook name
  thank you very much
how tf do i get this hair without having a wig on i have a general idea of how to do the uv hair dye but my hair is thin and doesnt hold volume too well could i add extensions or something
  just wear a wig
how do i display brown characters if im not brown
im not sure if this is even the right board to ask this but currently i want to make an iron man suit the body has been designed out my main problem is the helmet i want to be able to see with the helmet closed is there a way to see through the helmet without poking holes through it
  getting a nice tan helps out tremendously body paint can also work too
  use a lot of gel for the spikes
  less worried about spikes more the gravity defying part
    natural tan yes body paint absolutely fucking do not
how the hell do i keep my long twintails from tangling terribly from walking ten feet at a con i am at such a loss recently brought back my miku cosplay i used to wear in 2011 and got a new wig that is about as long on me as it is on this chick my old wig was more like midtorso and curly and it was much easier for me to care for at the con my new straight one got so nasty i combed it out fine but how do i keep it from getting so bad at cons i felt embarrassed getting my photo taken i tried tying the ends in a hair tie and that didnt work then the middle got tangled i tried holding them in my hands to keep them out of trouble but then that part i was holding got tangled i ended up having to cut out a big mat and felt really dumb for not figuring this out so call me an idiot but how can this go better next time at a con
  silicone spray
  thanks anon ill look into it might be my savior next con
  oh sweet summer child youre far from too old the most prolific cosplayers in the community are like 10 years older and theyll continue to cosplay far beyond that
  your local fabric store try to look for a nonchain store and theyll typically have good prices
  tease it hairspray gel its going to be a bitch to comb out after youre done and honestly itd be easier just to buy a wig
  translucent plastic you can dye it or use something akin to a 1 way mirror i wouldnt be able to tell you how to do that though
newbie question   i want to buy my first cosplay for relatively cheap would ebay be a good way i saw some stores located around eu belgium and germany mainly but they look like stuff i saw on aliexpress are they just costume resellers with inflated prices   tfw living in eu and having 50 tax
fabric recommendations for the pink should i get stretch fabric like some thick knit something stiffer like a canvasy material  also a tutorial for the trim that goes around the hood would be appreciated
  thank you so much i didnt expect my lucci to blow up this big because bandai  vizmedia crunchyroll and funimation shouted me out and offered me jobs there as well as blew up on ig its an amazing experience and the 6 and a half hours  3 days of no sleep was worth it again thank you so much for the compliment since this is a help thread is there anything i can do to improve on this cosplay any suggestions and advice would be most appreciated and ill use it for next time
  theres a seller people buy from that uses a pleather like material its very neat surprisingly the shining on the renders make it hard to tell exactly what its supposed to be like how the robes now look like rubber but id say a faux leather would give it that thickness and cushion like puff at the seams
hey pals have any of you wanted some simple custom electronics for your projects like leds touch flex sensors sound effects as an electronics student i was thinking of making some custom electronics related to cosplay any ideas
  if you feel comfortable with it definitely buy from taobao i got a cosplay for 40 that cost 150 on aliexpress
    i agree body paint would look good for something like red or green skin but for a character like that people would probably accuse me of natural tan isnt really practical either so i think ill just be safe and deal with being a little inaccurate this time
    hi i did stuff like this for my helmet you have a couple of options     the easiest way is to have the eyes of the helmet filled in with a thin plastic like petg very cheap and easy to work with at 002 thickness that you apply coloration to i did mine black and i found that while dye worked it was messy and prone to failure by ending up gross looking and uneven window tint filmvery easy to apply turned out much better     a quick google search confirms that white window tint is a thing so 23 players of that with at least one layer on each side of the plastic and you should be good     you might have to get more fancy if you want they eyes to light up but i dont know if thats you plan anyway if it is your plan i think you just could go around the outside of the eyeplastic with some el wire that lights up when you turn it on and that should give you a lightupeye effect without fucking blinding you but i have not done that myself so i cannot confirm     otherwise instead of plastic you can use a white mesh to fill in the eyes instead think like how those halloween grim reaper masks work but a white cloth instead of a black one i could not reccommend you a specific fabric for the task as i have not done that
whats the best way to do this dress with someone that is a basic sewing bitch cutting 2 dresses in half then sewing them together  zipper
  the petg doesnt sound like a bad idea do you think it will work for pla or abs
  absolutely theres a market for everything i think you just have to find the right characters to make props for open commissions obviously but try to gain traction by selling specific products dr stranges weapons iron mans weapons thors hammer w/ actual thunder super saiyan glowing wigs etc etc any magic or technology using characters are fair game i look forward to seeing your stuff anon
  yes but youre going to need some interfacing at the top to make the collar stiff  dont worry though theres easy iron on stuff itll be expensive to buy trim that big so try to look for some cheap alternatives like a feather boa or something good luck anon
  thanks you but the thing is im trying to find ideas for the electronics part ant not the prop part i suck at it    like for example a simple sensor that you could place at the end of a hammer when the sensor activates you hit something a sound effect comes out    i want to create the electronics part that can be used in a lot of projects and just be adaptable    just looking for ideas and if i wanted to sell such things where could i i know places on facebook and /cgl/ buy sell trade general any others
  i think you have the ideas part down pat do some research into existing cosplay props and look for the common threads that your future product could string together as for places its best not to pigeonhole yourself into a single one but branch out all over the place start a facebook page broadcast into commission groups have an etsy / storenvy / tictail / or ig storefront the /cgl/ bts is too small for the amount of revenue youre going to want for your work in the long run start off there sure but do try to move beyond it uploading wips and videos of your products in motion will definitely draw attention just use the right hashtags and posting schedule a google search should bring up all that info for you
a little off topic but i dont know where else to ask how do you anons come up with handle names i have really poor naming sense and can never come up with a good name
  i used to spitball them with my friends mine was eventually inspired by a badge blunder where instead of putting my name and then my chosen badge name they put my badge name three times at that point there was no turning back and i just evolved it into my final name      a good point is to not steal a name from a somewhat famous cosplayer at a recent con i went to i was excited to see rufflebutt cosplay on a list of contestants only to realize well jessie probably wasnt actually there disappointment
    seconded i would go with a thin pleather not the fleece lined upholstery stuff wax paper is your friend when you sew that stuff
  i used to cosplay yoko with a similarly long clip in ponytail i would just bring a comb with me to the con and every hour or so would step into a bathroom/side hallway and comb it out     silicon spray kept it from getting to ratty initially but the maintenance throughout the day also definitely helped  a lot easier and less damaging to clean out small tangles multiple times as opposed to the big mess at the end of the day
  thanks
  this may sound weeby but i chose my name based on a character from a childhood anime i liked  my favourite mythological animal that way it should end up being something simple people can remember yet something youre not gonna hate at the same time
what character/series should i cosplay if i want to fuck huge tiddy nonlandwhale cosplayers
  can i stick my pp in u
  they look like lfairy super crystal blue
trying to get more into foamwork for armor and props anyone have any spicy resource reccs    ive already checked out punished props and evil ted on youtube and they help a ton also been looking at other misc videos on youtube/looking at info online but i want to hear from some of you guys that are more experienced than me ive made a prop so far and its been alright simple sword with a crappy wooden core but i want to make sure i learn it right
  it honestly makes me wonder how boobjobs can still look so bad in 2018 you can implant your own fat into your butt why is the same for breasts not fully possible yet
  kamuicosplay
  i want to make a mask /cgl/ or potentially a helmet with some sort of face visor i can paint havent got much experience in cosplaying but i have experience in making things and can pretty much throw money at whatever project i decide i like     so what are my options in terms of methods for making a helmet or mask the better looking the better the first id like to make has a skull on it for a costume im working on but im happy to make a simple/practise one first if that would help me      anybody got ideas looking for something a few cuts above the ol paper mache
im a nigger and didnt check the catalog for help    but does anyone know how i could attach punk spikes to the crown of a lycra suit without puncturing the material i thought of strong adhesive magnets but idk if theyll stay
  sew on snaps you could hot glue it to the leather or stud and sew it on through the lycra use a thin needle just in case but it shouldnt leave any holes in it you are technically going to have to puncture the suit but theyre extremely minor and its your best bet
okay so i want to do golden age guts as my first armor build i was wondering which pieces of the armor i should use the thick floor tile eva foam and which parts i should use craft foam im assuming the chestplate should be the thicker eva and everything else should be craft foam also i was initially planning on doing the saran wrap  duct tape method but upon looking at it again i think it might be a be a bit too simple for that what do /cgl/
  i recently used the duct tape method for the first time and while its useful you cant rely on it alone i made the mistake of trying to do it myself which also impeded the process but even without making that same mistake youll still want to transfer it to paper and double check the measurements here and there making a draft also helps tremendously ill leave the thickness question to someone else though as im not adept with it
  duct tape method isnt necessary thats mostly rectangular pieces if you flatten it out i would use 68mm foam for the entire thing buy from tnt or whatever to get the big sheets anything thicker than 8mm is really only good for stuff like halo armor where you need rigid geometric pieces if its too thick you cant easily heat form the pieces which is a useful process for medieval looking metal armor
im wearing a bodysuit for an upcoming convention but im afraid of bra and underwear printing through the suit material     any ideas of what i can to to prevent it or should i skip undergarments altogether
does anyone have any advice for a pattern that would work for midare toushirous dress or would it be better to just try and make one myself
any way i can find a similar outfit
   seamless micro fibre thong and pasties depending on thickness of fabric   what i would do
  a uniform surplus store
      pasties will print through most bodysuit fabric and spandex depending on the thickness its very unsightly and distracting same with most thongs if you can get away with not using them do that
what kind of lenses could i use for white diamond should i go for mesh ones or just white ones
  mesh are easier to see out of white will give you a shorter wear time
  mesh will look better because her irises are grey not white
    okay ill go with the mesh ones instead thanks for the advice
im gonna be doing a froppy cosplay soon i have the proper wig but how the fuck do you make her hair bow bullshit ive tried searching it up and i get mixed answers
  theres many ways to skin this cat but for my cosplay i carved a piece of styrofoam covered it in green felt and then glued down wefts    heres my wisdom  spray adhesive is too tacky it will clot and pull hairs up resulting a horrible mess maybe use a brush and school glue instead  got2b glued freeze spray works great to keep everything looking neat but you cant rely on it for adhesive alone  comb frequently  most importantly make sure to add a method of attachment before putting on the wefts i screwed myself over with this  before gluing down pin the wefts to the styrofoam to test the way youd like to wrap it again theres several ways to do it but youll have to go with what pleases you aesthetically  use a low temp heat gun  give yourself plenty of time it takes longer than youd imagine to do this process    good luck post pics of your process if you need more help
what should i search for to find this style of dress specifically a flat color with a print on the edge
are the wigs on yesstyle any good thinking of getting this one for a splatoon pearl cosplay but if their other wigs are decent id buy some more for lolita i know they carry multiple brands are any of them particularly good or bad  
  do you have any pictures of the dress itself its hard to tell with the overcoats
looking for suggestions on what i could cosplay effectively with my type of face  any type of character suggestion is appreciated
  
    theres a thread for that
  google is useless because its all sponsored youtube hauls i just want a fellow gulls honest opinion
does anyone know where i can find metallic knit fabric in turquoise ive looked everywhere and i cant seem to find it
  unfortunately i cant find any pictures of her in that outfit without the shawl on the style of the sleeves and neckline are pretty much irrelevant since theyre not normally visible though i would take a guess that its a long or medium sleeved dress kinda like a nightgown    upon further searching im pretty sure what im looking for is a border print casual dress but its hard to find border print garments that are primarily a solid color what i think im gonna do is get a solid color dress and apply the border print by hand for accuracy
  like spandex theres a ton on aliexpress
  foam check punished props on youtube for all the foam wisdom youll ever need
          
  i was just about to suggest the same good luck anon
      thank you for sending the links but i meant metallic knit not spandex i think its also known as lurex or glitter jersey  the texture is like rough knitted plastic     i dont know if there are any other names for it but ive tried aliexpress etsy and ebay and i cant find it in that color
    whoops i tagged the wrong post
  have you tried visiting any local stores if any that arent joans theres textile shops here in my city but they dont have websites and i know for sure one of them would have that
  yeah i think ill have to look for it in a local fabric store that was my last option since i was trying to keep costs down
id like to learn how to make jewelry namely working with metal and stones so i can make some acessories for a cosplay project    does anyone have a pointer on where to start learning     thank you
  id look into local classes these are pretty specific techniques and when youre working with metal and stones id want someone there who knows what theyre doing
  im not a cosplayer so i dont really know but i googled turquoise lurex and found this 
  sorry for the late reply but would you suggest interfacing before or after sewing the dress together
  nayrt but definitely before youll risk having lumpy uneven interfacing if you do it after you sew the dress
where do i even start with a wig like this should i just tease the fuck out of one make a foamcore and build around it something else entirely
  i will do that thank you i also suppose you need a series of tools that will not be easy to find or cheap i was hoping i could look up some tutorials first to know what im looking at beforehand     likes to study before class
  you could try with yarn
  id go with a foam core if you made this in all fiber it would be really heavy
  oh my gosh i think thats the closest to what im looking for  ill look through local stores first to see if i can find anything closer but if not then now i know where to buy it   thank you
  a little of both youll want to use the upside down duck butt method as shown here  apologies for the rebloggy link i lost the original and this is what google gave me   secure wig to foam head and flip upside down  use hairdryer and hair spray intermittently to fluff up the wig especially at the roots leaving overnight to allow the fibers to relax into this new form   make sure to set aside the side burn sections  flip right side up going around the circumference of the wig start parting the wig into 2 sections for each handful of hair the inner section closest to the center of the wig should be fuller than the outer section 25/75 split  insert your foamcore now if youd like to go that route but remember to be careful with your hairdryer as it could melt the foam  tease the fuck out of the inner 75 section again hair spray and dry to build upwards  comb the outer section to your desired look and hairspray it to the teased inner section this outer section will hide the teased mess and should be the only part visible see spiking tutorials on youtube for a visual guide  youre done    consider adding some very light paint to the bottom of the wig to cast a realistic shadow its optional but it might make your wig look more realistic just a thought  good luck
ill be cosplaying as mandy from the grim adventures of billy and mandy to a con in april ive never styled a wig before whats the best way to go about styling a short blonde wig to look like her hair im highkey dreading it
  its not as hard as you think the fine details are hidden by the mass amount of strands in wig i did a major style for the first time last year and felt the same concerns until i just leapt in and did it i doubt youll need to do much cutting but youll definitely need to brush hairspray and blow drying youre essentially following a tutorial like this  but making two large spikes remember that you can wash out whatever you do to the wig so dont feel too much pressure
  you can also use rigid collodion dont get it in/around your eyes        dude awesome great to see some op love i think a wig would be great for the volume though you could cut it and affix it as a hairpiece to your real hair if you preferred to skip the bald cap part but full on prosthetic work would be cool to see youd be able to hide your real ears if you used a wig and then attach cat ears either in the hairline or on top of the bald cap depends if you can blend it    either way this made me really happy to see great job      i was 17 i think       ive got no answers for you but im eagerly lurking to see the finished cosplay
  11    its good but it is oil based so if youve got shitty skin be forewarned
planning to start working on this dood soon specifically his robe under the armor at this point in time wanted to check to make sure im not totally color blind/retardo    so his concept art pic has him wear a very dark navy but the fgo art and practically all of the cosplays ive seen of him has a much brighter shimmery fabric i looked at several outfits theyre selling online and theyre all very bright hence the confusion would it be dark navy or a brighter more vivid color im trying to make him as original saber ie practically a genderbend as possible so as similar to the og design i guess    additionally not really sure if its supposed to be silver trim or white trim     finally im trying to envision what type of material the cloth would be it would make sense for it to be broadcloth/canvasy type ie middle ages king hardy combat robes but i can also see it as being satin what would be the right call here gulls
  pick whichever shade of blue suits your skintone the best as for fabric try going with a sateen or a cotton that has some sheen to it hes definitely not wearing satin though   gl anon im making gawain right now so we can suffer together in camelot hell
  og saber is royal blue not navy so if you want to stick to looking like that go with royal blue   as for the fabric the obvious choice based on the time period and the fact that he would have been in britain would be wool however this can be pretty warm depending on where you are i used a linen blend for my og saber and im pretty happy with how it turned out i feel like using satin or velvet for a battle costume is out of place considering theyre also wearing armor
i need some advice regarding catherines eyeshadow the artbook states her and vincents designs were influenced by buffalo 66 should i go with a sparkly eyeshadow true to riccis in the film or do something more toned down to match the actual game style
  for reference
  i personally think itd be more interesting to go off of what they were originally inspired by besides its one moment where its excusable to have a fun makeup look in cosplay
how could i do her upper arm/sleeves i dont mind if its not completely clear but i dont know how id do the little middle parts of the bulb around my arm    i cant find any plastic lightbulbs for the rest of her costume in the right color/size when i look online i find either glass or actual light bulbs
    so here is what i would do    for the bulbs on the hat and tail you are actually going to get clear plastic bottles of appropriate shape/size the ones on the feet being round you can probably do with clear plastic christmas ornaments intended for crafting and do the same tint these to the amber color you need there are a couple of different ways to do that look them up   the good news is that you dont need to see through them for visibility purposes like a visor so you can use methods that end up making light a little blurry and still be fine for your purpose i think the easiest way is a mixture of food coloring and elmers glue painted on the inside in a thin layer     then you use wire to make the filament inside of the bottlebulbs     for the upper arm sleeves then what you do is that you have a dark cloth sleeve that actually covers your arms with wire to make a flat version of the filament design that is glued to/printed on the arm sleeve so the filament is a brighter distinct shape on the dark colored sleeve drawing the eye     then you use a clear plastic to make the puff part and tint it like you did the bottles designed to go over the sleeve and cover it/connect with the shoulder this will give the effect of the shoulder being visually very similar to the bulbs including a filament the only difference is that there isnt empty space between the filament and your torso    thats the best solution i can think of
does anyone have tips or experience making something like this neck puff i want it to hold that nice heart shape and be comfortable as a separate costume piece     id also love faux fur recommendations since im shopping online
does anyone have good suggestions for eye contacts that would suit diamond im pretty stumped i havent been able to find anything yet i feel like would work well
  luna prism or danna 7con
  ah those are perfect thank you
  great ideas thanks anon
how would i make a ponytail this big would it just be too heavy no matter what i do
  its going to have some heft to it because of the sheer volume of hair but after awhile you wont really notice it use a foam core to bump up the ponytail and tease the top to really give it that oomph i strongly recommend using something to anchor the ponytail to the wig since itll be so heavy like snaps or a wire or something i also recommend adding sewin combs to the inside of the wig at various spots around your head in addition to bobby pins to keep it secure i tried to only use bobby pins with a waist length wig and that shit was slipping like butter in a hot pan also braid your hair underneath your wig cap ponytails arent gonna cut it
hi guys new here a couple of weeks ago i shaved myself bald but i kept my hair because i wanted to make a wig from it i have all of my basic wigmaking supplies and now all i have to do is make it problem is though i have no idea how to attach the hair a lace wig base is needed for my hair and most of the tutorials i found say to hot glue the hair to the base but that doesnt sound sturdy i want a good wig im aware i need to sow it together but no good videos exist of it advice and help
  responding to my own post dont mind me  i found the tutorials page on here sorry for wasting a thread space

    fellas
current cosplay me and my boyfriend has been working on
  what is it a cosplay of
  is that a confederate flag on your hat
  waifu operator
  i was going to say it was a novorossian flag which isnt really all that better but yeah thats deadass a confederate flag
working on a xof cosplay right now because i love the fuck out of their uniform trying to decide whether i should get one of the german bluegray coveralls or the miltec gray ones i feel like the german ones will be higher quality i just dont want to go through the effort of finding one in size too fucking tall      greyshop    alright this has to stop         proper term is a rebel flag confederate national flag is different rebel flag is the naval jack of the confederacy
  i actually did cosplay with my gear at the last mega con ill send pics when i get home      its a pvc confederate flag that i have for shits and giggles old pic related
  op better put varustelekacom on that pastebin its one of the biggest and best surp and non surp sellers in europe if not the world    very likely going to run a military cosplay to my september con with my so just because i cant be bothered to put something more elaborate together and were both volunteering will post when that happens
  american flags on gear  but also rebel flags  edgy
  edgy
  tbh it was for a threeper picture
  proper term is a rebel flag  right right even so i dont care about it but some people might feel strongly
as promised
  thank you
  whats wrong with greyshop
  i mean better than the super expensive shit on ebay surely       that is some oc shit and not a cosplay is it      literally what the fuck is that supposed to be thats not cosplay get that shit in /k/ or something
  theyre overpriced jews and they take ages to ship    just get on some fb buying forums
  there are 3 cosplays in that picture
gq is fucked yo we need to let it be dead for 3 months and then it will rise back to its original glory    yes i say this as i bump the thread
  you know exactly what im talking about dont pretend you dont
  all overpriced and more importantly most of the stuff they sell even the stuff that they claim to be used by the military is commercial spec for example their 6sh122 ratnik suits are a different cut from the ones used by the russian military       unless youre going to provide what your cosplay is im gonna go ahead and say youve got rem  ram and then your standard shooting kit
  nayrt but they have a viridian forest ranger patch and a pokemon/pokeball attached to their gear    so i mean its a lazy as fuck cosplay but they did tack on something other than generic airshit its technically generic pokemon themed airshit
  ages to ship   nigga i got my shit in 2 and half weeks
hi     i just want to cosplay the airsoft guns are out of my budget is there a used/asis/broken marketplace that i could find a prop for cheaper
  many airsoft stores have a boneyard section where they sell broken/returned/floor model guns at discounted prices from there you could either fill the gun with expanding foam to deactivate it or use it for castings   you can also use ebay and just look up broken/boneyard
i have 2 gorka suits first is non camo version second is camo what cosplay can i use them in 
   your only option is pretty much the fsb operators from siege i was going to say maybe the vdv from mgsv but they wear afghankas
    oh and the sunrise suit from stalker is based around a gorka if youre willing to do some sewing for the vest
  where exactly do you get face masks that cover a wider area    i dont like how the standard flu mask exposes the sides of your face
    thanks
    this looks promising
  pretending to be military is cosplay anon gear queers dont like to admit that though
  looks like artels work so nice
  its cosplaying as a tryhard who wishes they didnt get unqed at meps for pot
any rainbow here im the buck
anyone have experiencing diying a harness im hoping to cosplay a diamond dogs soldier and a spie harness seems quite pricey what equipment do i need to replicate something like that
  sorry that picture doesnt really highlight it
best place to buy a replica stabo harness dont want to spend hundreds in ausbucks for what is meant to be my budget cosplay
how hard would this be to create i have a sewing machine but not much experience i also have no clue where to find the triangle buckle any help would be amazing
fellas im looking for a vest similar to leons here but im not quite sure what i should be looking for ignore sora this is honestly like the only clear reference pic i could find
  something an hgu56p helmet and maxillofacial shield
  left one has really swollen legs for someone her age seriously not being an ass she should get herself checked out that amount of water retention in her legs for her weight is nor normal
might be the only place to ask but anyone have pics of a few military lolitas as well was looking for the ghillie suit inspired one in particular
  diying isnt hard at all just requires a little bit of sewing
  i got a very good mk14 ebr replica off of amazon for 35 that fooled some other military cosplayers into thinking it was a real airsoft gun look for the chinese knockoff toys
  i met big boss himself he signed my patriot ive been over the moon for the last week
im brand new to this but seeing this pic is the prime reason im getting into it
anyone know of anywhere i could get a jacket like this in red
  fucking weeb shit
does anyone know what kind of buckle this is
  you can find a ton of them on amazon by typing in belt quick release its quite common
what kind of rig/backpack is the mgs merc is wearing    also are there any other terms for the camo i couldnt find the exact pattern anywhere
    the mgs wiki is your friend
  my thread got deleted for obvious reasons so i will repost here    so halloween is coming up quick and usually i am something zombiethemed i was thinking this year i could be a zombie nazi and apparently there is a movie called dead snow that has zombie nazis in it i havent seen it yet anyways what gear do i need to acquire between now and halloween to achieve this goal im thinking either zombie ss officer because i like the hat or just a regular ground troop whatever they were called because i think the hat or that helmet would be easy to find    ps im not an actual nazi
  ps im not an actual nazi  actual nazi plz go
  actual nazi here dont listen to   you can stay    as far as helmets go you can buy replica stahlhelms but modern pasgt helmet replicas are basically the same design and way cheaper    jackboots you can find on ebay for 30 bucks
  nice ill have to check it out i really want to do this not sure if i want to get a uniform just to fuck it up for example i made bp and used it on my pirate zombie costume to give it that certain look of being shot up close with a pistol put blood around the scorch mark was really a lot of fun but if i do this one i probably will just do my face and no ruin the uniform i have a paper cutting machine so i can cut any stencils of emblems out to spray paint on the helmet if needed
  check out pasgt replica helm  yeah i guess it kind of looks like the stahlhelm  look at stahlhelm price  wow that pasgt is looking pretty good
  rd54 is the backpack the camo is ttsko butan camo very hard to find i just dyed some rothco urban bdus
do you rike it
  pretty good
  its not over yet
  youre pretty good   better than mine  i think l put those same gloves with mine
      greetings fellow ocelots nice job on you both we may all three have the same gloves i am still looking for a big boss cosplayer to shoot with though
  p gud     only thing you could still do is give the uniform a slight dust weathering makes the colors shine a bit less
where my fsb boyes at
do you guys make your own helmets or do you buy them  if so any tips for making helmets i really want to make a demonica but ive never done this shit and a helmet as hard as this seems like itd be hard this also has no pdo files on it    seems like this would be the right place to ask considering the demonica itself is military gear
  green cryes  sig sauer mcx   extended mags    do i know you
  nigga i got my shit in three times as long as it takes for other people to ship  
  what should i look for if i want leons radio a non working one that looks fairly similar is what im looking for
  i just see a ptt you can get those cheap on aliexpress
  ive been wondering if it is possible to import resin kits of pistols like this one to canada   will the customs seize it or let it pass its also in two pieces so i dont know if it helps my chances of it being allowed into the country can a fellow canuck give me some insight on this
  if it was brightly colored or something i wouldnt see a problem but back when i wanted to visit canada i texted their firearms and customs bureau about my cardboard dp28 and they said that it was technically illegal lmao
does anyone know what specific officer uniform big boss wears at the end of mgs 3 and where i can get a replica of it
  looks like the armys green class a service uniform devoid of everything except his service ribbons he has a green beret with a fox patch and his pants are tucked into his jump boots
  pasgt helmet  basically the same thing  theyre just not though are they
  cobra buckle
  came here from /k/ to help a friend find cosplay shit is this related to yalls larping general this is where you came from it all makes sense now
    
any other canadians here im looking to do a mgs3 snake cosplay generic i know but i have no idea where to start looking for gear most things on here are american and cost a fuckton of money to have sent over here/converted from usd to cad anyone got some good websites they know of
  first post on /cgl/ help a /k/ommando find military uniform patterns    i have this one and a japanese pattern translation guide to go with it it covers some basic jackets      im looking more specifically for bdu style soldier uniforms    picture related australian bush outfit have a flight suit pattern im going to make out of of russian partizan camo for a stalker larp
  that looks absolutely amazing im gushing at it
  just dont be cheap
  wait a second is that an acog what are you doing
  dont tell ubi
im new to cosplay/costuming and im looking for some advice on creating the chest piece in pic related i was thinking of using 1/8th thick aluminum and painting it green but im not sure what it would look like    tldr how do i make good looking armor for cheap
    anyone know of a pattern to sew the knee pads on the sunrise pants
  nice what did you use to make your patriot
   where do u see swell
my first stalker inspired cosplay didnt base it on any specific faction or npc but i pulled some random gear together because i think that is what loners would do in the survivalist scenario of the zone   wish i added more mud and blood but im happy with the result
  looks pretty good senpai
  could also be loose skin
  is good but i cant help but notice the hole in your pants
      this looks very close
ive been planning a krupinski cosplay for a while now and im not completely sure what the real world equivalent of her jacket would be would i be right in guessing that its a blue lufftwaffe jacket circa 1945ish or would it be the plain wool tunic i just wanted to double check so i could find the right pattern or perhaps alter an existing one if i could get my hands on it as for the rest of her outfit i should be able to sort that out easily
  try again another day and itll probably be legal rcmp typically dont know shit about the rules rules are vague as fuck cfos arent on the same page when you phone the cfo is actually civilian acting like they know more than you and usually they dont but you still have to follow their inconsistent rules cause they arent accountable for anything  ive seen rubber guns for training in stores here and deactivated guns arent considered guns anymore
  i dont understand leaves man
    
im doing cipher galm 1 from ace combat zero this weekend kind of wish i had planned it out better
  looks more metro 2033ish desu
i working and collecting on a eastgerman nva nationale volksarmee soldier costume the whole equipment is original
r8 my rosn    couldnt find my mechanix so i just wore my motorcycle gloves xd
   yo buddy still alive 
would there be any r6 cosplays that could be done without contacts i recall pulse having a skin with normal glasses but that might be a little too obscure
  how bad is your eyesight without glasses
  possibly ash if you had prescription sunglasses the first time i went to a con as jager i was wearing my glasses it worked fine but they got steamed up whenever i had my visor down
  6/65 so pretty trash    i can see shapes but nothing super clear unless im right next to it i could also probably get a pair of sunglasses that would go around the normal glasses for pulse but that wouldnt look too great      im a guy and i probably cant pull off a crossplay
  my guy theyre like 30 burgerbux on amazon  still turned out fine though
    pretty sure i saw the guy with cosplaying blitz at tac city a while back he was a real fat fuck
anyone know what the clear sky camo is based on
  wait is this warsaw comiccon ive seen this russian guy from the middle before
where should i look to order a decent quality maroon beret
  good
  its supposed to be the old army service uniform but it looks closer to the current marine corps service alpha uniform
  heres the actual uniform item worn by paratroopers or jumpqualified members of airborne units     no its not stolen valor    
  that plane is hilarious
hey guys my friend and i are doing ela and dokkaebi next year  anyone know what pieces dokkaebi uses outfit wise thanks
anyone looking for an xof cvc
old one    has reached bump limit post all discord stuff here
i was thinking about creating a sfw discord server aimed at people who feel lonely or would like to make new friends it wouldnt be focused on lolita cosplay japanese culture etc but it would be for people with these interests people could share everyday pics thoughts and more generally chat with others about whatever staying anonymous would also be okay as long as the user takes part into the conversation    the server would have different private channels and every channel would be restricted to 510 individuals who could access that only channel and not the others this way people could get to know each other after 23 months inactive users would be kicked not from the server only from the private channels the active ones would randomly be redistributed among the channels basically you would change channel thus getting to know new people and maybe remeeting old ones this method is inteded to make things a little more interesting and different people shouldnt exchange contacts to chat on other platforms at least not from the start    i think this would be fun especially if you dont have any irl friend that shares your interests i would need 1 mod  at least 4 other people per private channel i think the discord can be opened with at least 2 private channels so 10 people but more would be better id also need some civility i dont like drama     if you are interested send me your discord username here  dont worry i wont be able to get any other info about you     when/if i get 10 people in ill open the server and get back to you
oh great another thread for xforcedmemex420 to bitch in
  who
  she was in the last thread making the 15th vetted discord because the other ones arent up to her standards eyeroll
  i liked the idea until you started saying things like randomly assigning people to a room that they could only join with the other people randomly assigned to that room sounds like the clusterfuck of high school teachers that randomly assigned people to a group for a project just let people get to know everyone there not every one is going to feel comfortable with everyone and its going to feel more like a chore than fun
  its xforcedmeme420x    and yeah fuck that bitch
  you mean that wasnt a crossboarder damn i thought it was some dude trolling
  why does she like bees so much
  this sounds like an extremely bad idea anon zero interest in that
i already got some responses but please remember to add the numbers after your username otherwise i dont think i can find you c       something like that sounds very general i think it might already exist ive added a section to the form anyway you can now add only if no random system or something like that there if most people dont want it i will create a normal server     also im not sure whether people were referring to me but im not forcedmeme
  yeah i agree down with meme i hear theyre a tranny from australia
  you could give it a try but scrach the idea of packing 10 random people into a room thats not gonna work
  i hate australia i hate australia so goddamn much one time australia collectively pissed on my brand and i will never forgive them i hate asutralia
  i heard meme once ordered an entire bag of dicks off aliexpress and sucked them all
  what is wrong with australians
are there any that have people who can hold actual conversation id like to make more friends in the community but it feels like whenever i join one its screaming over memes and videogames which is fun and all but id like to actually get to know people
    all they ever fucking talk about is ghost night bride
can someone repost the list with invites that dont expire
  dream dresses die in australia
  meme does not have a peepee and she lives in london you dumbasses
  try submitting your username to the form i posted here  if you feel like it i cant assure you how people will behave but i also dont like constant shitposting and memes
  i would but i dont like the idea of being stuffed into smaller groups why cant it just be open maybe have small membercapped rooms that people can join for smaller convos if they want but keep a main room open where everyone is
  ive been out of touch with the discords for a while but i thought she was just fine with the one and only vetted discord      bees are literally the best how dare you
  heshe once sent me a picture of their dick with the bee movie script tattooed on the shaft tranny confirmed
  honestly idk if theyre a dedicated rper or what ive never seen them post a coord on the vetting discord but they seem to buy shit all the time like i doubt its a power grab but im suss about their reasons for creating the new elite discord
  shes posted coords before theres a search function on discord for that
  i dont post my coords on the discord is everyone who avoids adding their pictures to the cesspool a roleplayer now
  ive seen her irl and she forgot that she was wearing her fursuit head because she says she feels so united with her furself that she didnt even feel or notice it of course it was a bees head too /
  i met her once irl we went to a lunch meet she ordered spaghetti and took out a bottle of honey from her purse and squeezed out half the bottle onto the spaghetti and started mixing it in nobody else batted an eyelash so i didnt say anything but what the fuck
  i heard the body of her fursuit is an eight legged demonic porpoise
  i heard that her fursuit is to disguise the fact that she is actaully just a swarm of bees
does anyone know of an active invite to the vetted server i am in the other one but its mostly questions and i want more and i heard about that one so may i try it thanks
first day is tomorrow is anyone else going if so what will you be going as
terribly sad rn    planned for this event solely to get an autograph from izumi kitta and my mother lost the keys to the car
i dont know if anyone else here went but i felt like nearly all the cosplayers were pretty bad with the exception of the popipa/ revue starlight groups but those ladies always make awesome stuff it felt weird to me to see boku no hero rezero etc cosplay at an event that has nothing to do with nonbushiroad properties
  most of the revue starlight was pretty terrible from what i saw it was clear that 95 bought their costumes from china and china apparently cant tell colors why would you make claudine in light grey shes in navy in the anime and black in the stage show   a lot of anime is in the weiss card game that was there so maybe thats why
  uber taxi bus friend bike walking come on anon there are a million other options than your freaking mom driving you
  the same people who did popipa on the first day did the school uniforms on the second day and they looked nice but i agree that most of the girls in the stage outfits looked average there was a maya who looked nice though
its been awhile since the last craft thread  what have you gulls been working on   any new shops youve been admiring recently
christmas is coming i should begin to make brooches but im too lazy
  im going to be soon teaching a resin class at a local coffee/craft that i semiwork at its going to be a charity event for a local animal shelter so ive ordered a lot of animalshaped molds so everyone who comes can pick their own mold and create a cute pin to wear after they are done curing im also bringing glitter and rhinestones galore so they can customize everything when they come back in to get their pieces im hoping quite a few people come wish me luck gulls
  sorry i meant to reply to op
does anyone have a tutorial for a canotier i tried to make one myself and it turned out ugly
    how was it ugly i used to make them quite a bit for conventions and the main thing was getting the ruffles equally spaced out i kept a personal few for my own collection and i quite like them      is a pretty good tutorial from a glancei think the key is a strong base and a good eye for what is a good bouquet of flowers
  it was just way too bulky it looks a little like a tumor with how it sticks out of my head thanks for the link though ill check it out
  i wish there was that kind of classes where i live i would have come and supported you im more of an artist than a crafter and these threads are nice inspiration but im too lazy to work on a new skill over practicing drawing   good luck to you gull resin crafting seems fun and i hope its a success
  good luck anon that sounds super fun
anyone else in the resin scene sick of the entitlement of newbie crafters im so over seeing kids whinge and throw tantrums because someone who did something mildly unique wont share their technique/material source especially if theyre a shop  its not unreasonable to try and keep the one thing that differentiates you from the thousands of other resin shops using the same molds somewhat a secret
  i have a girl who regularly tries to harass me shell even ask on different profiles and when i click i see her main account linked in the bio like what the fuck    to clarify i dont super mind if people ask but dont throw a fit because i wont spoonfeed you
  yeah i dont mind saying oh its a pigment/holo foil or whatever or that i got something from aliexspress but ive had people hound me to give them links to every specific detail i added to a piece molds pearls pigment jewellery findings additional small charms even the keychain ffs and its like i dont even know you i get nothing out of this arrangement except you probably replicating what ive done and becoming competition but sure im a bitch because i wont give everything that could be found pretty easily if they bothered to do a cursory google search to strangers lol
ive been trying to find a good way to make simple hair bows and such nothing too fancy as im a beginner i have cheap scrap fabrics to practice with and i have yet to decide what to do about fraying edges maybe i could sew them or find some of that stuff that stops fraying considering hot glue bullshitting which has had mixed results for me before    someday i hope to get into resin i find a lot of nice videos on youtube that i like a lot    this channel has a ton of good ideas     and this isnt resin but it seems so easy ive considered trying it myself     if anybody has any tutorials pictures or otherwise thatd be lovely i myself would like to see more examples of bows maybe with lace or layers
  youre looking for fray check right
    just a quick fyi a lot of the taobao shops that produce tutorials like the pic you posted make it a point to use materials that wont fray for their fabric thats why they dont bother showing anything about the edges    the ribbon ends you can seal with candle flame a hot knife a spot of fray check/nail polish/lacquer/waterproof glue or fold it back and sew it
    the fabrics the shops use have fray check and theyre made of fake suede/polyester materials that have essentially been seared during production thats why they dont fray    if youre interested i think i might be able to pull a few shops with this fabric personally i like it a lot it produces a cuter more defined edge than lace that you can actually layer lace on top of
honestly i really love caramel ribbons designs so much she really inspires me to do a lot more with my resin creations i also really love the little heart gems she puts in the middle of most of her items i want to purchase them but i can only find them on miniaturesweets but you can only get 1 of them for 1 which seems a bit much for one gem does anyone know if taobao/aliexpress sells something similar in bulk for less
  i like caramel ribbons stuff too anon  ive bought a couple off aliexspress  this one is more plain no gold setting but i prefer that for my stuff        fwiw literally everything on miniaturesweet can be bought for cheaper except some molds i guess in greater quantities on aliexspress i do buy from them sometimes when i want guaranteed shipping and a bunch of stuff in one go though
  just saw someone i followed have a meltdown because she posted a charm sale 2hours ago and not all her pieces sold immediately some people really have such unrealistic expectations about how well their generic shit should sell   i followed her because she has some cute stuff but recently all shes been doing is whinging about people not paying her rent for her and creepy ddlg shit so its more for the entertainment factor now
im looking for a trim as close as possible to this one from moities long cross op in black does anyone know where i might find one im searching aliexpress ebay and taobao at the moment but i havent found the right thing yet
  i know who you are talking about give it atleast 24 hours before you start complaining makes a pole one hour later why didnt anyone vote
  just a little more detail its a fairly standard cluny lace with some metallic threads in it it looks a lot like pic related except in black im starting to consider buying this and dyeing it but would rather find something thats already in the right colours
does anybody have a pretty good reliable guide to getting started with resin crafts/jewelry
  maybe you could get some metallic thread and sew it onto the lace of your choice it would be time consuming and i dont know how it would turn out but it might be worth a shot
simple but cute ribbon tutorial      her stuff is super generic as well like yeah some resin artists do sell out in minutes or even seconds but thats because theyre doing something interesting/unique lol      youtube is your best friend  there are tons of basic resin videos ill have a dig and see if i can find any text/image ones though
  i found this  but it doesnt seem to let me add it to cart
does anyone know if you can glaze nonuv resin with uv resin
    yes i do this all the time i use epoxy  uv    i do epoxy mostly for molds and large items and then use uv for finishing items doming and to connect resin pieces together sort of like glue
  thank you that makes sense i was worried about making a totally dust free vacuum area if i had to glaze with epoxy lol
  oh you need a dust cover then daiso has these document holder things pic related but they carry a thicker one you can set up your stuff inside and when youre done close the top to keep dust and stuff out theyre great  i have like 5 or 6 now its also helpful because you can move them around easily and tuck them away so you can continue working in your work space while the resin cures
  nayrt but wow these look so useful thanks
does anyone know how to stop uv resin wrinkling/shrinking for some reason it keeps happening regardless of mold i cant work out of its too humid doubtful or im not curing long enough/too long or what
hi gulls im not sure if i will get an answer or not but i was curious how any of you make your bracelets ive seen a lot of people use the gold and pearl rosary chains which i really like however i wasnt sure if it was worth it to just buy the rosary chain and add charms to it or if i should just make my own chain if anyone does these what do you do
  i make them myself but for two reasons  1 you can customize the beads however you want  2 ive graduated from using random aliexpress metal to actual fine metals so this way you have control over what metals are used     its not that difficult and i kind of find beading relaxing
has anyone ever thought of making scented resin pieces i made some cute chocolate rings and i was wondering if adding some kind of chocolate fragrance oil would after the resin cures would do anything to it obviously it wouldnt be a permanent smell but i thought itd be a nice touch for customers who buy my stuff if no one knows much i may try it myself and come back with results
  dont do it i wouldnt buy anything scented no matter how cute it would be
  id only add it as an option not as a default
  sweetdollyhouse on etsys pieces are scented or at least some of them theyre not resin though they appear to be clay and they arent marketed to be scented but its pretty cute
  the resin wont cure properly you idiot
  she said adding it after the resin cures idiot
   so the oil would sit on top and rub off on my clothes no thanks sounds retarded
  maybe if there were a few clay accents glued to the resin and that could provide the scent
  that still sounds like the potential for disaster for something most people dont even want in the first place i dont want my jewelry smelling like nasty artificial strawberries i agree with 
  imo just scent your packaging or something if its not going to be permanent there are a lot of people who have sensitivities to that kind of thing
does anyone know of a quality whip decoden phone case maker that actually has customs open i have a galaxy note 8 but every shop i find that has a fitting case isnt really what im looking for and most people seem to be full up on customs
does someone know if i can find this glitter transparent adhesive in ali i found it on amazon but it doesnt ship to my country i just want to make cute stickers
  or if you are here and you make cases ill pay you upfront
no idea where to ask this but i got some jeans at a resell shop for a good price they fit me perfectly i love the cut and where the waist line falls but they have these stupid tacky rhinestones all over the ass i bought them regardless and im wondering if its possible for me to completly replace the back pockets with some corduroy or something i know next to nothing about working with denim but im willing to take them to someone and pay for it is this even doable    i hate when i have to pass up on a nice piece bc its has stupid superfluous bullshit on it and i want to start doing something about it
  you need to get a seam ripper and carefully remove the stitching holding the pocket to the jeans then remove the studs using this method     you can then use the old pockets to make a template for new pockets but your sewing machine may not cope with the thickness of the denim and corduroy together at the very least youll need a specific jeans/denim needle that wont break under all the layers
  thank you so much
  i make my own i use the vintaj onestep loop plier and its made my workflow a lot faster than just using regular pliers there are also other loop maker tools out there      can i ask where you get your fine metals do you purchase them online i got a few packs of eye pins in a trip to japan last year that are pretty nice but the ones i find at the store hobby lobby/michaels/joanns here in the us are brittle and break easily
  nart but i get fine metal wire from riograndecom im not sure if they sell eye pins tho ive never looked
is it still possible to make money off resin crafts if youre just starting now ive been interested in it for a while but it seems like it would be super oversaturated
  not if youre making generic letter hearts or gunk with glitter and stickers thrown in haphazardly you can still get by by doing something actually interesting imo
does anyone know an online shop that sells good/decent cotton lace in red
  help people like me dammit      im looking for a whip case with nicely made resin deco for a samsung galaxy note 8
  re the fine metals    im in canada so finding something is a pain in the ass i dont want to buy a ton from the usa and then get a ton of import fees    you can find some on etsy but check out the seller and make sure they are reputable ive heard rio grande is good ive heard the name firemountian but mixed reviews and halsteadbead    i havent looked much into them because theyre all usa based and again id rather a canadian based store     as for terms  gold plated is practically meaningless i wouldnt recommend unless the base metal was something nice like sterling silver  gold filled is good quality and more affordable than solid gold
what are yall grabbing off 1111 sales for craft stuff is it cool to post haul pics
           these three brands have all done custom cases in the past but youre going to have to contact them to see if theyre open
does anyone have suggestions for good tutorials on making shaker/snow globe charms especially if it shows the mold making itself i want to make some snow globe plug type earrings for my sister in law for christmas ive made molds and cast resin before but havent tackled shakers yet
  ive made necklaces using that method and while my work isnt very neat and it can be quite time consuming if you get good at making the chain you can make absolutely anything with it and you have complete freedom when you want to make something else please consider making your own chain
  id love to see a haul pic
  i dont know if they have something similar but theres a local store that orders from may arts ribbons us based i think you can order their ribbons online without having to bulk buy
  thanks but since when does moonbunny do phone cases
i guess this is the best thread for this with the holidays happening soon im trying to come up with a good gift i could make in a batch for a bunch of friends but all the diy gift liats are all easy mode i wanted to do something more like those really nice almost realistic gem soaps has anyone bere made a really great set of diy gifts before
no sewing thread so ill ask here anyone have a simple blouse pattern im looking for something that can be work with underbust jsks and that can suit classic most lolita blouse tutorials and patterns are for old school sweet
  another idea in the same bath category is the prize capsule bath bombs you can get very creative with the outside design and the scents and mold it around a small prize capsule with just about anything in it
     check the catalog anon
hey for the anon that was looking for caramelribbonesque heart gems       still kind of pricey for what it is but much better than miniaturesweets 1pc    i ordered some recently and they havent arrived yet but ive ordered from the same store before and they seem reliable
  omg you are a savior im ordering these right now
best place for buying resin and the needed supplies to start casting preferably not taobao
    what kind of resin  you can usually find epoxy resin at art or craft stores sometimes its called liquid gloss
  we dont have any craft stores here    is sophieandtoffee a good place to get things they seem to have everything i need to start working
  sophieandtoffee/miniaturesweet are just aliexspress/taobao resellers but if you dont mind paying the mark up its nice to get everything in one order
  how bad is the markup
  usually just like charging 1 for 1pc of something when you can get 20pc of that thing for 4
  yikes guess ill just get some of my molds thru them and get the resin/cabochons on aliexpress
looking for recommendations for custom decoden phone case stores preferably in europe
is the uv resin sold on ali ok to buy and if not where would be the best place to buy it i want to give it a shot but not sure where the best place to buy it is   also wondering about the lamp do you guys just use ones for nails
  pretty much all uv resin listings on ali sell the exact same uv resin and ive never had an issue with any of them im not sure if miniaturesweet uses the same one and just packages it differently but its the same level of quality in my experience but much cheaper    you can find smaller lamps than the big ones commonly used for nails just search for uv lamp torch on aliexpress mine is pretty small but it works great
  thanks anon ill order some from ali to try it out then
anyone else feel like an idiot doing craft sometimes i couldnt work out how all those insta resin accounts were getting the perfect iridescent effect  i knew they were using foils but my efforts had air bubbles galore or warped foil or had the backing resin leak in front of the foil i just realized i should be pressing the foil into wet resin and allowing it to self level to avoid all that
  sometimes the obvious is too obvious and your brain just skips it because it has to be harder than that
  thank you for the advice i just picked one up and its making my life a lot easier although i only picked up a 15 mm looper im going to have to order one that makes bigger loops
sooooo im actually really curious about what you guys think on this topic  i see a lot of people who have resin hauls where they buy premade cabochons like stars sea shells and all sorts of really common resin shapes then jewelry with it i was wondering if you guys prefer that method over making your own cabochons   i make pour all my own stuff and craft a lot by hand so i feel like its almost disingenuous that people just buy premade items hook them onto a bracelet and sell it for a decent markup on etsy i obviously dont look down upon it i just question it i suppose   opinions
  i mean thats what people do with beads its pretty unoriginal and kinda boring though not the sort of thing i would buy
  i thought some of them were using nail powders on partially filled moulds too ive not tried it out though but all those perfect insta accounts make me want to try
  ive done that too and it works best for darker nail powders ive yet to get an iridescent effect as colourful/shiny with powder alone
hey guys i am a student that wants to make electronics i was thinking of making some custom props or something like that related to electronics    have you gals needed any electronics in your outfits i would like to make some simple electronics leds touch sensors sound effect buttons as an order any ideas
  your customers honestly dont give a shit whether you bought premade cabochons or if you painstakingly hand poured every piece they just want an end product that looks good
tutorials for making bows and stuff that dont look too christmassy
i will never recover from the endless cycle of shitty phone videos but i did an animal crossing thing
  anon how did you make these like what is the base made of really inspiring i would definitely buy something like this
  oh nice i remember seeing your little clown buddy
  thanks basically its a resin coated sandwich of sealed films and some painstakingly labourous glitter placement if you want one or to commission one tho my instagram and etsy is dreamcathedral      though i recycled some of the bits from my clown buddy this one was definitely a lot more work
where can i get shaker film i can only find it on sophie and toffee and theyre sold out
  its just mylar look up mylar sheet or something
  theres some flower scented resins out there if that is something youd like i dont know how strong the smell is tho
i wont do this now what with everyone busy for the holidays but would anyone be interested in monthly challenges where we come up with a theme and try to create pieces based on it we could keep the thread alive with little progress pics and talking about our techniques and inspirations for that specific piece    i dont know about prizes or anything but maybe the person with the most votes gets to pick the next months theme     seems like a fun idea to start a new year off with we could do it in january
  i would be interested in this it would be nice to have something to get critique on that isnt necessarily linked to a personal account as well
  sounds fun as long as the theme is broad enough to include people who do plushies along with all the other crafts like resin and clay id be down  i kinda quit cosplaying so i have a ton of fabric and nothing to do with it
  why not begin with christmas theme i bet everyone has something christmasy they have done earlier if theyre too busy to make new ones
  id prefer a winter theme over a pure christmas one i find most holiday themed stuff really tacky
    yeah i was definitely thinking of making it cross medium for sure because i know folks here are into other hobbies besides resin      i sort of want to do something that might be broad enough for everyone to get their creative engines going but not so that i might accidentally pick a theme that someone might already have premade things on hand maybe using a random generator to come up with 2 ideas to mix together like birbs  candies etc    plus i personally get burnt out on christmas real fast
because im an autist with zero creativity ive taken to making animal noses out of cheap paper clay and milliput  pls only gentle bulli
  i kinda dig it you should get a nice soft salmon colour for them and dark brown to do little spots and splotches on some you gonna attempt whiskers
  i have access to a tonne of miniatures paints so i can do splotches and spots honestly the grey ones were the colour scheme test for my tyranid kill team hence the neon pink  the first lot wont have whiskers but ill experiment with painting them on / a bodied resin /wire in later lots
  tyranids  oh shit my dude i just got an eldar harlequin shadowseer that i wanted to use some fancy nail glitter on
ia hear with some more resin doming tips because doming is the fucking worst  cover the other side of your peace with masking/painters tape before you dome to save yourself fucking forever in sanding
  what i do is keep an eye on them within an hour or so after pouring and keep them on a big wax paper sheet if any leaks over the edges i just slide the piece away from the spilled bit and the domed leftovers usually corrects itself
  thank you for your service
anons do you have any tutorials you can recommend for making rosettes/brooches am thinking of making one to match a specific coord i realise thats pretty basic but i havent done much crafting so any advice on what backing/adhesives to use would be really useful
where is the best place to buy bulk uv and epoxy resins i tried taobao but its a forbidden item
  aliexpress for epoxy and cheap uv    if you want padico amazon jp etsy or the padico webshop
  how is banggood i have another canadian friend that orders thru them being a leaf is hard
  i think your understanding of sculpting is good but i just kind of find the idea weird personal opinion     i could see furries liking them though or pet owners if you did commissions to make them look like the pets snoot
  or pet owners if you did commissions to make them look like the pets snoot  at the moment im donating the ones i make to something affiliated with a pets rescue group but the furry angle wasnt something i had actually considered
stupid question but is the silicone whip on decoden cases soft like is it squishy how easily do they pick up dust
  a method that works for me is sewing so that theres two layers of fabric similar to a pillowcase so that any fraying is invisible
i miss the plush pattern sharing these threads used to do
  tried this one out and messed with it a bit  if anyone else wants to share patterns that would be cool
i know a lot of you guys wanted the kera manga translated unfortunately ch 1 and 2 seem to be missing so the group that formed to translate it is mostly holding off until the physical release of the manga drops    in the meantime we translated the 4 prototype chapters for you gulls
each chapter is 4 pages this is chapter 2  all originals can be found here by the way  1   2   3   4 
fun edit
chapter 3
  chapter 4
  and thats all for now hopefully we can get some quick scans of the actual release soon after it drops
cute
i love the coffeeshop boss hes hillarious   thank you so much for this
thank you all
thank you so much anons may manasama bring you many blessings and all the burando your closet can hold  is there plans to put this up anywhere else id like to bookmark a page for posterity but this thread will inevitably die
these are so cool thank you so much quick question though this is not the same as that other manga with a kinda similar looking main character who is also a lolita right
how cool whats the name of this series
just to consolidate recent translation things heres a link to chapter 13 of the full length manga a different anon translated  
this is seriously great thanks anon i feel like this comes up all the time the courage it takes to wear loud fashion
  from what i understand its the same manga but these chapters were like the pilot for it
  literally lold
thanks so much anon eagerly looking forward to whats to follow translators are a blessing
one of the translator anons here      its called kitai fuku ga aru which means something like the clothes i want to wear   these 4 short chapters are pilot chapters the author put on twitter before he got published his account is taketoratsuneki  the characters are mostly the same as in the published manga but the published one fleshes things out a lot and builds up more slowly it takes a while for the main character to get enough confidence to wear lolita to work for example   i forgot to save the first couple chapters so were waiting for a physical release to scan should come out in january i think     thanks for the kind words anons well continue translating fun /cgl/related stuff
  i chuckled anon thanks for this edit i love it
  kekeke  i hope youll continue translating soon thank you for your work anon chan
    youre welcome yeah currently were just a small group of 3 and kinda just doing it for fun on our free time       yeah glad to see theres enough interest in this that someone else is looking to translate as well      definitely especially parents i thought it was nice how they made it a point to bring up the moms negative reaction to wearing frills right at the start of ch2      credit for it goes to our typesetter lol
thank you for your hard work and sharing these scans i hope more people will start to fall in love with this manga
i hope this comic will someday be available in english print   i like to collect lolita media for my shelf
previous thread 
  many thanks to the other dump anons for making the previous thread btw

  i dont mind daily lolita but the sweater boots and tights of this are so ugly       photo angle is so yokes      its a fashion not a costume take those dead animals off your head      dress doesnt fit yellow bloomers and shoes are too fancy for this      adorable minus the ruined face      everything about this is absolutely hideous other than the honey cake jsk the socks may match but they dont match in this clownlike coord      cute as always odd choice of coat for casual though
  shes so beautiful but this is the worst shes ever looked she looks ginormous
  you sound insufferable
  since theres so much brown in the coord already id love to see this with a book house colours bluexbronze scarf      why would you wear such an ott coord and wig with random plain tights and ballet flats
dumping a couple forgotten coords i dont think got posted to the last thread
  ah many thanks anon i didnt think to check other than going from last posted
  the kitten is a and the girl reminds me of chilling adv sabrina
  you sound like a newfag trying to pass as a super rude seagull because omg were all salty bitches here kek
  what dress is this
  admitting to buying a replica  the absolute state of fauxlitas
  damn she looks like a better version of pt
  the way you talk makes it sound like you think you know how to dress better than anyone you bitched about but youre probably sitting behind your screen in a bodyline dress seething because the only brand you own is a purse
  this is so cute i love everything about this
  this is a the smarmiest post ive ever seen
  i really liked this until i clocked the harry potter theme
  oof those bangs
  what a mess
  i love the art on this skirt by itself but it doesnt look right on a garment she coordinated it super sloppy too
  i love this however im wondering about the hair is it hers or a wig does anybody know wh where i can get a ringlet wig in brown or black
        salty you got called out dress better i would post compliments if there was anything posted that was really cute but we need fewer cat eared itas like  and more nice well thought out coords like 
  nope i have a closet full of brand that matches stay mad though
  guess what just because youre being disagreed with doesnt mean the people in the photos are talking to you im only one of the people you responded to and ive never posted to cof  your theory doesnt hold up and severely anons dont care for your forced opinions
  what dress is this
  breakfast toast by spinchen
stop taking bait
  its not bait to point out that an upskirt shot is not what you should be using for cof posts that a wig looks costumey and awful or other minor concrit
  we need fewer cat eared itas  who was posted wearing cat ears you seem like youre still butthurt about the cheap cat ear argument from a few threads ago
ohh honeyshe really needs to get some bangs and maybe put her hair up in two braids or low ponytails at least that tangled mess looks like the hairstyle i use when i do housework yeez  also that jsk  bolero combo is just completely unflattering she needs better fitting clothes and at least some lacy thigh highs instead of utk cause those really emphasise her muscular calves
  miss point demon cats
  the hair is shit but i think the bolero combo looks fine maybe pink shoes instead of black to make it look balanced
  the bolero hides her waist and makes her look like a fridge though
  i love that fucking pose
  implying that this cut has an actual waist anyway  i mean i agree i think it would be better suited with a nice old school blouse but its not the worst eyesore ive ever seen on cof for certain
  and ponies can fly i get it but please keep trying to show yr not an insufferable ita
when you dress your normie friend in lolita
  your caption is so accurate it hurts shes very cute though
  well thats unfortunate
  shes cute but she needs some more accessories maybe a necklace or choker and maybe a black bag or something if she was going out and had use for one i dont mind the messy hair the whole outfit is a bit oldschoolish anyway but it just feels a bit incomplete lace topped socks would also help this out
  fucking hate eyebrows done like that looks super cringey with lolita
  this looks kind of oldschool styled so i like the messy hair and the dark shoes with a light coordinatethe fit is really unfortunate though i get frump is accepted in oldschool but this is too much some lace topped socks would be cute too
  looking like garbage  old school  no
  that anon said kinda oldschool styled not old school learn to read before you sperg out
  thanks senpai
  thank you
      why is this so frowned upon why are gulls so obsessed with not being like the normies or worried about normies invading the fashion
  cause it looks like shit
  yeah but thats just your opinion she looks fine to me
  i was the eyebrow comment and it had nothing to do with how supposedly normie you find it i just think it looks like shit in lolita its not even normie its instaho makeup
  lolita is an alternative fashion subculture the opposite of normie by default normies joining the fashion consistently look like garbage and lower the overall quality of interactions in the community see the shit that constantly comes out of fb groups as an example
  clashing aesthetics at least with whats in trend at the moment western trend is to have a bold glamorous look lolita tends towards soft and luxurious if that makes sense if you took normie fashion in the 50s and mixed with lolita less people would be against it
      t cakefaces or barefaced uggos who dont know how to blend
  are you retarded or do you just want a you
  thot brows dont work with lolita silly
  t caterpillar brows
  im pretty sure most gulls are bare faced average bitches who think bb cream is enough
saturday dump time
  skipped the two that were already posted
  dump complete
  the raggedy wig and headdress are unfortunate hopefully she stays in the fashion and buys nicer stuff
  holy fuck that dress does not fit
  this is actually a super adorable idea but i would personally wear it with peeking bloomers with a pair of either bread patterned tights or a pair of plain lace top socks and a pair of red ballet wrap rhs    i think the tights are goofy and i love them but they make her skin look diseased an issue im sure is common for anyone with them       anyone have sauce on the shoes i dont really go on facebook often       this looks so comfy
  when you buy a sack dress to let your saggy titties hang free but still cant raise your arms without risking damage to the dress  unfortunate
  huge septum ring  tiny dress    bullinababydressshopkei
  i had to go find a picture of how the dress was meant to be worn to cleanse my eyes
  doesnt look like theyre hanging free just too big
  is this a man
  i love the nostalgic era of ap sweet clones and this print was popular back then combined with the cerise bow and fluffy accessories it is a perfect update of the super sweet ap clone era
  not knowing agnes  your newfag is showing
  why does she give me of so much chris chan vibes      im usually put off by lady sloth dresses but this coord look cute      whats the point of posting a pic washed out to the point where the coord is barely visible anymore
    the point is to hide how garbage quality the dress is of course
  yikes i really dont like this the cheap hair accessories and gloves kill it and the overall sweet look for a very refined dress doesnt help
  lol the amount of shoop and filter on this
  lol shit i thought it was taobao from  she looks like an overstuffed pillowcase thank you for the eye cleanser
  nayrt but ive known who agnes is for years and i still ask myself that question nearly every time she posts
  i dont feel like the shoes fit with it also the dress looks too classic to be coorded as a sweet piece       its rare to see brown x blue coords but i kinda like this one id change the wig colour though      this is cute and casual the right version looks better imho      i dont like this kind of makeup but maybe thats her way of expressing inside the fashion still it looks too katy perrish for me      nice as always i dont dig the white headpiece though the jacket on the other hand is a dream
  her posture makes my neck hurt why do so many lolitas have such shit posture
  that garish print  tacky ribbon  chiffon ruffle instead of lace    and the obvious  animal ears    yuck
  the shoes are killing this  it would have been cute but yuck
  a lot of baby has that tacky ribbon and i love it 
  jesus christ that dress doesnt look good on her and her hair is so unsuitable those shoes also dont match at all and those socks barely fit im sorry girl i hope you improve but sell those shoes and dress and start over     girl you dont need this much filter or shoop im sure you look fine without it     looks cute and cozy but the poses arent too great and i feel like she should look up more at the camera     as always i love her
  nothing par the matching headbow is the same color in this coordinate and it bothers me
    the utter lack of cohesion with her colors makes me rage but its a cute passable coord she should ditch that star clip though it looks out of place
  girl you dont need this much filter or shoop im sure you look fine without it  this is such a weird common misconception on cgl some people just really like photo editing i seriously dont think photo editing has anything to do with self esteem in regards to physical appearance
  those are some extremely unfortunate proportions frump works when you dont look like a fridge      honestly it isnt about looking normie this girl just looks like a basic bitch lets go down the list shall we   uneven visible roots   fried thinning bleach blonde hair   uneccesary fullcoverage foundation at least 10 more yellowtoned than her actual skin tone    i just stamped these brows ontier clown makeup   streaky contouring   d u c k f a c e  the coordinate itself looks fine she just looks more at home with ugg boots yoga pants and a starbucks pumpkin spice latte its possible to look both like a normal human being and a lolita looking like you belong in 2012 isnt it
  frump usually works in old school newfag
  newfag  that buzzword doesnt even make sense in this context if youre built like a linebacker frump doesnt work on you oldschool or not
  anon she looks bad
  i was around during that time and shitty hair was still unacceptable frump or not  you need to be able to put aside your butthurt and see that not everyone looked like a hot mess during that time  pic relatedacceptable old school frump her hair is still nicely done and the fit doesnt make her look like a pillowcase
sunday dump time man too many coords on weekends
  this is a mess
  anon shes not wearing the right cut of dress and those shoes arent the right color i wear old school i know about old school old school itas exist shes got potential but she needs to find the right shape of dress for her body and to do that she might have to alter some pieces which is fine because most of those pieces are damaged as fuck already and she needs to get herself a pair of black mary janes if for some reason this commenter is her or she will see this i want to throw out some advice i understand wanting rhs for this coord but that color and those styles of straps look really really bad with this specific coord she should wear a blouse under the jsk pull the top portion down a bit then layer the bolero and have a pair of plain black mary janes or a pair of pink rhs and around the ankle would be a better position for the straps she should also curl then tease her pigtails if she wants that perfect old school frump that would be the most basic way to make this a nice old school coord
  dump complete
  lets go down the list shall we  god you sound so fucking stuck up  how many sticks are just crammed up your fucking asshole lady
  ew
  nothing wrong with the shoes if you actually knew about old school like you say you do youd know a lot of the times they wore what they had which could mean black shoes with a pastel pink coord
  define shitty there was a time in early lolita when fried bleached hair with roots was seen in snaps sometimes dyed loud red sometimes left piss yellow    using snaps to define what works with oldschool is lame change my mind fried hair was edgy and intentionally bad then and isnt any better now even your pic looks damaged from dye and teasing
  that isnt duck face and her foundation matches her neck jelly shes pretty and you arent
  editing sure but photoshop is a sign that someone is insecure to me
  toddler telekinesischan really needs to gtfo
                            oh goodness hi this is me my fb friend just informed me i had a lot of feedback on /cgl for this coord and i got scared but its not bad at all i appreciate it i would also rather people not defend me though as i do not post here or read the boards the cut of the dress is indeed underbust style so a poster was right theres no defined waist at the natural waistline that doesnt change that mine isnt a good coordinate i understand now that it makes me look blocky with this bolero  sorry for the novel and thanks again for the concrit everyone   lolita linebacker out
      the coat matches the shoes at least looks like she made an effort matching with the scarf to the bag then the cutsew with the legwear most of these could even be the exact matching shades but the lighting throws them off and the whites match as well going by the sleeve cuffs overlapping the fur cuffs    idk i think its a fascinating case of doing it right by the rules and yet not really quite hitting it i think the lavender/purple clashes just a bit too much with the blue and pink together and thats what throws it off probably would work better if it was just with blue or with the lavender/purple
  utter lack of turn out  a personal pet peeve of mine is when people who have obviously never taken ballet attempt a ballet pose
  hime cut and bangs  not kawaii on everyone obviously      her nose contour makes me laugh every time
  oh pray tell what editing programs are cglapproved if photoshop isnt
  this is genuinely ita
  snow purikura apps if use ps youre just an insecure liar  sarcasm
  friends dont tell friends when this stuff happens reexamine that friendship anon
  i dunno if i was close with the friend then i would and i wouldnt mind people telling me either as long as this stuff isnt straight up insults i dont see the harm in letting the person know theyre being talked about
  moving some of the red down or some of the black up would make her look less severely colorblocked
  glad youre not trying to defend yourself and realize your mistakes unlike a lot of people do im sure youll look better next time maybe even look at other people with the same dress like  and others you can find online
  you must be trolling even op has better sense but hey enjoy looking like a mess well just laugh at you when you post your old school coords on cof
  what dress is this
    she didnt say       interestingly her post says that she started learning ballet when she was 4       its from dear margaret
  why is it so hard for people to understand you need a petti and need to put effort into your hairmakeup
  can someone id the skirt please
  wat my point is that using messy damaged hair was okay in oldschool and shouldnt be considered okay now we should do better than they did you sound like a brainless copier of other peoples coords
  there is damaged and then theres just im lazy so i left my hair in an ugly undone half bun   but hey i know its hard to comprehend this when you have no taste enjoy being a unique snowflake ita
  needs a different blouse because of the neckline hiding under jsk it looks like a normie shirt from afar
  poof is crucial it would have made this look more lolita and also integrated that underskirt
    you sound mad   she matches her neck but not her body shes also definitely pursing her lips in duckface fashion and that lip gloss looks sticky  sorry i like to look at people and not processed garbage    that white bonnet needs to go    this is breathtaking
  beautiful    cute as heck i like how the kc works with the otks and the bows in the op print i like this otomestyle color balancing
  are you retarded im not defending that girls bad hair
  would have preferred a black bonnet instead and maybe meta lace otks otherwise this looks good to me sauce on those wedge shoes
  her makeup is bringing this down a bit if she did a less bold coverage for lip and more blush i would love it the coord itself is really adorable but make and glasses dont really fit the style the make more the glasses could pass fine if the makeup was more cutesy and matched the coord colors
  holy shit she looks so effing good here    she should stick to casual like this its still a bit messy with questionable choices but at least the no bangs and no makeup look works with cas
  wheres the anon that hates this girls smile im surprised they havent come out of the woodwork yet
  i am one of the anons that doesnt hate her smile per se just the way her makeup makes it look like she has no mouth at all i just scrolled past her post and sighed   noface lolita
  i think it looks fine honestly i think thats super nitpicky
  goes on and on about how fried hair was in old school blah blah   nuu fried hair bad thats not what i meant  the girl in the snap has teased hair not damaged hair and the main point was about the fit of the outfit and overall look   but expecting an ita to understand that is a little too much it seems
  i know she lurks cgl it doesnt bother me all concrit is good concrit just because its not gentle doesnt mean its not true     im kind of new so ill take any concrit i can get as long as its honest   she said they were miho matsuda i believe
  i dont hate her smile but i have commented on it before i think the nolips look looks sad on her and she could benefit from some contrasting colors her skin/hair/makeup all being so close to each other makes her look like a washed out toe just a bit of lip color and maybe a change of smile and shed be so cute     i dont feel the need to say it every time but since you asked
  sorry i like to look at people and not processed garbage  and yet here you are on anon and not showing your face youre probably average as fuck
  t processed garbage enjoy your premature aging
  miho matsuda  damn i already know its not avail in my size  thx tho
  someone plz give me the sauce on this dress omfg i love it
  oh i see you only know how to respond with memes
  it looks like a normal smile to me how is one supposed to smile
  
  nayrt and im not one of the smile haters i think it looks like shes trying to emulate the misako smile but it looks weird because she has very thin lips      still nayrt but  looks bad while  is a good example of somewhat heavy makeup that suits lolita
  its as if shes folding her lips onto themselves and stretching her mouth wide that combined with a nude color lip make it look like she has no lips at all which is a bit unflattering on everyone
  oh god    i didnt realize it came in wine i just got excited because i saw the candy canes and thought it was a taobao print dammit
  premature aging is a meme now  just because you dont want to believe doesnt mean its a meme
  god this girl is hideous
  way harsh tai  i could see her actually being quite pretty if she trimmed her bangs to be level with her eyebrows used a lighter lipstick and just practiced her smile a little  maybe fluffing up her hair a little and removing her glasses for photos too i know this seems like a laundry list of improvements but honestly she has potential hideous is for lost causes
  very cute i love the red and bits of yellow
  its not even the makeup that ruins this for me its the hair and those weird tattoolooking eyebrows that fade in give her a wig and some softer more gentle looking normal brows and shed look fine
  keep moving the goalposts dummy fried hair is bad and bad hair is bad ive never contradicted this good hair is styled nicely straightened curled or braided
  but  isnt even wearing lipstick stupid
  im confused as fuck because i have that dress in lav and it doesnt have candy cane what is going on
  this girl has supposedly been in lolita for over a decade i think she is a lost cause
  but there is in the stock pictures
  sounds like you got a replica
  it sounds like you know her and have a vendetta
  omg really
  anon is right im afraid this is as good as it gets
  nope not at all i just repeat what i hear through the grapevines
  sheee always looks so terrible
  your writing skills are bad and you should feel bad then why the hell did you even reply to me in the first place if you agreed that she looked bad idgit
  ssssssssssnake
  the lav has black and white candy canes
  why would anyone do this to love love valentine
  why do so many lolitas have such shit posture    shitposting on their laptops all day while not even getting up from bed
  replica  youre as retarded as the other anon all of the taobao replica makers havent and especially not oo jia even gotten ahold of one of these jsks yet to make a replica
  your writing skills are bad  its not my fault your reading comprehension is garbage tier someone offering crit on crit does not mean they liked the original post it means that they disagree or want to agree but add to your post
  snaps are too mainstream change my mind   cant make a salient point in a separate post but insists on adding inane long edgelord opinions on someone elses post   10/10 confirmed austist  its not my fault that your rambling is incomprehensible   anyways this thread is being derailed by your petty rantings imma dump to get it moving cause im not a leech
  what is even going on with that hat
  this is really nice i feel like i have a knee jerk reaction to disliking sweaters with this knit because they look out of place in coords so often but the silhouette of the cardigan is really nice and it works perfectly with the mori feel i usually dislike utks as well but im sold on them now
  this coord is adorable love the cute red and yellow accents
  adorable coord i love the way things go together
  everything about this is impeccable im in love with the amount of lace it makes everything look super elegant
  oh cute
  i saw the thumbnail and was excited thinking ptposting was back
  i think this kind of sweet or soft gothic suits this girl very well serious allgothic allmoitie looks are too harsh on her
  this would be really cool on someone thinner who didnt look like a middle age tumblr twat
  are you okay anon photoshop is editing
  this is such a pretty coord on her and i hope she wears things like this more often never noticed what a cute face she has before too      i want to like this but it desperately needs something in her hair at least some flowers or something       i dont like either of these outfits but they look so damn happy that i cant hate the picture you do you cute happy itas      everything this girl wears is godly i want to be as skilled as her someday      are those piercings all over her nose or did she try to do some sort of lion makeup       shes beautiful and this has potential but its just a little bit wrong in every way the skirt needs to be a little longer or have some things more like lace or a ruffle at the edge a jsk would be better too to cover up the weird fit of the blouse the shoes dont really match and theyre are a million brown tones here the headdress doesnt go with the hairstyle it would look better with loose curled or wavy hair i want to see her redo a coord like this in a couple of years i bet she will improve i hope she stays in the fashion though she really is very cute       why such an intense mask she cant be wearing that for aesthetic reasons      i mostly like this but its visually trippy and those normie long sleeves arent a good look
  why so zoomed out and did anyone wear anything nice to that event all the pics on cof so far are so underwhelming       the headbow looks like cat ears maybe thats the point though      why would you do your hair like that for a coord like this       not the most flattering top on her i feel like she knows that too       why would she post this to cof its a cute dailyalamode outfit but surely she knows its not very lolita and people will hate it      dont take the coat off that blouse isnt flattering at all      this cut is not flattering on her bad photo too i feel like shes about to stomp on me but not in a badass way       the dress doesnt seem to fit her very well but she has a very beautiful face id prefer this with white shoes and bag       why is this thread so full of people with mediocre coords turned ugly by lack of hair accessories all this needs is a floral clip to be boringly ok and where is her petti burn the coat too      red lipstick good no lipstick bad this is a great example of how makeup can make someone look so different and more put together      cute girl but what is that jacket did she not have a white one why didnt she take it off for the pic the style doesnt go with the dress at all       unflattering dress horrible shoes old school isnt for everyone      i wish i could see this with her standing up but the coord seems nice enough       i like the coord even if it doesnt really suit her good effort      i feel like i should hate this but i just dislike it that dress doesnt look as bad as i expected doesnt feel lolita to me though      she looks nice here though i think her arms are too bare she needs a bunch of pearl bracelets or something      socks are wrinkly and falling down the pigtails need to be higher too they look both heavy and too thin here
  this is so cute      i admire briz but those shoes and wristcuffs dont match at all maybe i just dont unterstand ott but im not keen here      this is impressive but i find it ugly what is the idea behind this what is she trying to achieve       love that dress not a bad coord either she looks cute big girls with boob this is how to do it      this is so adorable id prefer with white shoes or white shoe clips on the shoes but its still nice
    
  make me
  that wig is so thin and sad a shorter fuller one would look a lot less fake
  taobao
  its not that  doesnt wear lipstick its just that she wears nude nude is a color that is perfectly acceptable for sweet lolita yall act like she goes bare faced
  oops meant 
  newfriend relegate yourself to a few replies per post you are ruining everyones view with your endless reply
  no i just didnt notice them in the print until i saw the photo here and then i looked at my dress little closer they stand out more on the red colorway they are on the lav  and i bought from ap jp using an ss
  i just repeat what other people say   holy shit so youre just brain dead then
  pirate fairy yea we got a winner here
  wait did this really come in that color or is it a replica
  wow i didnt realize this before
  i think it might have been from an mto i think there was one for jewel marine im not 100 sure
  now that i read the comments she actually said this was a made to order its dream marine btw
      youre probably one of those people who talks so much that others cant get a word in too work on your social skills you autist
  i usually do but if everyone is going to see them anyway what is the point also it fills the thread less quickly      im very quiet in real life i just wanted everyone to have at least one comment on their outfit because no one ever commented on mine when i posted in cof and that makes me sad
  im very quiet in real life  ntayrt but boy oh boy does that make sense i see you come here to let off steam since youre too much of a fucking pussy in real life
  disagree nude is awful for sweet subtle pink or even just sheer lipgloss is cute
what the actual hell is this
  absolute normcore garbage if thats the answer you were looking for
  why are the mods letting this slide this is absolute trash dont bother posting if youre not gonna iron your skirt and make your outfit proper yeesh  almost said something but i know shell be one of those snowflakes that cry about how its still totally lolita
  short on energy but not so much that she couldnt throw on cat ears or pom poms and a choker    gross it takes literally zero effort to wear fewer or better accessories
      if you cover the top half of  and imagine shes wearing a cute actually lolita cutsew that would be a cute outfit actually so i can see a reason for it being a borderline case    im actually kinda amazed how trash it looks just because she used something so baggy shapeless too long and clashing aesthetic for the top half
  no it wouldnt are you retarded and blind
  wrinkly ugly skirt  black tights for no reason  beat up shoes    thats cute how
    i think you just havent been in lolita to remember the days of cutsews with tiered ruffle skirts     for my part i dont have many photos of that style saved so heres something more modern instead        fair enough skirt needs an iron   lavender x black coord see holy lantern lavender for example  fair enough i havent seen the post and dont know that her shoes are actually beat up and dirty    ita thread is here  if you wanna bash on her more
    no it wouldnt terrible concept
      i seriously hope that the ugly huge floral headpieces go away soon because this is getting ridiculous
  do you have fucking eyes cute cutsew or not it would still look like shit    also  not knowing how greentexting works  are you her
  ive been wearing lolita for 13 years but okay that tiered skirt looks like shit and there is no redeeming qualities here
      wow youre both really invested in having an argument huh    all right heres your wrinkly cotton ap skirt     fine by me if you want to insist on whatever anyway the differences will show when youre dressing yourselves for my part id rather not derail the thread so ill let the difference in opinions be
  if your point is that its okay because burando did it thats a pretty shit argument the ap looks bad and the one posted upthread looks slightly similar except even worse even the mam denim ones are pretty bad imo i dont think this style is appropriate for lolita since it ruins the silhouette
  you know you can literally iron shit right no need to have a wrinkly skirt either way there is way more wrong with that outfit than just the top and no cutsew is going to help you out
  i dont think shes a lost cause her coordinates from what i have seen are usually fine she just needs to learn how to pose honestly her poor photos are what really bring the coords down imo       do you know what a vendetta is
  in the left picture i thought she had a big hime bump wig with a white headband in it the reality is so much worse
  yep or steam
  the girl in  is wearing the mask because theres a bunch of wildfires in california rn making the air quality unsafe
  yes what i said was true but you are correct as well
  oh i didnt know she was from there i saw the fire on the news that is very sad 
  she was such a cutie at the event i dont care her coord looked really nice and suited her very well love the fancy babushka idea
  well no one cares about your cowardly little comments people like you are the reason its stupid to take concrit from these threads
  ok ntayrt and im not even trying to defend that girls outfit but the whole ap is bad and other various brand hate on this board really makes me question that people actually enjoy lolita here
  what  posts is just criticism their too much of a pussy to comment to any on any of these girls posts on cof a good number of these girls have concrit welcome in their posts too but you wont see coward anon there
  can you read i said that particular skirt is bad my point is that not everything made by a brand should be worn as lolita
  the boobs tho
  this poor girl  no eyebrows   huge forehead   weird eyes     only god aka a surgeon can fix this now or bangs someone tell this girl to get bangs
  you should focus more on her coord than her face you need your eyes fixed
  is it just me or this girl has a very weirdface
  its kind of hard to when her face is literally zoomed in on the second image sorry you got posted ugly
  pretty positive that first one is a hat lol
is there a new thread
  no
  youre not the only person with this isss though is what im saying go ahead keep being defensive
  issue god damn
  should i make a facebook account and start one are there any rules about starting cof thread
  why dont you just post in this one this thread hasnt reached bump limit
  for all that brand youd think she could afford some brow makeup
  she does but i kinda like it
  this girl always makes lolita look like a costume those who argue that its just ott havent seen good ott
  lets see what good ott is according to you
  a lot of the coords from the ap paris tea party earlier this year were very good some of them had angel wings as well this girls coord looks like a hot mess
  i think thats the angle dude
  the fuck
  way to be vague and not give an actual example
  shes absolutely adorable printed tights would look great with this but i can see shes tying the white of her blouse in with the tights white legwear with gold accents would look nice
this was such a lovely coord at the first glance but  jsk  ap replica of whimsical vanilla  she even said that she knew it was replica when she bought it and that she cant fit or afford brand first of all she looks very much able to fit ap and if you cant afford something maybe fucking work for it instead of stealing someones art this is some ita shit despite of how the coord looks like stop encouraging behavior like this with your 150 likes
  oh the thread is saging im a doofus
  she
last thread     the summer paris meet was small but very successful now its time for the winter chicago meet  are you planning to attend    the commwide parapara project was also a success the next one is currently being planned      officekiko x esperanza boots started an old school gal nostalgia revival followed by an event in shibuya 109 now ok is doing a denim collaboration that is also inspired by gal/90s fashion  did you buy the boots yet are you interested in the new denim     it also seems as though gyaru is having a small revival in the western community are you excited or annoyed with all of the newbies    any winter meets planned locally if so are you/your circle/comm doing anything special for the holidays    georgie is starting a handmade accessory brand do you think youll buy any items    any winter trends youre excited to try or bring back
  im going to the chicago meet if anyone has an idea where i can get cute boots thatll hold up on snow/ice thatd be great    im excited by the boom because it seems to be more girls vaguely aware what gyaru is and not just himekaji/liz lisa types who actually wear larme and got lost    i am so excited for georgies brand old school doesnt suit me so i doubt ill be getting anything but i cant wait to see it all and see everyone wearing it
  i wish i could attend but america is way out of my budget i hope my local comm starts doing more meets again this winter    same for the esperanza boots too expensive and they dont even have my size    i hope we get a lot of new gyaru but the type that actually want to improve    i love that georgie is launching her own thing although the hat isnt really my style i will definitely keep my eyes open for stuff i might like    as for winter trends i love how normal shops are starting to sell more gold camo animal prints and fur items they are totally up my alley
  oh man im not a gyaru but i want to meet them because nostalgia and i rarely hear anything from the areas circle im so gyaru isnt dead     maybe start with nordstrom there are some cute duckboots by sperrys on sale search boots color pink rn also there are some cute hot pink quilted combat boots by dailyshoes on amazon they come in other colors
  im so glad gyarus not dead     i think these would be cute and comfy with furry legwarmers
also id like to talk about my favourite holiday before its completely gone  who had your favourite halloween look i think netta looked stunning but kelsey had some great looks too in the run up to the actual day
  netta was absolutely my favorite look of this years halloween i had so many looks planned this year but depression got in the way but there is always next year      for chicago winters i think a pair of mini bailey bow boots from ugg are indispensable pic related i wear mine throughout the winter i just make sure to avoid the slush/salt on the ground since itll ruin the suede they come in a lot of cute colors and are super versatile when it comes to pairing them with a gyaru look kind of an investment but definitely have been my saving grace
  oh yeah seconding its hard to avoid the salt/slush here but id at least put on some suede/nubeck protection spray and have a cleaning brush on the side
  some of these look very similar to esperanza boots
  i have a love  hate relationship with the western gyaru boom i love that more people are interested in gyaru the only thing i hate is finding cheap clothes are becoming extinct i saw a cute jumpsuit on a japanese site and only being 3 minutes up its sold out
whats w the western comm being obsessed with lower lashes lets face it a lot of japanese gal dont wear massive ones and they dont seem to exist in old school so why is it a requirement
  im going depending on how much people are going im a liz lisa fag though
where to buy old issues of egg
  i think its because most of us have been in the style longer so we are used to a certain look that can only be achieved with lower lashes  on lazy days ill use just a good mascara but i dont feel as though my eyes are up to par on those days so ill never post the look      i kind of get why you might say that but unless you can see the number ticket sales i dont know how you would know how many people are going either go or dont kind of flakey imo i am going and im really excited about it   ive talked to reina about it a bit and she seems to be putting a lot of effort into this so i cant wait to see how it all turns out      japanese mercari and fril are you best options
  im going to gal meet in chicago itll be my very first meet so im happy plus im doing a para para performance too so im also excited about that    the ok boots are way too expensive and like anon saidno shoe size     i like old school so i cant wait to see what georgie got        anon i too hate lowerlashes i take inspiration from certain gals that dont wear lower lashes and just kind replace that with like thicker eyeliner at the bottom
  well you can see how much people bought the tickets because it was limited to 100 so far only 9 people have purchased the general admission 
  for me on a lot of western faces especially my own lower lashes depending on placement and style make the difference between gyaru and just cute dolly make up or instahoe make up theres such a fine line obviously you can do both those styles with lower lashes and do gyaru without lower lashes but it does help with a certain eye shape and look and some people are going to really struggle to look gyaru without them if someones giving concrit to wear lower lashes that person probably needs them
  the event on fb says 21 people are going some of them might buy their tickets later on
  ebay sometimes carry them and your best bet will be to search on secondhand sites like gyaru sales mercari and fril the last two you need a shopping service
i love old inyourface mars dia and datura hoping some western revival will bring these trends back somehow      mercari fril and ya are probably your best bet
  yeah i hope so too
in your opinion what are the 2 most important aspects of gyaru im curious to see everyone opinions obviously theres a lot that goes into a look but if you had to choose just two what would you say most define gyaru to you
  a genuine love for the style and culture is number one not just trying to fit in for the sake of it but the strong desire to improve your look and be the best gal you can be    then theres confidence you cant be the best you can if you dont have the confidence to fully be your creative self through gyaru gyaru isnt something you can halfheart you have to be willing to aim for it with everything youve got and if you dont have the confidence to stand out and carry yourself you cant truly be gyaru
  well apparently 109 is promoting a 90s revival in womens fashion with the esperanza boots and a lot of leopard print etc so maybe 00s will be next
  i really believe it might and im usually good at this
  the gyaru boom of the late 2000s when the western comm was the biggest focused heavily on lower lashes that was the style at the time and a lot of western gyaru are stuck on it    nowadays it seems like lower lashes are hard to find where are you gals buying them
  vibe and makeup  if you have the vibe/mindset/feel of a gyaru youll look gyaru even in your pyjama  and makeup because even if your outfit and hair are shit if your makeup is good youll look the part    if you know how to look gyaru without lowerlashes good but a lot of girls dont know how to pull it off and will just look like any other basic ig girl so its safer
pic unrelated not going to take the pic from sng because i dont want to start a shit storm    im tired of all the other black american gyaru looking like shit honestly the blackout girls look fine and theres one other gal on the east coat who looks good but the rest of them look god awful   some of them have been in the style/community for a long time and they choose to look like shit and upload it freely    i know this sounds like a load of salt it is but im tired of them bringing the rest of our black gals image down    and yes i offer advice they just dont take it i dont care if theyre fat or naturally ugly i just wish they would actually try to look presentable for once
  everywhere has people who have been around 5ever and yet still look like shit you just seem to be noticing the black ones more is it because youre black yourself if so maybe you feel theyre misrepresenting black gyaru which is understandable but a bit ott i think these people are usually literally whos to anyone outside their country i cant think of any bad black gyaru who are still active off the top of my head i just think of the good ones like reina motoko etc if people arent good and arent obnoxious either they generally just get forgotten people only took any notice of that valentina girl because she posts every fucking day    i might block her desu pisses me off getting an sng notification and seeingthat
  tbh i can only think of 2 black gals that are like that and one of them basically has a stylistic choice for make/clothing which is indeed gal so i cant even really count her so i wonder who exactly are you talking about like i understand your frustration but you should take that frustration and be the gal thats up to your standards at the end of the day people dont have to take your advice no matter how bad they need it and if people get a generalization over a few bad looking gals then thats their problem
  samefag     im not counting newbies because theyre going to look shit by default and is still learning
  so are you good yourself
  like i understand your frustration but you should take that frustration and be the gal thats up to your standards    this is honestly the only mature way to deal with not liking how other people dress anything else is just salt
  im tired of all the other black american gyaru looking like shit honestly    i dont even know who youre on about because all the black american gyaru i see are probably some of the best in the comm
  im a black american gal and while im not the original op i can hazard a guess at who theyre talking about some people are hard to look at desu    i try not to let peoples style bother me though im too busy being my own worst critic to focus on anyone else and i would suggest the same for anon    it can be frustrating tho because i feel like when it comes to black people we are always judged by the worst of us so maybe thats why anon is so salty
  look like shit how you dont have to name names but what are they doing that you think is lowering the black gal image what advice do you give them in response
  it can be frustrating tho because i feel like when it comes to black people we are always judged by the worst of us  this is definitely truth i dont know who the original anon is talking about but thats always my first thought when i see a black gal who looks off it starts to look to outside people more ghetto/ratchet/trashy and they start to associate all of us with that no matter if most other black gals are put together  sorry for racial sperging but i feel i understand where shes coming from too black girls have a level of pride we have to keep up to be seen as decent because it only takes one fuck up to immediately confirm peoples negative ideas about us
  i think i know who op is talking about and i think they have an gal circle too i think theyre improving somewhat so no big deal
  to be honest nobody is going to fuck it up worse than delandra and yall survived that
  because it only takes one fuck up to immediately confirm peoples negative ideas about us    then stop giving a fuck about white peoples opinions all of this is just your own insecurities theres more shitty white girls posting than any shitty black girls if you think one shitty black gyaru is going to make us look bad when we have girls like matoko and reina then its youre problem    gyaru is literally the most ghetto and trashy fashion style ever and most of the style takes inspiration from black subcultures why would you think it would somehow look worse on us than any other race when one girl does it bad   if she just looks ghetto she just looks ghetto and theres nothing wrong with it if anything looking ghetto is better than looking like a 30 y/o shutin whos only just decided to come out their room because they discovered gyaru but cant even draw eyeliner
  delandra    though tbf she had the style down she was just a shit person
  oh come on shes never worn a piece of clothing that fit her in her fucking life
  true but she was undeniably gyaru
  not gonna lie she did look gyaru and blended right in with bd delandra had the trashy vibes down to a t
is noone going to tell her the skirt/belt/ whatever combo either doesnt fit her right isnt sitting right or both
  how could anyone let themselves upload this god
  ask that italian girl who uploads every frickin day will someone please ban her
  re boots i used to have a pair like these but they had winter soles and omg i would kill to have them again has anyone seen anything similar
  maybe you should that might be a good idea if she doesnt like it oh well better than coming on here and not being direct only to continue to see her look like that we all could learn to take constructive criticism and also dish it out only way youll grow
  seriously it was kind of sad at first but now its just annoying
  oh thats the chick with the gyarusa you might want to tell her and no one in her group wont tell her either their makeup is kind of bad too 109 degrees gyarusa
  maybe you should instead of posting her here    never seen the girl before and yeesh i always feel like with agejo it takes a natural eye for fashion thats why girls like lizzie pull it off even though their makeup isnt too heavy
  cmon now
  i come to cgl to escape her and you bring her right to my doorstep     good morning girls
  looks like a tranny
do you guys have any christmas meets planned    trying to decide on a location for ours
  me a lolita  i want to get into gyaru   checks out clothes on mercari gets  wig time lets look at what cyperous has  haha
  like fuck does she the trans gyaru in the comm look way better than that thing      yesss my circle is doing one and im super excited got my outfit and everything for my secret santa now
can a gal get away with not using falsies ive tried every tutorial possible and i just cannot get them on right
  no whats the problem when you put them on
  it took me probably 50 times of wearing them to finally be able to put them on right  use a lot of glue if theyre having trouble sticking literally wait like 25 seconds before putting them on after glue  use tweezers  its a skill really
  if youre not already use lashes with a thinner band sometimes band thickness can really change how well you can apply them
  honey no so try what the other anons said thinner softer band letting them dry a bit before sticking and its also important to use a decent damn glue i swear by diamond lashs own glue but daiso has a cheaper and still really good option in my experience western lash glue just doesnt cut it ive not tried anything meant for runway makeup drag queens or anything like that but definitely your standard high street glue is just not what you want for giant gal lashes    also consider trimming the length of the lash band so it fits your eye better of necessary
  yeah i was using duo for years since you tubers swore by it and i realized that it literally sucks ass
      my favorite lash glue western or not is the kiss brushon lash glue it sticks well and lasts through sleeping in your lashes or crying lol  and if you have to take your lashes off the reposition them it doesnt take all of your eyeliner off with it
  the one in the black tube thats my goto as well
  duo for years since you tubers swore by it and i realized that it literally sucks ass    so true lol i only use it now because its cheap and at primark but it takes sooo long to dry
  what do you all have planned we cant seem to decide on dinner or a private house party
  got any christmas markets near you or anything like that were doing that and then a sleepover with kigus gal movies secret santa etc
any weight loss tips i feel like im bursting out of my japanese brand clothes and its not pretty i exercise but im really bad at keeping cravings at bay  plus the holiday season and my alcohol intake in parties is killing my calorie count i feel like a fucking whale and ugh
    if you find you do more cardio switch it up and start doing more weight training itll help you burn more calories in the same amount of time and youll see some improvement    ive found that when i have an urge to binge on snacks drinking a big glass of water helps quell that
deets on the dress on the right
  its mars but im unsure of the year/season  ive seen the outfit on the left for sale but nothing of the right ill keep an eye out for you anon
this is why i wish gyaru secrets was still alive   is she using uncut top lashes for bottoms
  she looks like she belong in a dd/lg group not a gyaru one she never post any ootds nails different hair styles i mean cmon nothing about her screams gal
  it irks me that she was given advice and concrit and did nothing about it
  just check out her profile she definitely is into some kind of ddlg fetish thing gross
        ive blocked her and my sng experience is much improved just do it
    seconding the water thing i used to have a horrible sugar need but i started carrying water bottles around everywhere and drink some every time i felt like i wanted a sweet snack this and the fact that i started taking long walks every day made me lose almost 15 kg in like 810 months
  cut back on the alcohol if you have gut problems in particular id just quit drinking alcohol just makes some people inflate    also keep low calorie or healthy snacks within arms reach get all high valors snacks out of your house so theres zero temptation
  ughhh this im a somewhat alcoholic and im really trying to cut back i usually would drink like a bottle or two of vodka every weekend im hoping stopping drinking so much helps my gut
what do you guys think of these pants for amekaji gyaru theyre from aliexpress
    this girl is hardcore
  ffs i love her but come on piercings are the cheapest body modifications you can get dont risk it
  link to them
  i could be wrong but iirc piercing shops virtually do not exist in japan you have to go to hospitals to get them or do them yourself there is 1 shop i follow on instagram called gate bridge but its unique
  search for dance pants or hip hop pants on aliexpress there are tons there seems like an easy way to get amekaji sweatpants im more of an overalls skirt and jeans type but the sweatpants seem comfy also anyone see the new babyshoop collection im loving some of the looks
  i really love that jumper  i plan on buying it in hot pink and blue once i return from my trip  i wish they released a yellow as well
  here you go anon      but like  said if you search for hip hop pants / dance pants on ali you will find a lot like these
  you are very wrong theres lots of them and you dont need to do anything special to get pierced
  its normal in japan to do your own piercings or your friends piercing shops arent allowed to do the service for you but they often have seated areas in the back where you and your experienced friends can do it to each other  one piercing can easily reach 800010000yen if done by a trained professional
im surprised noones yet mentioned the gyaru superlatives here yet what did you think do you prefer them over the ggas or vice versa

why doesnt rachel from queene ever wear clothes that fit
  i dont think rachels the one youre thinking of her clothes always fit fine
  why force yourself into a too small belt  danielle always looks great and is the biggest one so i dont see what rachels excuse for this is
  eh it looks like its just bunched up with the dress isnt this the para para video its probably fine when shes not been dancing
  yeah you can see it looks fine in the other pics interesting how the queene girls always attract so much ott salt

  okay pls marry me
everyone compliments and takes photos of your costume people are genuinely excited which makes me excited like i love it when people get excited over it since making them happy makes me happy  nobody posts it to insta after and i get hit with a weird pang    it was great then but why do i feel so empty is this jealousy
  same
  can do where you at
  i feel exactly the same i had so many people stop and ask for photos yet i didnt see a single one online or even get posted to the facebook group of the con feelsbadman
    are you guys really scrolling through the thousands of photos in con tags chances are you missed it or they didnt post it i dont post any of the photos i take
my dream dress slipped away right before my eyes so so close im pretty heartbroken
  im the anon who responded but the con i went to is relatively small and not very big around here so tags on places like tumblr werent very populated or very outdated    and yes thats what were discussing/complaining about how no one out of all the people who stopped us posted a photo    reading comprehension are hard
i used to be stupid and use shitty bar soap on my face browsing cgl got me interested in skincare and also taught me that seeing skincare as girly is an amerifag thing and most asian men take really good care of my skin now i use soap designed for my face exfoliate and moisturize i feel really smooth and handsome   thanks cgl
man i just really hate feminism    man i just really hate sweet lolita
browsing /cgl/ feel threads helped me realize that realize that relationships are a waste of time and energy and that the only way to truly live is fast and carefree regardless the price    thank you gulls
man i just really wish i wasnt depressed all the time
  fast and carefree  still browsing /cgl/  caring what gulls say about their relationships
  not knowing why foxes and grapes are paired  have you not read aesops fables then  
  yes and why would they post the photos very few people post the photos they take of cosplayers in tags its usually people posting pictures of themselves or for photoshoots    the con i went to is relatively small   then the chance of that happening is even lower why are you upset
  its been 40 minutes how does it feel to be ghosted by the love of your life
  since i participate in those skincare threads this response makes me so happy
  thats great for you  /cgl/ has really helped me find my sense of style no longer just wearing generic walmart tshirt and jeans for me
man i just really love shitposting
  man i just really love holding my gfs hand while she shits
    honestly i dont know how a 4chan meetup would work its scary meeting some guy off this website of all places plus the likelihood of being in the same city is abysmal at best
  dont worry its 4channel now
  i have been to a few at cons you got the splurgs and the normal people the trick is to wait around for a bit so the autistd fuck off and then go and hang out with the leftovers eat out dealers room or i go to my hotel room drink and play mario kart everyone loves mario kart
only ate omelette today nothing else  not hungry  diet cycles have fucked my appetite up  likely wont eat until tomorrow night  idk also no im not underweight still kind of skinnyfat
  i wouldnt worry unless your consistently not eating your body is probably just compensating for a day you ate more on
  gulls are pretty harmless in my experience at least around where i am at worst youre dealing with a legit sperg but youll probably never have to worry about physical harm befalling you just tell that anon the nearest major city to you so you can determine whether or not youre half a world away  best case scenario you get yourself a qt bf to buy you burando/make cosplays with you and cuddle whenever you want
my comm mother learned a harsh lesson treat your man right or some thot will steal him    i am that thot
when is the best time to confess your love
  never
  when youre completely certain your feelings are reciprocated
  i cant be certain in this case i know there is some form of attraction but i will never be able to verify if there is enough
  see 
  it doesnt have to be a completely direct animelike confession you do need confirmation but you can approach the topic more indirectlyi was planning on using something like this but never got to  we should hang out more know what i mean  but do you actually know what i mean because if you dont feel about me like that just say you have your eyes on someone else even if its a lie and well leave it at that
  i cringed please dont do this
  i cant tell if shes just being flirty with me for fun or she really means it    shes also a long way away
  tfw 25 and still cant recognize flirting  is it over for me
  do you really have something to lose by simply asking her that or as it sounds would you regret it if you didnt ask
  shes also a long way away  dont do it 99 of women cant handle being in a long distance relationship and will just cheat on you ldrs are not worth wasting your time and love on
  im literally autistic and cant understand sarcasm or flirting very well at all so when i say flirting i mean like very explicit flirting its hard not to notice when youre being beaten over the head with it      if its premature and i cant see her in time to solidify her attitude towards me if she reciprocates my feelings i feel like maybe her feelings would fade or she would reconsider if im unable to see her in time      i know ldrs are a gamble this girl is a gamble
  theyre not a gamble theyre more akin to playing the lottery you have so little chance of it turning out well that it might as well not exist
  almost like most relationships then
  if youre worried about that you could agree on a date to meet up with her that would build anticipation even if it had to be weeks away
  we live about 20 hours away by plane its not so easy or cheap
  yeah i wrote under that assumption if its that important to you both then you should be able to figure something out together i dont like living with regrets so i dont think simply worrying about it will solve anything for you until you take some decisive action
  the difference is inperson relationships can be decided much quicker and be much more fulfilling overall even if they dont end well ldrs are 90 talking through webcams never having any idea if youre the only one and meeting up to fuck for a weekend every couple months overall theyre incredibly draining for very little reward      when i say flirting i mean like very explicit flirting its hard not to notice when youre being beaten over the head with it  youre lucky then ive never had girls come at me that hard and only learn they were flirting or trying to from a third party days later
  right before you finish bricking them into the wall    not that id know or anything
  i enjoy talking to her genuinely ive never met a person so worldly before it just gives me lots of anxiety and stress that if i dont do something shes going to get taken away from me or lose interest but if i do something to soon she might back out thinking things got too serious and that she was only fooling around    ive had a relationship go ldr for a year and i would drive 20 hours every weekend to see her speak on the phone every night its hard but i love knowing someone is there for me    all girls that ive had romantic encounters with have basically had to pseudo sexually assault me because they got so frustrated that im so dense apparently i flirt back but to me i just match the person whos talking to me if they compliment me i compliment them it only seems polite and friendly
    20 hours by plane  wait are you the anon whos in love with the drugaddled poly broad didnt we tell you its a terrible idea and you need to move on
  relationships are a waste of time and energy      what foxes and grapes
  yes    i cant move on feelings are feelings i cant help that
  drink anon drink until you forget  you could also spend your next con talking to every cute girl you see one is bound to strike your fancy just dont do what i used to do and endlessly dwell on what you know can never be its not good for you
  i dont drink unfortunately     i want her and i want to try i just have no idea how to go about this the fact that she already has a boyfriend just makes this all the more confusing i think she likes him but keeps him around a placeholder they dont even live together and she lives by herself i wouldnt be able to share her so id have to give her an ultimatum    i didnt want to fall for her it just happened and she keeps pouring fuel on the fire
  i wouldnt be able to share her so id have to give her an ultimatum    this would backfire big time anon
  just tell her how you feel with the assumption that nothing will ever come of it
    yeah thats the worst possible thing you could do  just ask yourself if you can date a literal hooker because thats basically what dating a poly girl is like if the answer is no then you know what to do
  are you implying anyone would be jealous of the relationships discussed here even the good ones are boring as fuck and require too much effort
  she was an escort previously so she calls her currently relationship open but so far shes been monogamous so i dont know nobody is perfect    all i know is that i like her very much and ive never met anyone like her i know that sounds cliche but i actually havent i cant categorise her she crosses so many different archetypes with so many idiosyncrasies lots of dichotomy and seemingly conflicting interests and ideas im scared ill never find another one like her and shell be the one who got away
  i am a little jealous
  yeah im just under the impression that every relationship discussed here is either fake or wildly exaggerated
  i dont know how to tell you this but shes basically playing you shes a manipulator not necessarily out of malice but it was part of her former job and shes an addict manipulation is her bread and butter  escorts dont just take cash and get fucked they play a role that conforms to whatever the customer wants theyre basically onthefly actors  again im not saying shes trying to con you or anything but she seems so appealing to you because shes likely playing the character you want her to be        im also a bit jealous sleeping alone sucks especially during winter
    i hate sharing a room with someone else and i dont like being touched so ill probably never understand desu
  i can understand not wanting to share a room but not being touched what kind of soulless robot doesnt like hugs
  the kind that posts on a taiwanese fingerpainting forum
  im the other jealous anon but i dont inherently like hugs either it depends entirely who the hug is with
  i might be in this situation again so if you have any better ideas id gladly hear them
  we should hang out more know what i mean  but do you actually know what i mean    all i see are sure lets fuck and eeww no responses to this
  i figured this all out for myself itd be no surprise to hear im doing it wrong so im not too proud to take advice that said  if i ever have to say something like that its because i need to know if the other party is interested in me romantically i cant go home with any kind of doubt i wouldnt be planning to fuck on the spot like youre suggesting but for better or worse either answer you gave there would do
im considering to break up with gf of three years i just feel im not that much into girls as i thought i am i tried to kinda convert myself but it didnt work out i need to just stop lying to her and wasting her time
  are these two related
  tell us more gull
  idk what more what would you like to know
  youre considering that implies you havent decided so whats holding you back
  this order exactly   i dont want to be back to dating men in my circumstances it would be humiliating    more than likely i will stay alone for real long bc i dont have other social connections but her   shes actually kind extremely chill and adequate person theres a chance i wont meet anyone better than her
  i dont want to be back to dating men in my circumstances it would be humiliating    did you renounce men publicly or something
  in what way are you not that much into girls romantically sexually or both if the former talk to her about transitioning to something more fwb if the second talk about doing an open relationship or just being best friends if the latter you should probably just be friends
  apparently not it seems ive been knee deep in grimms tales but hardly anything else might be a regional or languagerelated reason for the popularity/unpopularity im from sweden for reference    tfw ordered both colourways  tfw free shipping  tfw will be able to make friends twin with me    the grapes of disappointment may be sour but the grapes of satisfaction are ever do sweet thanks for linking that page anon
  no not at all i deal with a lot of pressure on marriage my family talks a lot about this people from my work act the same they all act like my whole life is supposed to be dedicated to marriage and giving birth i used to feel that attitude like that devalues me like its impossible to keep dignity after getting married because you have to accept most of things your husband wants you to do you know i felt that dating a woman is like dating someone of equal social status they wont blame you for making more money or having sexual experiences in the past
  aesop was ancient greek so if your schooling didnt cover ancient greece thats probably why
  you just havent found the right guy yet is normally stupid advice thrown at lesbians by people who dont want to accept their sexuality but in your case i think it holds true
  maybe youre right i shall admit once i was into guy to the point i wanted to have his kid although im basically dont like them it was quite irrational and emotional drive tho we wasnt even dating properly at the moment
im an anon who posted a few threads back about being in a loveless relationship with a long term bf and stuff i took everyones advice and i broke off my dead relationship moved back home with my mom for now and currently finding my own place to rent im doing mentally better in such a short period of time and feel happier slowly the guy i was talking to during those few weeks is helping me with my studies and motivating me in styling myself better and taking care of my skin and eating habits too    thanks to all the anons here that convinced me to break it off im better off slowly improving finding a new job and it looks good anons good feels right now
  wow you did great heres to your future
  people say this about her but i dont understand it what is she manipulating out of me attention money
  attention sage
    i dont get it either isnt she giving you just as much attention
  girl who was an escort and already has a million beta orbiters is wasting time on a guy 20 hours away by making each other music playlists and shit talking about anime because she wants attention    that would only indicate she values my attention quite a lot
  or maybe youre not the only one
  is that it   sorry dude youre not special  just ask   sage
  its possible but doubt when i can message her at anytime as long as shes awake we can chat for hours if shes doing that with multiple people whilst maintaining a boyfriend a job and a normal life then i have no shame in being used    if im being misled by her i cant blame myself however im not asking whether or no im being misled im asking whens the best time to tell her that i am attracted to her as a potential partner
  right now before you invest any more time into her
  i dont feel thats going to increase my chances of her saying yes im not exactly short of time to spare on people and i enjoy speaking with her
tfw peacockalorum goes on vacation the day after you order from her    i should have looked up what happens in england this time of year
  im not exactly short of time to spare on people    so youre a loner
  im the same anon who posted his face with a censor on his eyes a while ago i do nothing but go to work go to uni go to gym i dont like to go outside and i have trouble making friends so a loner is accurate
  let me rephrase right now before you invest any more emotional energy into her
  i suppose thats a better way of putting but the premise remains i dont care about time or energy i care about the success rate of her accepting my confession
  slim to none regardless of the timing
  its zero    im telling you this as a chronically ill bored lonely girl who chats to 40 men every single day it isnt hard to have those conversations it isnt hard to seem incredibly invested in each one i have to otherwise they wont give me that time plus men are pretty dumb and think actual human connection is much less shallow than it really is so i only have to put in about 10 of the effort of having a conversation with a girl    the girl youre speaking with is absolutely talking to other guys in the same manner the fact that she hasnt even expressed any outward romantic feelings to you should be the most obvious indicator of that
tfw guys would rather date a heroin addicted whore than you
  i havent said so but she has expressed outward romantic feelings towards me    the first time i figured this out was when she was high on heroin and became extremely horny and desperately tried to solicit dick pics out of me to masturbate to which i said no she has complimented my appearance a lot of times she plays out her fantasies with me she has asked me to fly to her country multiple times    however because of her unique personality i cant tell whether or not these are just for funsies or she actually means it i would feel like a bit of retard if i was the person taking all this semiseriously and she was just fucking around      if you have a stellar personality then you can be anything and guys will still like you
  it sounds like youre projecting
  those are not romantic feelings those are sexual feelings they are not one in the same she can want to fuck you without caring about you      im just recognising my own shitty behaviour in others there might be a bit of projecting but there are plenty of things that ive seen him talk about that are spot on to what im saying
  i appreciate your advice but i do feel differently because of our interactions obviously i cant post everything we have said to each other but i feel there are romantic feelings there she has said she feels like we are a lot alike which i agree with and we have shared a lot of similar experiences except that she is older than me and has experienced more im early twenties shes midlate twenties but i just find that makes her more attractive    if not then i got played which sucks and i go back to being a total loner with only male internet friends but oh well the feelings are nice given i havent felt this way about any girl before even the ones who try to speak to me irl
  well put yourself out there and see what happens
  about any girl before     any girl before for a long time
  she has said she feels like we are a lot alike which i agree with and we have shared a lot of similar experiences except that she is older than me and has experienced more    do you not realise how generic these statements are this is what i mean when i say that men require only 10 of the effort that girls do when it comes to conversation going haha anon we have so much in common 3 is not a real connection it does not take any effort or thought
  again i cant post everything we have nor do i really want to go into specific detail about everything when she has we are alike its been after discussing things that have gone on in our lives shes spoken about her personality disorders ive spoken about mine weve spoken about family abandonment being fucked over by ex partners how we experience feelings of love and how we express them i have a desire to do drugs she does a lot of drugs etc etc    i feel these arent surface level or vain conversations
  then fuck her already and shut up about it jesus christ
  shes spoken about her personality disorders ive spoken about mine  i have a desire to do drugs she does a lot of drugs  this will not end well
  why are you so mean to men
  are you retarded if i just wanted sexual gratification out of her ive practically almost got it i dont particularly care about that my entire question is when is the best time to tell her that our interactions have made me develop a crush on her and i would like to have a romantic relationship with her moving forward    then anons have questioned my interactions with her which ive given further explanation      being honest i felt i missed out on a lot growing up and being a young adult because of my family life and mental issues so now i just want someone to unironically fuck me up as if nothing matters to make up for lost time you only get to be young once
  then do it already    stop being a coward and crying about shit on an anonymous image board and just tell her you fuck    what do you want us to write your confession for you as well
  are you still not getting it im not asking whether or not to do it ive already accepted in my mind i have to tell her otherwise the feelings will eat me alive the issue is timing    are you actually fucking illiterate
  you know since you know her best personally shouldnt you already know what the best time to tell her would be
  there is nothing to be gained by waiting tell her now and post results
  im smart enough to know im an idiot and would like to get the advice of people who may have been in similar situations before      shes asleep telling her now and having to wait hours for her to wake up would cause anxiety which is going to turn me into a wreck
  tell her when she wakes up and is awake enough to take it all in    maybe wait until her evening so shes all settled down and ready to talk about it    just be ready that her answer might not be as rosy as you might expect not sure what you expect though    whatever happens i hope you can get yourself together man this coming from someone that has been abandoned time and time again without any chance for closure
  so she has personality disorders does a lot of drugs isnt monogamous has a suspect past is far away from you and doesnt show any romantic feelings towards you and your brain still thinks you should pursue this      because my ex put me in a wheelchair and now i feel both unlovable by men and above them all so this is my way of getting their attention to prove im worth loving and also to manipulate and laugh at them behind their backs    im well aware that its shitty
  im sorry that happened to you and this is the way you decided to cope with it
people are still feeding the cuck and indulging him over his pathetic story
  what would constitute romantic feelings    everything else i can throw out the window because of her personality i also have a thing for girls who are just as if not more damaged than me it makes me feel less alone and like someone understands dont get me wrong if it were anyone else id be disgusted by the drugs by her sleeping around for money by the idea of open relationships and wouldnt even consider an ldr    but there is something about her that makes me not care or even makes those things attractive i also see her as a way out of my current life which i hate i am bored lonely hate everyone i hate the country i live in i hate the girls here i hate the person i am here i have no friends i have a very small amount of family that i speak to literally just my mother i just want to do heroin with her and live a lovely life with her melting into each other
  thanks me too      the fact that you dont know if she has romantic feelings for you is proof that she hasnt shown it that should be obvious    everything else i can throw out the window because of her personality    these things are indicative of her personality how do you not understand that
  post contact info
  because my ex put me in a wheelchair  did he tombstone piledrive you the wrong way or something
  the problem is because of her personality i dont know if the things she says are indicative of romance if it were anyone else itd be clear as day    please move to canada so we can be cute couple and we can even twin our outfits    that to me if it were any other girl would be clear as day but because of situation and the person saying it i cant be sure    these things are indicative of her personality how do you not understand that  her personality is not completely submersed in drugs and sex i like her personality for how direct she is how she feels like a real person how she share the same interests we have similar goals in life how i feel she actually listens to me the advice she gives me works and is thought out because shes been there before etc etc you seem really hellbent on convincing me she is just a manipulating drugged up whore to what effect im not sure
  why      he pushed me i fell against the table i hit my neck in just the right spot and now i cant walk it seems like things should be more complicated than that but they arent      okay youre right and everyone else here is wrong go move to canada to wear matching outfits with your drug addicted ecrush who will definitely leave her long term real relationship to explore something with someone who cant even legally live in her country youve figured it all out and were the fools
  i never wanted people to try and convince me out of this i just want people to tell me when for fuck sake and share their experiences
just go be with her and overdose with her m8 so we dont have to read any more of your cringey as fuck posts and have you shit up multiple threads
  people have already answered your questions you miserable man now leave
  will do i wont post about her again sorry to shit up the thread      reeee why wont people accept my unsolicited advice
  i dont like the number 40
  this was actually a good response and it makes me wish i wasnt so emotionally broken so that i could have a genuine conversation
  reeee why wont people accept my unsolicited advice  yikes anon i wasnt even one of the people that gave you advice i stepped in to tell you to get the fuck out because youve gotten enough attention for your retarded problem you already know what to do
tfw no crippled seagull gf to cuddle playfully tease and lift onto your cock
  she probably doesnt feel anything down there
  he pushed me  did you sue him is he in jail tell me more
  i dont mind a disingenuous one
  even better my girth is painful for most women
  my penis when measured around is nearly twice the norm the vagina can stretch this much safely but without experience doing so its typically painful therefore its a good thing that she lacks feeling in her vagina because we could have vaginal sex without pain
  i still have sensation in my genitals but i do have difficulty staying wet so lots of lube would be needed      hes in jail yes suing would have been pointless as he doesnt have any real amount of money and the less i ever have to see or hear of him again the better      but then whats the point if both of us know the conversation has no real meaning or truth to it then why do it    and honestly i dont know how id feel about someone im talking to actually knowing that im in a wheelchair i hide that from everyone
  rpers are so embarrassing
when some faggot hijacks your wholesome feel about wanting to be close to your cripplechan to talk about the size of his micropenis    where do you live
  canada    why are you interested in disabled girls
  because the only disingenuous part of the conversation will be in pretending its not genuine
  i dont have a specific fetish for disabled girls i just think it would be something different ive never dated someone who was physically disabled that and i like to dote on my romantic partners in general
want to get into lolita  too ugly  want to get back into cosplay  too ugly hate every single photo that was taken of me back when i still did cosplay  _ why am i cursed with interests that dont work for me why cant i just be into something else that doesnt require a pretty face
  cosplay characters who wear masks of helmets or are ugly
  anon it sucks do not be a coward and talk about it with your partner
  you probably have heard at least the expression stemming from it but the swedish version of the fable has rowanberries instead of grapes surt sa räven om rönnbären
  damaged girls are cute    do you live in saskatoon
  make a joke about something not serious at all  get notification from 4chanx the next day  not sure if response is roleplaying or serious
  i fell asleep like 3 minutes after i posted that so it didnt feel too bad hhaha
  after a rejection like that you must have extreme willpower and mental resolve or narcolepsygood luck to you in your unprovoked and forever unreciprocated /cgl/ love quest
  order facial lotion a month ago   tfw im never getting it now   aaaaaaaa
  im sure theres plenty of gem posters that can help you out with some warm sticky facial lotion
  youre completely right i have several times    is this proof that ancient greece still lives on without any particular notice
  omg you guys look great i normally dislike slice of life romantic comedies but that series was great      what  said if your body needs food you will get hungry you dont have to force it being hungry all the time is worse because your insulin/ghrelin signals are all messed up and an omlette is one of the most filling foods you can eat most days thats my main meal      unsolicited  youre literally soliciting opinions from people what even youre not even taking their advice for that matter you ask when to tell her people say now or dont at all that is an answer thats literally the mass opinion of this board i agree with them plus i think youre delusional because youre lonely sorry man either have the balls to go for it now because there is no good time that will make a difference here or just stop while youre ahead you have so many problems already i cant see this working out even if you guys are soulmates or something youre both a mess
i didnt make any friends at the con and now im sad im too terrified to approach people without seeming weird or awkward
  youre literally soliciting opinions from people  thank you hopefully that anon is gone now
  im not gone i just got told to shut up so i did i dont feel im getting the type of answers i desired which was ldr confession stories so theres no point continuing
  go away
  sorry while it sounds nice in theory i dont even know how to have a real conversation anymore if its not being calculated at every step to get what i want from someone then i dont know how to talk to people i suck      you seem like a nice person      thankfully no
  warm   please dont keep your lotion bottle near the heater fellow gems the heat will destroy the nutrients
  you seem like a nice person  thanks anon you seem cool yourself i like the fact that youre upfront about everything thats happened to you itd be nice to chat to you some more
  its easy on here when its all anonymous i cant be like this with anyone onetoone though and i barely leave my house so that doesnt really require much honesty when it comes to real life interactions
  its still better than nothing and im sure being like that with someone oneonone could change in time
  if youre really that calculating and adept at manipulating people perhaps you could help me out with a problem i have
  man hmu when youre done with your appointment
  itd be nice to be able to have a real conversation with someone but i dont know when that would be able to happen id like to go back to being able to but who knows if that will happen      i dont think im some mastermind at it 4chan boys arent really the most complicated of people to trick but i can always try to help if you want
  well let me know if youd want to give it a try
  id appreciate it see im interested in talking to this anon but she seems reluctant to share her contact details to convince her to change her mind what should be my next step
i have 3 exams in like 2 weeks and i really dont know how i will make it im studying everyday for the whole day and im just so tired
  employ good sleep hygiene sleeping well will make you more productive and better at studying
  will do      have you considered posting about it repeatedly and then ignoring every piece of advice you get all while claiming you never asked for any advice it seems to be the thing to do around here    that and gemposting
i want to hold hands with all the gemposters
man i just really hate my job
do some cosplay photography just as a hobby  become good friends with one of the cosplayers over the years  very sweet person does not have that certain toxic streak ive been noticing in other cosplayers  hang out more and more together share secrects and whatnot  reveal to her ive been wanting to go brolita show my wardrobe she helps with makeup goes to events with me to make things less nervewracking  cant help but start falling in love with her  know its no good because shes a lesbian which ive been aware of basically since the day weve met    not quite a tf when no gf kind of feel because true friends are rare so i should cherish what we already have going but it does get painful from time to time
  it did cross my mind but i suspect that would only invoke her ire and while that might be temporarily amusing it somehow seems counterproductive so im going to have to ignore your advice and ask again despite never asking in the first place
  sure bro
  how are gem things in australia
  not a good idea rn
  sure
      my job here is done i can sleep peacefully
  nayrt but im also in studyhell and it really felt nice to read this solid advice while procrastinating a little in the feels thread    on the topic of hygiene how vital is cosmetic hygiene according to you ive been down in the dumps and let my eyebrows run wild and its lightly bugging me whenever im in the bathroom its an easy fix now that i think about it but i just havent been bothered i write after admitting to procrastination    somebody please shame me
  thanks thats good advice ill do my best
  tweeze your eyebrows karen seriously though youll probably get some boosts of dopamine and confidence from feeling better about your appearance      youre welcome if youre having trouble sleeping regularly start taking magnesium glycinate supplements a couple of hours before bed it makes your going to sleep 10x easier and better
friend on fb tags me on some post of idk page where someone asks where to buy lolita knowing i wear it  write full length reply with different shops both brand and offbrand and shops to stay off and why  go read other replies  filled with recommendations of replica sellers bodyline and even a literal recommendation of millanoo  i feel like i waisted my time should have checked before hand  well thats was demotivating for spending time in helping normies but maybe at least some newbie reads it and cares not to buy replicas or from sexual predators but i just decided to assume 99 of those replieers think i must be an elitist meanie as most itas defending replicas and such do towards those who have decency not to promote stolen art
  i want to princess carry the gemposters
  because i knew exactly what to expect and was still disappointed let me have this anon
gemposters be sure to wax
  think you can carry all of this
  yeah i looked through quite a bit    its just crushing to see absolutely terrible overweight cosplayers with terrible or no wigs shit cardboard props and shitty basic bitch bought costumes that they forget to iron get reposted all the time after youve put in meticulous work to make sure your shit is impeccable and accurate ive had people compliment my costume since they wore the same character and ask for tips on construction and wigs and then i go on insta and see them with thousands of followers and hundreds of likes    like its genuinely so so disheartening why put in all the time to research and sew your stuff several times if someone can put in a fraction of the effort and get several times greater result or they can be an average looking girl with a partycity tier costume and get swarmed    i initially got into cosplaying because it was fun to make stuff and see stuff others made so its weird for me to feel so jealous of people who made it i feel like its petty to want the affirmation from insta after people compliment it nonstop in person but i guess thats what it is
ive become a horrible person due to lurking too much cgl im judgemental hateful and overly sensitive
i let my bf use 4chan because he wanted to learn cosplay but now hes too 4chan    he keeps calling my tits milkers and my butt a brapper he keeps calling every fat person we see a hambeast and all his friends kucks wtf do i do    i want him to cosplay sailor moon chars with me at yamacon but not if hes like this
  dont worry someone will be around in a minute to ask if you want to be their gf
  you said you were a man before elsafunposter dont fucking do this to me
  i stole his picture because i am a frozen cosplayer
  thats fair enough still you should dump him and let me be your prince endymion
  that sounds like a challenge
  i dont mind having hairy legs though
  were not talking about legs
one of my cosplay friends just posted a selfie with a pacifier in their mouth i cant tell if its an autism thing a rave thing or if theyre a disgusting ageplayer
gems are smooth all over be sure to be smooth like a gem
tfw all these gay binery gender bull everyone thinks every girl are now bois  its seriously makes me insecure over my body
  armpits then seems like a nitpick  painful
sad and little mad bc missed a dd bc bf cant finance  happens every month  not any better myself tho  i feel sad for the dress but i feel more sad i cant afford to get help for him his depressed and something in his self confidence is super fucked up he is trying to get help but no one cares for him and i cant afford to pay for all of his therapy gotta study hard so in the future we can have both the therapy and all the brand i could possibly want
  ok but i cant do anything about my muscles
  you have to be over 18 to post on this site
  one time a possibly drunk dia said sensei likes em smooth in reference to a conversation about shaving legs or something  your shitpost made me remember that thanks
  ugh this seriously many girls who once looked perfectly attractive to me now instinctively flag as possibly a dude which is instantly a turnoff    im sorry anon nobody wanted this
itt transphobia
  not being transphobic  fuck off tranny
        please go have your gender critical debate on lolcow and let us gulls shitpost in peace
  implying hating trannies and sissies isnt a treasured seagull pastime  newfag
its incredible how one word is enough to derail a whole thread i love 4channel
man i just really hate sissy trannies and agps
  based and redpilled
  bf cant finance  is he making poor spending decisions not properly budgeting for therapy and then you have to pick up the slack if thats the case maybe sit down with him and make an excel spreadsheet with a weekly or monthly budget for him and then encourage him to stick with it i had to do that with my bf a couple of times  youre a sweet person for paying for his therapy i understand its frustrating but dresses will come and go while your bf is irreplaceable i hope your dd gets relisted when finances are better for you
  now instinctively flag as possibly a dude  thats literally my fetish i exclusively find androgynous people attractive i think masculine and feminine people are super ugly  im also gender critical so finding someone who is androgynous and also thinks gender is a stupid concept is difficult ironically androgynous people tend to care more about gender than literally any other group of people i dont get it
  no the notorious vag
  implying that sexless space gems with no need to reproduce have genitals   sorry to ruin your fantasy but theyre smooth like ken dolls down there
  that is weird youd think theyd just roll with whatever pronouns people end up using      im sorry anon nobody wanted this  ok fine this particular asshole wanted this the rest of us are miserable also apparently so is that asshole because the androgynous people are not chill about it we all suffer equally
  he meant your bussy

  jesus christ that pic
  jesus anon i know what its like to put all your eggs in one basket but you really took it to a new level what city is so godawful that you have to get out yesterday and what city is so much better i swear to god if youre moving from california to washington ill find you and take you back myself
  i dont live in gommiefornia thankfully where i live is just shitty is all also i vote red you should beg me to move to your state  i mean i had the idea of moving somewhere else as a backup plan and logically speaking id be better off this way just i wanted to go live the weeb dream and be a fashionable tokyoite and all that   ah well now i need to go crazy making this move as fast as possible
  no japanese man would have married you and almost no teaching jobs are in tokyo you really didnt plan any of this out lmao and your back up plan isnt even a plan its a plan to plan a bunch of new things    yikes
  the school literally had like 7 branches in tokyo not everything is jet and yes the largest city in the country has people who want to pay to take english classes   go eat a snickers you grumpy creature
  also i vote red  in that case youre welcome any time move in with me and my cousin we need to get out of our shitty apartment and into a house but we need at least a third person    also like  said pretty much all of the english teaching jobs in japan are way out in bumfucknowhere and youll wind up spending 99 of your free time alone whats more is the pay is actual garbage and youre not even an actual teacher youre a ta who really only exists to perform english youre more of a dancing monkey than anything else  if you really want to live in japan learn japanese and work a trade thats indemand over there and maybe theyll give you a work visa but for the love of god dont do jet or whatever
    what the actual fuck did i just read    it feels too real to be a troll
  this is kind of cringe sorry you got rejected from a single job application but calm down your post reads like some psychotic fever dream
  but for the love of god dont do jet or whatever  why not heard the pay was good
  the pay can be good for an english gig compared to any native job in japan though it sucks you will be poor you will have very little free time you wont be in charge of the class or have any say in what is being taught  seriously go read some of the lessfavorable accounts of teaching english in japan its not like it was 1015 years ago when the demand outweighed supply
  im aware of the dancing monkey bit and only alt are in inaka eikaiwa exist in large cities primarily because its a business not just a school  move in  where wa soseattle honestly might i want a room in a shared house to save more money did the own apartment thing here and got screwed on rent so sick of it     im just venting so of course i sound like that but it is upsetting that interview was hell too
  not seattle were about 40ish miles north where housing is somewhat affordable but not far enough to be out of solidblue country  were not picky people if you can make rent on time and dont make a giant mess we dont really care who you are or what you do so long as you dont bring any sketchy people or activity home with you
  just to offer you a friendly alternative anon springfield mo has the lowest cost of living in the us relative to income you can expect to receive here      its also super red theres a couple local cons but ill be honest theyre shit and flying out anywhere that isnt chicago dallas or vegas is kinda expensive but its otherwise an incredibly charming place and wed be happy to show you around if you ever wanted to meet up    its a humble place but its more comfy than any big city ive ever been
helping my hoarder bf clean his apartment so his mom can come over  its like trying to polish a turd     some of the stuff hes hoarding are cosplays so i guess this counts as a /cgl/ feel  i just needed to anonymously vent though desu
    getting roommates off of /cgl/  sounds good
  dude i cant afford to be picky its this or craigslist and id honestly trust a conservative gull over literally anybody in the seattle area any day of the week
i accidentally spent 250 on lacemarket and now i cant get my bf a ps4 with spiderman for christmas
tfw no lolita gf
    im one of those shitbags who wants to live directly downtown in a major city despite being a trump voter i just really love big cities man my job also isnt ruralfriendly typically i work in those skyscrapers as a cubicle slave so those locations wont work plus midwest weather would kill me thank you for the offer and advice though really craigslist isnt awful ive gotten several housing arrangements off there and didnt even get raped yet just dont trust anyone who says theyre a single mom or seems like a drug user and youll be alright  or idk maybe the kids have a more trendy website now for roommates    pic rel
  just suck a few dicks anon you can make that in an afternoon if you wanted to
  i understand its not for everyone though you might like it more than you think if you ever gave it a shot i for one cant stand the urban jungle and its a lions den for red staters oh well  back to being alone in my comfy town  so completely alone
  im one of those shitbags who wants to live directly downtown in a major city  i mean cool if you dont mind stepping on heroin needles every morning seattle legitimately employs people to sweep heroin needles off the street at like 4am because there are piles of them and living next to a homeless camp youre also not going to find a major city anywhere in the country where having an average job can match the cost of living  depending on what your job is you can probably find something closer than seattle  i like cities too but ill be damned if i can find one worth actually living in
  i am a fatty chan
  i now remember cal anderson park this past august  i lived in seattle from 20112015 what the fuck happened
    im used to it i live in a major city now i just despise this one for reasons the downtown part is great though i really do wish i lived somewhere bigger and denser like manhattan but man i cant afford that shit theres tons of hobos probably a top 5 hobo city so im familiar with it  but man i just really love tall buildings and rail transit   ive told people im a trump voter here liberal city and their reactions are amusing not like they grab a pitchfork but you see the mental double take happen in real time and they start tripping over themselves people just think its quirky ive never really had a bad reaction   actually i went full 1488 with one guy and he found it endearing and hilarious full hitler did nothing wrong and he loved the routine despite being a bluepiller its really not as bad as /pol/ makes it seem
  suck a few more
i had a quickie with a dude that had a beard and i keep finding random strands in my jsk plus it smells like his beard oil now and it keeps giving me the butterflies
  amazon moved in the rents skyrocketed and all the blue collar people couldnt afford rent anymore
  are you cute you can get away with a lot when youre cute
  hairy men
  thats kinda gross
    this but also californians decided that washington was the best place to go for some reason when they couldnt afford to live in california anymore they all moved up and brought their shitty politics and ideas with them their shitty ideas influenced the city and state governments so then seattle pd gets neutered and the city starts catering to drug addicts and the homeless other major cities quickly got wind of this and began going to their own homeless camps and handing out free bus tickets to seattle i shit you not this is actually what happened so then wave after wave of heroin and methaddicted hobos start rolling into town and setting up camp apparently a tent under a bridge or in some other inconspicuous unused area is too unsightly for the folks on the city council so they took it upon themselves to spend taxpayer money filling empty lots with tiny houses and giving them to the drugaddles hobos absolutely free of charge so now you have blocks where 50 heroin addicts are living rentfree right next door to an apartment complex or a small business oh and the whole time this is happening you have sketchilyfunded volunteer groups setting up needle exchanges and safe injection sites to make sure the heroin addicts dont accidentally kill themselves the needle exchanges quickly became needle distribution centers originally youd turn in so many needles and theyd give you the same number of clean needles now you can just walk up and say i need x number of needles and theyll give you however many you want which is how we ended up with literal piles of used needles all over the place      if you insist on seattle or nothing i wont stop you but i strongly suggest you consider living up north where i am and commuting we even have a light rail line that starts like 20 miles north of seattle and runs all the way through down to i dont even know where
  sorry we cant all be twinks      beard oil  did you tell him afterwards that you should both try seeing other men
  friendly reminder that downtown seattle is a deathtrap that nobody can afford to fix so theyre waiting for everything to collapse so they can get fema to rebuild it    seattle is a bunch of skyscrapers with zero earthquake proofing built on top of the city ruins that burned down 100 years ago which then sank into the foundation of sawdust and mudflats all of which is built on top of the intersection of three fault lines    there will be an earthquake and skyscrapers will fall but all the newer amazon buildings arent going to be affected so its not like theyre keen on paying enough taxes to retrofit the entire city which nobody can otherwise afford
qt coworker wouldnt actually talk to me hes ran away everytime ive tried talking to him    i found out days later hes quitting and got a different job not related to me at all i guess he just didnt want to break the news to me he had made banter with me before about searching for a new job but i didnt expect him to do it and just stop speaking with me     or i am that insufferable and no one will tell me anyways i spent about 500 dollars on 3 new dresses an usakumya a new pair of shoes and a bonnet so you can say im doin okay
  thank you for the daily reminder that californians are human garbage
  no he tried to go public health care once again and no help we cant afford for anything better for now he like cant budget at all and buys stupid shit i cant work and he cant work full time and i would be okay with that but somehow he relies on me putting all my extra money into saving the situation they are not big fuck ups bc we are pretty poor but fucking every month cant save for anything sometimes i just think if i should kick him out but fuck im miserably in love with him and would pay for him the rest of his life
  im sorry it worked out that way gull but this entire saga smacks of two people with zero communication skills any relationship wouldve been doomed from the start
  androgynous people tend to care more about gender than literally any other group of people i dont get it  maybe because they dislike being mislabled constantly just because their body happened to look like it could be the other gender its kinda one of those those i understand your mistake but its still fucking annoying kinda things caring a lot about gender is a way to prevent that    im kinda done with every idiot and his friend being trans ive got no chill for sissies trying to be lolita but the few actually trans and the people who are androgeniuos i know actually just want to be scene as one gender and just life their lives i can understand the annoyance especially when people keep making it a big deal when you just want to live your life without people doubting you shouldnt get changed to the other gender    i miss the time you could be a tomboy as a feminine guy without being labeled trans starting a young age being talked into becoming the other gender god im glad they never tried to make me a dude for having masculine hobbies and behaviour
  as a girl whos strait even i agree these lets be tough and cut our hair short because muh feminism look ugly girls who look like guys look even worse but luckily they do it all for themselves so they wont have to give a fuck about me saying this altrough they generally need to reply how little they care a few times     sorry but i agree that long hair are feminine features look best im not even mad at korean beauty standards i rather see that than a country full of whales and other kinds of ugly people like america because of the obesety problems and such which is then fought with were just as pretty and youre a bad person if you disagree kind of reactions
  all those typos  are you esl and short hair isnt a feminism thing though and girls female who try to look like guys are usually lesbians
  uggo trannies are uggo but theyre not really bothering me as much as the ones who pass so many dudes can pass now that if i see so much as a wide jaw on an otherwise attractive cisgendered female im like ugh could be a dude and this thought kills my attraction and it wouldnt have ever crossed my mind in 2005
  im not even mad at korean beauty standards i rather see that than a country full of whales and other kinds of ugly people  both are shit and both lack variety

  nothing what a drill cant fix
  i think i should just let it die its not an office we work at a restaurant hes front of house im back of house the concert was on the 14th so no we didnt go i ended up drinking with an ex coworker instead but  is totally right if were both so fucking retarded that we cant talk about this simple ass stuff a relationship would have been absolutely doomed ill just keep my hopes up for someone do deserves my time

what are some character designs that are too ugly to be successfully cosplayed    i may be in the minority but i think bnha cosplays are fucking ugly as hell with the exception of some of the main characters hero costumes the school uniform is among the ugliest as far as school uniforms go and some of the side characters have designs that are so bad that they inspire crimes against nature as seen in pic related     thoughts
agreed bnha character designs are one of the ugliest things to grace the cosplay scene at the moment
  personally i dont think the characters design is ugly but i do think there are certain designs that just cant translate to real life and that is one of them
  everything mutant in bnha has to be flesh colored its gross
  where the fuck is this persons face
  i stopped reading bnha honestly the designs are partially to blame this cosplay looks like theres a bunch of fat dicks coming out of their size
  this     this fucker in particular looks disgusting to me
heres the problem  capeshit is ugly already 80 of the time combining that style with the battle shounen aesthetic is a travesty i really dislike that bhna is likely to be the current cosplay trend that will refuse to die the only other big trend right now seems to be voltron and while the fans are typically insufferable fujos at least the art style isnt pants on head retarded
already sick of all the bnha  its a shitty anime
  imagine touching that like a big penis grossly warm firm underneath but with movable skin overtop
  voltron is funny to me its like a reverse brony mlp situation it was absolutely wild watching the fanbase change from toycollecting nostalgic men in their late 20searly 30s to teenage yaoi shippers and watching it all in real time
bnhas inability to translate well into irl cosplay reminds me of naruto cosplay the majority of naruto cosplays i see just always look frumpy no matter what and a lot of bnha has that same frumpy awkward quality to it
  narutos outfits look like shit even in the anime     he has a really baggy jumpsuit and a hank hill ass he literally looks like bobby in pajamas only the jounin flak jackets and i guess obito and madaraa battle armor look good if the wearer is fit     but yeah bnha outfits look like dogshit only some of the villains like dabi spinner and notdeadpool look good
  he has a really baggy jumpsuit and a hank hill ass he literally looks like bobby in pajamas  im dying    speaking of bnha costumes i think midoryas hero outfit is hideous and probably worse than narutos i have yet to see anyone who didnt look like complete ass in it  the school uniforms arent that bad imo
bnha badass designs that arent straight capeshit like endeavor and mirio and can translate well to real life  inasa   snipe  shiggys smoke dude bartender guy  mandalay  kirishima  mina unironically  tokoyami if flawless  present mic    good tier  the tophat villain   aizawa sexy and easy if youre an actual thin man and not a fujo  shiggy  kendo  suneater might look stupid irl ive never seen  frog    retarded and will never work  op  iida   fleshy sadrock  all literal who mutants      this guy has a cool capeshit costume but his body is fucking disgusting
  midoriyas outfit actually would look fine if people used the proper materials instead of skin tight super thin shitty mass produced capeshit spandex that shows your tiny dick off    it should ideally be thick material kind of like the fallout ones and if someone relatively fit wears it then itll look quite fine    tldr its about as hard as finding a 90s/teen titan robin cosplayer that doesnt make you cringe
  pic related forgot masses of people legitimately pay 100 dollars for this dogshit when chinks could make you a pretty respectablefor non competing idol or kimono outfits for 100150
  speaking of shitty max produced capeshit spandex i hate the ones with the printed shines and shadows on them that everyone buys now i see it on tsuyus and zero twos everywhere it makes it look even cheaper than it actually is like some 20 shit
  oh god i can feel the staticy fleece
  i hate those suits because they make it looks really fetishy
  all might more like all meat   and agree the sexualization of young teens in it is problematic imo and its not even that good of anime to get away with it id rather stick to tiger and bunny thanks
  i love those suits because it shows off the girls asses great     terrible costumes however
  the sexualization of young teens in it is problematic imo and its not even that good of anime to get away with it    thats hypocritical lmao   tiger and bunny doesnt deserve shit fans like you t b h      ugh i hate those too it never looks good in pics or irl
  thats kind of the point depending on the character
  the sexualization of young teens in it is problematic  anon the audience for this anime is mostly teenagers
  yeah and so do normal nonprinted shines/shadow suits the shines and shadow just give the illusion that their butt looks better/bigger etc i think this could be nice to use but only a tiny bit
  mullets look good on no one
  i went through captcha hell just to forget the image
  just because they can translate well into real life doesnt mean theyre not butt fucking ugly pic related i dont know why everyone thinks these designs are good random fur frills belts pockets and whatever the fuck those boots are everything is so tacky and mismatched
anything from steven universe
  i know the author really likes mutant designs but they all look soooo bad holy hell  half of the main cast is just straight up unlikable because theyre butt ugly mutant types
  sexualization of young teens  they arent real they dont look real
  this the only exception are connie and stevonnie who look like quite a lot of young women
    i was under the impression that the whole pussycats team was ironic like in case you couldnt tell that this was way over the top we threw in an enormous dude to finish the team
  leave blue mullet twink alone  his piss yellow socks and stupid leg warmers have caused enough suffering
  one piece everything one piece outside of maybe luffys design is just a travesty
  oh man one piece designs are on a whole different level of ridiculous
  the guy is fine in an ironic way     but the cosplayer has to be a legit bodybuilder
  this dude also did a sick stain i swear ive seen another one that was an exmarine or something
    idk amethyst and rose can translate pretty well in roses case you have to do her hair very well but it can be done decently amethyst is practically made for cgl a short chunky chick with a big mouth and no self control cgl in a nutshell
  those cat outfits are so similar to other fanservice cat outfits that now i think youre hate boner is showing   inb4 triggered bnha fan  i hate the designs too
      i dont like lapiss character but her design is nice some people can also really pull off garnet
  guy
    lapis and jasper translate pretty well as well as the diamonds too
i actually like tsuyus design im posting pic related here cuz ive seen very few people pull the hair bow off i really hate most of the premade ones they just look gross and remind me of millipede skin for some reason also theyre always either the wrong shape lopsided or even both      he has an uglyass design but at least someone dared to cosplay him      yeah who would pay that much money for it i would actually like to see someone cosplay little deku in an all might onesie child or not just thought itd be cute to see      god this reminds me of the cheaply printed halloween costumes you find at places like hot topic spiderman deadpool etc      ick no just no
  all might onesie cosplay  they are everywhere  that tora being ick  you are so jealous
  garnet works well when its an actual black girl and not some white kid in a shitty afro wig desperately trying to paint themselves as brick red as possible so they dont get blackfacecusations
  if you ever actually go to a con youll realize plenty of weebs do buy the same few outfits mostly because they have the money but not the skill/time/experience to make a costume like that
  bnha is going for a noticably different thing/audience than tb  i dont like the show either but if someone is looking for action and more shouneny stuff rather than the older characters and overall more adult feeling but still fun story of tiger and bunny then its not like theyre direct alternatives to one another or put another way most of the peopel watching it are probably young teens themselves    when adults are really into it though i gotta be honest my internal reaction is why dont you just watch tiger and bunny instead its the same thing but better and for adults
  why are japanese superheroes always some type of corporation business or doing it for money type
  theyre not dumb enough to be fed the idea that you can live solely off your passions liking your work is great but doing what you love without regards for the financial aspect is unrealistic
  the sexualization of young teens in it is problematic imo  you have to be over 18 to post here young woman
  based
imo having a design that its hard to translate is more annoying than having something straight up ugly bnha designs might not be the most visually competent ones but theyre all distinctive and make sense as far as actual costumes go and the manga visuals are carried mainly by the art  su is worse cosplay wise at this point most characters have at least one person doing a good job of translating them into reality but for the most part the designs are so stylized and dependent on body characteristics and medium to look good irl i still think the designs are good though      probably just cultural difference a vigilante justice maker probably doesnt appeal as much as it does in america so with a bigger trust to the system it makes sense that heroes are either incorporated into it or giving their own
  this
come to thread expecting to see bad cosplay designs  its just a dogpile on the latest trendy anime thread  
  agreed i have literally seen two good peridots in all this time two
    that shows your tiny dick off  ive only seen 14 year old girls cosplay deku tbh all cosplayers i see look like the same pasty girl just re skinned with the occasional morbidly obese one being the only varying factor only dudes i see are half assed all mights and scuffed tokoymis
  there was that german chick who did a pretty good garnet but she got raked over the coals for blackface
  reading comprehension 0/10
  hey leave muscle cock alone
  it wasnt a good garnet though garnet is maroon not a human skin tone and she got accused of blackface because she painted herself to look like a black person at least if pic related is the one were both talking about
  that suit is atrocious awful painted skin aside
  laphos
  is it the bowl cut    could you elaborate on what makes it so bad just curious admittedly i still think ive only seen one gem that looked really good at all but i dont think its because the designs are bad
  that design looks great though you just cant be a fatass
  most young women who cosplay are built like amethyst dude
  what about bakugo
  he goes in the meh ok but not good or bad tier he translates well if youre not a fat fujo but the original design doesnt stand out
this thread is just people whining about bnha post some actual content    most clamp designs dont translate well to real life the character proportions are just too unrealistic
  bowl cut and the lame eye moon suits in general are tacky too
  how come no men ever cosplay stevonnie i get that they have a feminine build and voice but theyre apparently male enough to grow a beard
kaito kid the all white suit  hat somehow never translates well
  code geass has like the easiest designs to convert to real life though if you know what youre doing shit like tsubasa i can understand especially with some of the yuuko designs but geass isnt all that bad if people make an effort and dont just buy from china
  this is just a case of you have to be skinny to look good desu
  why are they making teenagers sexy to teenagers   youre the weird one freak
  sage mode is fucking fresh though
  i love the alternate fantasy themed outfits the artist gave them
  oh thats where those outfits come from i was wondering why people were cosplaying todoroki in that godawful blue thing
    both are full with fujos now     i got a really cute boyish face when i shave so i thought id make a good midoriya btu fuck all the greasy pride flag waving fat cunt fujos who ruined him for me like every con i see at least 10 midoriyas in different styles and versions usually theyre just combining his wig with halloween shit puting fake freckles on and caking on concealer also some are being dragged along by another fat cunt bnha fujoshi on a leash    god i hate normies
  its also the ed animation you secondary
i think bnha has some of the coolest character designs ive ever seen in a manga honestly they feel almost erratic theyre often so bizarre and outthere but theres something punk rock about it and i adore seeing such creativity from a mangaka hes up there with q hayashida and tsutomu nihei for me as far as having fresh ideas for character design    however i have never seen a good bnha cosplay in the sense that i go wow thats stunning and looks just like the character it absolutely does not translate well into cosplay because of how exaggerated most of the characters proportions are on top of their just plain weird designs    youd have to be a professional sculptor/prop maker to make a good bnha cosplay in my opinion unless youre cosplaying something like the very plain deku or maybe a character whose costume is 100 armor so you dont have to worry about your face
  hes up there with q hayashida  thats what it was reminding me of obviously they have wildly different styles but the way everyone clearly had a lot of thought put into their design puts it up there with dorohedoro one of my absolute favourite manga ever for me but this just means that their costumes are borderline impossible to look good just like you have to be fucking shredded to cosplay from dorohedoro you have to be an insane propmaker to make bnha look good
  no they look like the mangaka was trying too hard to make them edgy a lot of bnha caracter designs are lame and lackluster compared to other shounen manga and that seems to be one of the main complaints people have with bnha in general
  i would love to see a paid professional take on a character with weird proportions someone who works in a movie design studio could make it look amazing      cool story hater that must be why its in the top 5 bestselling manga at the moment
  top 5 best selling  indication of quality  hey remember fairy tail
only a third to a half of bnha designs are memorable stop being blind shounenfaggots    capeshit is gay
    go back to your lolishit pedo
  says the anon that enjoys watching 14yo anime superheros to the point that they vehemently reject any criticism with sad attempts at insults that in no way counter said criticism
  nayrt but saying capeshit is gay isnt criticism no one cares how you feel about the show take that to /a/ the point were all agreeing on is even if it looks nice on paper most of the designs are pretty shitty as cosplay
  no one cares how you feel about the show  dude you started this you cant get this fucked up with someone disagreeing about bnhas designs also capeshit was a different anon
  typical bnhafag how old are you
  if you dont like x you must like y  the other anon is right you cant tell if somethings good just based on popularity otherwise poorly written shit like naruto and twilight are good
  but theres something punk rock about it  its more like a deviantart oc than punk rock
  ive never met a tiger and bunny fan who wasnt a fujo maybe thats why the show appeals to fujos and little else
    agree bnha is really special for a shonen manga even if it falls into some trope traps i can see why its had so much success   but nah its not good for cosplay
  nihei  you wish but yeah talk about uncosplayable amazing designs these freaks always reminded me of blame but even with shoop i think the atmosphere made by the setting and anatomy/faces cant be replicated by any cosplayer or photographer
  bnha character designs feel like something a child would come up with form first then halfassed explanation of function second but even then the form looks like it was designed by a childs idea of cool i mean look at bakugo his gauntlets are literally just fucking grenades and the rest of him looks like a child given the stimulus of angry and told to go batshit in the arts and crafts cupboard    it just feels immature probably explains why my favourite designs are tsuyus and hadous
  agree
  nejire 3
  well given that the characters themselves are the inventors of their own super suits that isnt really surprising i mean look at bakugos mentality
  thats a shitty copout explanation a la she breathes through her skin considering the uniforms are created by design companies that can and have changed the heros design without their knowledge there is exactly zero reason for bakugos suit to be that awkward
    this saying the costumes look silly and like they were designed by a child they were designed by a child the students picked their own outfits dekus is my favorite solely because hes kept the design his mother gave him out of sentiment even if its considered ugly or uncool by others    bnha just gets hate because its popular its a wonderful series but this autistic arguing over it has no place on /cgl/ we are talking about costumes here anyone ever seen good bnha cosplay
  theres plenty of reason bakugo is a loud tryhard idiot and so of course he gets a loud tryhard outfit it just screams look at me look at me with all the grace of a 15 year old tantrumthrowing jerk its perfect for him
  wow you truly are blind to any criticism just gets hate because its popular
  and youre obsessed try to get back on topic
  yep and hes hot as hell look at those muscles    recently hes done a fantastic all might and all for one as well
i like spiral and i think she looks cool but a lot of her outfits are weird or ugly and the whole 6 arm thing doesnt translate well into real life
  six sword style
  the angels from evangelion are impossible to cosplay unless youre a litteral skeleton
  or a square
id love to see a well done cosplay of the stalk but that would require so much shoop thered be no point in calling it cosplay anymore  sigh
  just stop replying crybaby
  actually
  i imagine its because people dont bother getting a well made and properly fit one but rather go with cheap materials and shortcuts with a dark suit its not as obvious but a white one makes every flaw show      yikes       the designs are just fun and memorable i think thats why it works for most people a lot of them dont make much sense or translate poorly but all of them are very characteristic and fun
  jesus fucking christ why
  i could see it wok by making a big spider body like the one in this pic
heres a great shiggy only good one ive seen
  jiros the only chara who will look good irl because shes wearing jeans a tshirt and headphones basically all other designs look ridiculous irl and this is from someone who enjoys the anime   you can obviously get away with the school clothes for nonmutants but the hero outfits ugh
  sometimes i want to make an absolutely amazing midoriya suit out of mediumheavy cotton drill just to spite all the spandex wearers but id rather spend my money somewhere else since im not popular enough for the experiment to be satisfactory
  spandex would be passable if they went for a really heavy one like the stuff they made the star trek next gen jumpsuits from not that baggy pyjama shit all the chinkies use
  theyve been done pretty well  i for one also quite like the designs
  do you mean twill or am i just ignorant of a fabric i dont think twill would work
  drills a kind of tough twill the sort of thing a factory jumpsuit would be made from  i could kind of see it working honestly it is drawn as being a bit baggy on deku so it might work like that
  hm okay like a flight suit kind of jump suit yeah if you had enough room for moving i guess i could see it considering the kind of fights they all get into it has more real world thought behind it than spandex that would rip the moment you scrape across the dirt
  honestly amazing tbdesu half this thread sounds like they came from /a/
  the only one who looks fit here is the guy
  cosplayed tsu  literally did pic related for the bow  was too fucking heavy had to have my friends follow me while supporting it  ended up just taking off the bow and threw it away
    this  bowl cuts can be cute on thin asian girls overall you just need to be flat and thin for any gem the clothes arent even odd it could pass as a standard high fashion outfit combine the painted arms of bottom pic with better wigs of top 2 and its perfect
  lmao at all might being exactly the same with a cloud buster sword
  i agree on what the other anon says however i think you can make the allwhite work if you go for a hollywood translation as in tone down the cartoonyness get a shorter top hat and nonthick monocle and buy a wedding tuxedo ive not found anyone trying this on eng on jap search results
archer from fate    i have literally never seen a single good one    the aliexpress ones look terrible since theyre not skintight and he needs a really specific skin tone to make it work hes tan not black you need like some sort of former us marine who served in iraq or something or an okinawan on top of that his hair is insanely short and his proportions are wild
     i dunno man the fucking voltron fans are ridiculous threatening people who work on the show just because their gay ship wasnt canon     the characters are close friends and the same sex their are gay for each other must be canon same with with bakugo and kirishima makes my skin crawl    some bnha can translate well but very rarely i see way too many people especially midoriya and bakugo throwing whatever they can together and calling it cosplay then the ones who give them a cape which is usually a pride flag and ugh
  wow youre right i just did a quick google search and none of them look good
  other than not having a bad wig that doesnt have the roots smoothed down archer can be done if his formfitting black shirt is translated to armor or thick leather it looks cheap as a regular shirt even on fit men because of all those armoresque lines that are not contouring their personal muscles i think this guy is the closest to being satisfactory black boys can be him if they want its not like they have very many brown anime character options
  its funny you mention the armor part because i remember in one of the progress threads way back someone worked on an archer costume and someone said the exact thing you did     i personally disagree with the armor part i think a formfitting black shirt can work very well and is closer to the original idea the person you posted fits him very well face wise and skintone wise but i disagree with the shirt and the really really odd choice of velour for the fabric     i think the main issue with archer is that there are a ton of different things that need to intersect  the costume itself needs to be skintight and nearly all archer cosplays ive seen and ive pored over a ton buy or make the same tshirt that either doesnt have the right design printed or isnt tight and hangs too loose the shoulder pauldrons are frequently way too loose probably the most obvious offender and nearly always need to be tighter the wig is a bitch to style and most cosplays dont nail it and on top of that you need to be the right shade for it to look good these things arent difficult to nail nearly all of them related to costume/wig but i havent seen a single person actually have everything done and for it to look truly good     black boys can be him if they want so can anyone im just saying i havent seen a single one that nailed the distinct tanned japanese/white young male look he has
  i personally always saw it as armor but the rest of what youre saying is very true i dont think ive ever seen one in person that wasnt pretty obviously from china although this is the case with a majority of fate cosplays these days the fabric is always way too flimsy on the mantle so it doesnt hold the shape/drape properly and way too many use vinyl in places that are clearly metal plates not to mention almost all use the same crappy wig with a crappy hairline   id be thrilled to see someone do it right no matter what skintone they are just because its so rare to see
  for me it isnt really the outfits or the hairstyles that make me feel like its nearly impossible to do a proper cosplay its the fact that theyre gems and you have to add something sparkly/shiny/etc to it because otherwise itll just look plain and honestly besides from some pros the cosplays are ugly as hell its either a plain cosplay without the hnk aesthetic or a kid that glued too many gems or foil into their wigs and just put a ton of glitter unto their face youll never really be able to bring that subtle gemlike glow into your entire cosplay
  hes only posted one photo so far but i feel like kawaiibrocosplays looks pretty good with the pleather shirt the eyebrows bug me tho
  agreed this is a way better interpretation its too bad he didnt get a lace front for this i just bought several from arda on sale after debating if it was worth investing in that vs a wig thats trained back seeing this makes me glad i did shirt looks solid af
  definitely lacefronts are more expensive but the difference in looks makes it really worth it for me unless the hairline is completely covered by the style if im putting over 50 hours into a costume im not skimping on the extra 30 to get it to look like my vision
  anon why are you here no one is a bug eyed loli mutant demon etc no one can bring that stuff out properly to cosplay because it isnt real people try recreate those type of fantastical characters for fun and to show youre a fan or you like the design    what youre saying regarding hnk cosplays is that theyre cheap for not carving real gems or glass to a wig shape thats the only alternative and i dont think the nigh impossibility of that should stop people from dressing as their favorite gembutt the topic of the thread is character designs that are bad and therefore look worse in 3d and imo the gems have quite good designs themselves
i hate this design so goddamn much there are hundreds of ways to make a character sexy but this is not one of them
  too bad hes full of stds and got arrested
  most people who try to cosplay this design will end up looking like stringedup sausage jeez
  miffed gembuttfag that anon is saying that the translucent texture of their skin is impossible to recreate in real life since we have blood and flesh under our top layer not shiny rock people will always read as fleshblobs not ethereal beauties
  whats wrong with this  notice the beige parts are supposed to be skin  oh lol that looks awful    well people could still cosplay it by making a full shirt and stockings but with beige instead of cutouts it would look a lot better
autism
  wait really what happened
  hahaha what the fuck
  when its all closed up for when hes diving it looks fine but man does it look silly like that
  the pattern makes it look like she has two pairs of breasts
  they honestly just look like regular white skin in illustrations and animation you only see theyre rocks when they break and peel    going back to the wig thing would it actually be possible to print translucent huge pvc hair they could attach to each other like figure hair does by bangs and back hair being separate pieces that can be placed on someones head then pushed in together
  who is this i actually like her
  i actually like her design but im a fan of lewd shit when its overthetop because its funny and not boring ive found maybe 3 cosplays of her and theyre all incorrect mainly because they arent making the material skintight enough      fiore brunelli
  tfw the only thing women need to do to look good is be skinny   they cant even get that right
  i think even in animation when theyre not broken they dont read as flesh this is autistic but any light shining across skin will bring out the saturated redness below as an extreme example think of when you put a flashlight under your finger a rock would be one solid color all the way throughsame applies with regular lighting but much more subtly obviously just saying that aspect of the character design is literally impossible to recreate in cosplay
  3d printing something clear at this scale is going to be really difficult ive done a ton of research on creating transparent wigs and the only viable options in my opinion are worbla transpart rigid and sheet pvc like those clear tablecloths you can find in some places printing transparent pieces on an fdm printer will always leave layer lines and sla printers big enough for those pigtails all cost tens of thousands of dollars not including the resin to print with
  this isnt terrible but how the fuck do they see
  really poorly for anything directly ahead of them but better as it gets closer to the periphery
  clearly you didnt do enough research you can sculpt out the shape for the hair and vacuform it with petg
  god i hate this fucking faggot
  he got arrested at onicon for being intoxicated and walking around with an open thing of vodka
  0/10 see me after class
  i shared a gatorade mixed with vodka with him should i be concerned
    whats your beef with that guy he looks like a harmless midget but what do i know care to share your story with him anon
  lmao what happened
  well sure i was researching flexible options so thats the part i know most about but i know enough about 3d printing to say i doubt its a viable option for this specific application
  he has unprotected sex with men and women my friend went to his room party and he dipped into one person then moved on to the next with no condom she left disgusted
  sauce
    damn these inspired me to redo my archer cosplay both look pretty good
  ew how many people were there were they ugly skanks with an equal amount of diseases
  onicon
i think that most of the character designs in danganropa are amazing but some of them while looking great in 2d look terrible in cosplay i dont know what it is about them but ive never seen a really good cosplay of gundham ibuki kokochi keebo mondo ishimaru kaito fuyuhiko or sakura
  body/face type problems  gotta have the correct baby faced manletness for kokichi and fuyuhiko dont even get started on sakura    wig styling  gundham mondo kaito and probably sakura again    kibo would need some good propwork to sell the robot appearance ishimaru has big ass eyebrows that could fuck things up but other than that and normal cosplay problems im not sure what could impede a great cosplay of him
  true about needing that specific baby face for fuyuhiko and kokichi but desu ive seen babyfaced kokichis before and theres still just something weird about that design that doesnt translate well into real life with the wig and the weird outfit     agree again about the tough wig styling though  idk about ishimaru since yeah theres not a lot impeding it from being great but ive never seen anyone do him well   keebo too but that i think is in his proportions/body shape ive seen both guys and girls cosplay him and theres always something off about the body even if the armour construction is good guess that comes with the character literally being a robot
  never liked that guy either way but wtf how much of a failure can u be to get arrested at an anime con
a month and change away until the gaylord is stuffed full whos going what are you cosplaying and will you lobbycon
  whos cosplay at magfest lel i go there for the game and music     also you cant lobbycon at mag either the security check is a gaylord thing not katsucon
  you cant lobbycon at magfest anymore both the convention and the resort is enforcing a closed profile policy for the duration of the event    unless you are staying in the hotel with a key card you are not lobbyconning at all
has magfest made an official announcement about no lobbyconning yet it doesnt personally affect me but i can see that news catching many off guard especially if they dont attend katsu and arent aware of the new policy
  magfest hasnt said anything so im pretty sure it was a katsucon decision not a gaylord decision i know they said in cooperation with the gaylord but im pretty sure they still had to discuss it with the hotel also magfest has much more worth doing that requires a badge so ghosting probably isnt as big of an issue to them
  nah all my mag staffer friends already confirmed it theyre just withholding the info to fuck with the freeloading cosplayers/photographers since most of them dont buy badges
  theyre just withholding the info to fuck with the freeloading    zuh wut da fuk do they have to gain from doing this just announce it nao to push some of the freeloaders into buying their badge sooner
  most of the magfest staff and attendees dont care for the cosplayers and gwc
  the ones who dont pay clog up the gazebo area on saturday because it isnt as crowded as katsu now that katsu banned lobbyconners itll just be worse this year unless they act on it like katsu did i dont blame them for hating those people at all
big excite for magfest 4th year now wasnt originally intending to go but a friend popped up and had a gaylord room available and im cleared for the time off from work eastward bound    and if anybody is looking for a con discord with a channel specifically for magfest come all gulls    
i heard there were plans for a touhou meetup any details about that
  i second this going to be bringing my momiji 
first year being in charge of a room at the gaylord so happy got one last year we roomed across the river and it was so annoying    what are everyones cosplans i always cosplay at mag super easy to meet people
  emil   based
  what are everyones cosplans  going as a cleaner perfect cosplay for that cold ass weather in the harbor
  be ready for the cosplay police at mag to rape your butthole for having gun props you probably will be asked to put them back in your room so bring them at your own peril
      is there a facebook event if not can someone make one
  lotus and emil    lets be friends anon
old thread     /cgl/ idol spreadsheet      /cgl/ resources spreadsheet rip lol      recently  pheris single pheri dust was released  melancholiaahs mv for dead decade was released her debut single pale is coming out on december 5th  stellure performed embers of a phoenix at animenyc    so anyway lets talk audio platforms for both originals and covers theres a lot of options for where you can release your songs whats your favorite what are the pros and cons for some of the major platforms and how they relate to our weird little hobby what do you wish idols would use more to upload their music    featured group various groups and performers starlight idol festival
throwback question who were your favorite netidols 20102015 era
  pinku project hands down not even oishii project was near their level
for audio platforms i think it depends on what specifically theyre doing  covers  pretty much only soundcloud the only platform you cant monetize and while covers may still be taken down it doesnt really matter bandcamp is also an option but legality is a biiiig issue there since you technically cant sell covers even putting it for free doesnt excuse you from it    original  i prefer spotify or apple music i love streaming and rarely buy something unless i plan on covering it myself at least steaming still more or less hands revenue to the artist    releasing  i do wish more people would take the time to release in places like spotify apple music google music etc while i dont mind bandcamp i just dont care much for it however it does mesh well when it comes to extras photos videos etc which i really like     unrelated but i do wish more groups would take the time to copyright their works i know the whole once you create it its yours applies but if anyone wanted to take the music lyrics etc and copyright them first the group would be fucked
  correct me if im wrong but isnt copyrighting expensive or is that securing a trademark or am i just really uninformed
  seconding pinku project the way they carried themselves even at events was inspiring
  it can get pretty pricey personally i dont blame an artist for not doing so especially the young ones or the ones just starting out
  copyrighting a piece of music is only about 5060 and it takes a few months unless you expedite it in which it can get pricy like  cant blame young people or those just starting out for not copyrighting and like i said its not necessary once its created just extra protection but i say it more towards the groups that want to be legit especially if youre already spending money for someone to make the music or spending money on costume materials id say take that extra step cause you never know but this is all just personal preference
  i agree on pinku project one of the very few who actually got what idol means lmao
    i dont really recall a lot of netidols in the early years but pinku project definitely was a favorite haha
  i still stan berry what a queen
what do you think of idols performing in cosplay
  generally i think if the cosplay has something to do with the song theyre performing its okay its just weird to see people do a crossover like that if they have nothing to do with each other but if they feel comfortable wearing the cosplay it shouldnt be a big of a deal
      i agree that if they are performing a song from what theyre cosplaying its cute or if it just fits the character really well     but otherwise its seems weird to me in general i cant get invested in netidols who only cosplay i wanna see them as themselves much more     which is why the idolfest at holiday matsuri still makes me so bitter i cant believe you have to cosplay for that makes me way less interested in going
  ah alright that makes perfect sense
hamako idols just posted about one of their past members who turned out to be a molester im now extra concerned about their two other male members as there are little to none decent men who cosplay/dance from love live without having some kind of ulterior motives
  cringe
  didnt an anon in a previous thread make accusations about hamako idols male members and someone was defending them i bet their defender looks like a complete ass now
  she looked like an ass before this came out lol
  lmao where you at with your bullshit claudie
  thats pretty sad that someone felt the need to defend them and now look at whats happened i bet they feel pretty stupid now
  where im at is its heinous that a predator was in their group so im glad theyre being vocal about his being abusive so others are warned and that doesnt automatically mean the other two are up to the same bullshit how i feel is still the same as i felt prior to this coming out that people do horrible shitty things and while we can be attentive and cautious we can also understand that not every single individual fitting a stereotype is a predator
  also the poster directly states that james and graham the two individuals people were concerned about in the last thread have been like family through this lastest ordeal does anyone know why or have an argument as to why the poster would use that language to protect them while already calling out a member for sexual assault if they were also predatory
    and yet ruby and dia are the creeps right thinking emoji
          so are yall done or are you finished so we can get back to actually talking about idols
  sorry you got called out but theres no reason to sweep a pedo under the rug none was probably going to bring it up again until you did    dont be a sakura hana
  sorry you have nothing better to do than falsely accuse people of being pedos when they their group and their peers have all addressed in public the fact that james and graham are harmless maybe you can actually contribute something now instead of mindlessly gossiping
super rare says theyve sent out emails already i hope you all got good news
  sorry you got called out   or maybe its actually better to drop it because it turns out she was right if what hamako is saying is valid
  your making this worse for yourself considering none brought up james and graham until you did the whole group has been traumatized enough with one member sexually harassing them but acting as if were petty for talking about it is making you look worse    ive seen you trip get involved with petty drama on here yet you wanna act like the innocent good girl now its ok to own up and recognize your wrong
  no one brought up james and graham until you did   read the thread   the whole group has been traumatized enough with one member sexually harassing them but acting as if were petty for talking about it is making you look worse  so lets unpack this your assumption is that im calling it petty to discuss whether these two are predatory or not not only am i not calling it petty i explicitly stated in this  post that it is important that theyre being vocal so that others are warned its important to be forthcoming about sexual assault in this community so that as i previously stated we can be attentive and cautious about who to avoid youre right that this group has been traumatized but what is going to further traumatize them is spreading rumors and false accusations about two members who have been according to hamakos instagram have also been victims of phils predatory behavior by trying to paint these two members are predatory when they themselves have been victimized youre forcing the group as a whole to while attempting to heal from the trauma of being sexually abused go through additional trauma of defending themselves/their friends on social media you can discuss phil being predatory which is important and valid without needlessly slandering other members in the process     if you want to discuss more about how the witchhunt youre engaging in perpetuates the trauma that the group has been through you can read the thread and then own up that maybe you dont have as thorough an understanding of sexual assault the situation with hamako trauma or me for that matter as you thought you did
    i got my interest in jpop thanks to odottemita idols performing in cosplay but what do you mean by idols performing in cosplay    are you talking about something like this where it is the idol cosplaying as another character and covering a different song        or this where it is just the outfit in general     
who has the worst logos in your opinion when it comes to idols or dance groups
  danzoo dash had a really ugly logo for a while glad that they changed it
  watching grahams instagram stories about this and listening to him constantly threatening people with physical violence im ready to break fingers over this i wanted to kick him out of the car on the freeway isnt really making me feel bad for him in this situation
poster of  here to hamako idols    chill we arent accusing your male members of anything were just skeptical because of what i mentioned in this post trusting any male in this community can bite you in the ass as most of the kind trustworthy men turn out to be harassers/stalkers/pedophiles/etc    there arent many idol groups with male members so if you want this thing to become less of a stigma do something about it try to bring it to the general public that not all men in the idol community are bad thanks

ala is getting pretty big nowadays isnt it should i just bring the usual 10 pc per charm design for stock or go a little higher
  i hope you have over 100 designs because 10 charms per design is weak as fuck anon  you sure youre in the right place
  relax
  dif anon but i want to jump im on charm discussion i do well with cons and my online store im not sure why but acrylic charms are always one of my weaker sellers
  thats unusual what are your strong sellers for me its stickers online and charms at cons i barely sell any prints these days
  speaking of charm selling who are some of the biggest charm sellers i want to pick one or a few to make my goal/competition with and so far im not finding very many big sellers hitsuya seems kinda big on the market but thats all i can think of now as far as names
  hitsuya  who
  hitsukuya on twitter
youmacons over howd everyone do ive heard pretty mixed results from friends and the fb group a lot of people complaining they barely made cost
  thats really close minded thought and not productive towards your growth
  how is it not productive toward their growth some people are inspired to make art and sales others are aggressively ambitious to make art and sales  sakimichan is a more aggressive type for example   one size doesnt fit all anon and dont try to foist your ideals onto someone else so condescendingly
  not productive towards your growth  setting goals for yourself isnt productive towards growth wut
  anon wants to pick someone to compete with in sales as their goal  idgi how would that even work you wont have access to their sales figures/order quantities or even the info to make a guess in the right ballpark maybe you mean in terms of how many designs they have available but it doesnt sound like it
so how was nekocon for those of you that went i wanted to do it and decided against thinking about next year and is pro row worth the added cost
  attempting edick swinging in /aag/  what are you even doing lmao
  i did pretty decently i flew in from out of state and made about 6 times my cost  so ill probably be back next year this is my first year going so i cant speak for how this year was compared to others but i will say friday was incredibly slow sunday was on part with saturday sales though honestly it was busier than saturday considering that the hall was open much shorter on sunday
does anyone want to buy my table from me at holmat
  i dont know if they count but kayozia seems to be rising a wee bit the only issue i have with her charms is that every charm she makes suffers from sameface syndrome im not even joking because when i first discovered her store i thought she legit was copying and pasting all the eyes shes drawn onto different anime and video game characters from laziness    her art is cute and obviously highquality but i cant unsee the skinny necks on each chibi she draws and the sameface syndrome it actually inspires me to make sure each character i draw has their own unique eye shape and not the same thing    pic attached is her nekopara charms
  is that artist the one anon who kept getting hugely flawed shipments of charms recently i felt really bad for them  it is cute does look a bit same in the face and expression otoh i actually like the necks it sets them apart from a generic chibi style
  i did well also liked how it was run   about pro row besides a bigger table the benefit is the placement means people are likely to see your work first/when they walk in but the whole alley is of a size that theyll probably do a circuit of the whole thing anyway its a great size for the con in an age where the trend is to oversell more and more tables proportionate to the attendance
  it was ok but i was down 30 from last year i think the pro row is only worth it if you need the space
what program do people draw digitally with these days is it still photoshop  i personally use paint tool sai but it doesnt really let you have transparent bgs like pic related
  ive ditched photoshop in favor if clip studio paint i just find the tools more practical and easier for my drawing process and at this point ive hoarded and tweaked so many custom brushes going to back to ps to experiment feels like a chore i still use ps for touch ups and tweaking but even kind of use is further between for each time since csp can handle most of my needs    i used to use sai a long time ago too if you prefer sai to photoshop too i would give clip studio paint a try it is similar but better than sai in pretty much every conceivable way
  you can get a transparent background in sai though make a background layer turn it invisible and when you save as png check the 32bpp argb option not sure if it works on anything other than png though
mfw i used the wrong image  rip      thank you so much for the tip anon ive been looking for other programs to try so ill give it a shot      oh  thank you anon   i didnt think it was possible on sai for some reason
  illustrator because i like to make my life difficult
  pretty bad i came in from out of state and im in the red     i have 2 aa friends who also came in from out of state who are also in the red we are all print artists with a few pins and charms here and there we were also placed in the back of the room i dont know if that has something to do with it the girl next to me though did incredibly well from what i could tell but she had lots of prints surrounding her on every side and was a rather good artist she may even be    because i heard her say she flew in several times     it would be good if you were local but the hotel and food cost killed me since i was paying for my helper too
    diff anon but charms hardly sell for me either nothing can beat prints for me
  i did pretty well a fair couple grand i drove in from out of state and i beat what i made at a larger con earlier in the year i think it was definitely not a print con though i didnt really get steady print sales until sunday and many of my neighbors that were mainly print artists seemed to be really slow all weekend i was never more thankful to have expanded my product offerings
  i think its genuinely just a case of what type of products your art is suitable for what looks good as stickers charms etc might not be that interesting as a print and vice versa obviously there are artists who can do well in both but i think your average artist will probably have a preference for one style and that will be reflected on their products not a bad thing at all though i think its nice when artists know their own strenghts and offer products based on that instead of focusing whatever just happens to be the newest trend
  looking at their etsy store it seems like theyre doing it intentionally ive seen some artists kinda make their charms in very very similar style to each other to kinda force a brand type of feeling to it i dont know any artists off the top of my head but its kinda what funko does with the intentional sameface style  i guess it depends on what their regular nonchibi/charm art looks like
   closest example i could find was like noflutter you instantly see their art and know its by noflutter i guess its just a design preference
  a fair couple grand  i just brought home 450ish   here my other 2 friends brought in even less this was my second con an being my first where i brought home 700 just broke even for my first time i was even in the way back in the dead row at animenext too so i was pretty annoyed i was put in the back at neko as well     i heard such good things about nekocon so i was confident id break even and bring in profit too i feel terrible and feel the same about my artwork
  i think audience has a lot to do with it too though my audience loves prints and stickers but theyre definitely not the kind that would pick up many if any charms versus other fandoms that hoard as many keychains as they can when im doing a con the charms that i do sell are definitely not to my typical demographic of customers
  actually it was my 3rd first one i just forget about because it was a first year 2day high school con called fanfaire    i just got an email from them though that says theyre raising table price to 150 but im locked in to a special 60 price that was the 2018 cost    this is funny because no one showed up to that convention and they really want 150 for their 2 day shit show now some people didnt even make 20 i was one of the lucky few to make table back at 61    it was so dead artists were playing their 3ds behind the table or sleeping the only people buying from one another were the artists    would it be in bad taste to email them back and tell them how ridiculous this is
  i would email them that sounds atrocious
  i do please email me anon
  i switched over to sai primarily but use photoshop for color touchup and text
    you and the other anon dont necessarily have bad or unmarketable art were in the middle of an aa bubble where many many people are selling and those who are relatively new and usually have a smaller product range vs the zillion charm and enamel pin catalog some people have amassed are susceptible to not do well through no flaw of their work
  seconding clip studio aka manga studio its a nice program especially relative to its cost and the more i learn to do with it the better and better it gets
    youre probably right but the thing that gets me is that a lot of anime/video game characters do have specific eye shapes i know anime is all samey from afar but some characters do have different eye shapes that distinguishes them from each other it just confused me because every charm in kayozias store has sameface issues and i used to do sameface art as a teen and i stopped once i realized my issue    i didnt know people out there do it for their brand possibly like sakimichan but it just makes the artists work feel stale to me kayo has cute art and its high quality but i feel they can do so much more and better as opposed to doing the same eyes for everything with just small alterations
  if you get clip paint wait till they have the sale it happens every so often
  pretty sure im not who youre talking about anon i was talking about my youmacon profits since i was at youma and not nekocon
  emailed you
  i dont know where you heard good things because most people did meh last year i did 3k last year so i came back but i only did 2300 this year
     im going to disagree it may very well be their art we are in the middle of an aa bubble but that just means you have more competition if half of an aa is earning thousands and youre lucky to make back cost thats a pretty clear divide you have to find a way to make yourself either a good enough or b different enough to make sales or both     im very new to cons myself so its not a seasoned veteran thing its a business sense and skill level thing if anything im not trying to be mean more so just encouraging people to be realistic about what is obtainable for them at their current level
  i mean it is linked to business sense and marketing ex what type of product you brought but that doesnt  art skill the anon who did really well even said they thought product was important and it wasnt a print con
  if half of an aa is earning thousands and youre lucky to make back cost thats a pretty clear divide    i always read about how to not expect to make thousands your first few cons how many cons should you do before you start to see profit    i thought i was ok with making costs back at my first con but now im questioning due to losing money at my second
  maybe see what booths are doing well as much as you canlike if they get lots of traffic and seem busy and see what they do that you can do similarly     this is my first year or so doing cons but i spent over a year preparing for my first con with my goal being no one would say yeah i can tell its your first year though im a person that over analyses everything i put a lot of effort and upfront cost into making my booth as good if not better than veterans booths i see online scope out aani and make note of what everyone else is doing it sucks to compare yourself to others but theyre your competition you need to ask yourself out of everyone in the aa why will they choose me to give their money to what are you offering that makes you desirable every booth has a bnha print why should they pick yours    if its your first year i wouldnt worry as much as if you had been doing aa a while most businesses make a loss their first year just observe others and start building yourself a solid foundation       i still agree with you but thats where my a and b example comes into play if your art isnt god tier you have to play smart diversify find a niche etc in the current state of aa you better be fucking fantastic if you think you can get away with the same wall of fanart prints and handful of kawaii acrylic charms everyone else has
  its hard to get a trend from just two cons anon i think youre doing fine so long as the next couple cons you have positive progress
  being a cunt and comparing yourself with others so you can beat them like theyre your rivals or something is pretty stupid and immature but if you want to keep living your high school anime delusions go for it ig
  i dont see how anon is being a cunt by making rivals its not like they are trying to sabotage other artists theyre just setting those artists as goals to ameliorate towards some people do best when they have a clear objective to strive towards its not too different than targeting an old master and studying their style to steal techniques as some put it
  heres my experience for reference   first con made like 20 profit after costs   second con made 400 profit    after that i regularly hit 1k and i saw steady progress throughout the years i remember hitting 46k with just prints and a handful of charms and nothing else several years and a ton of new merch types later now i can comfortably hit 10k at big cons     but to be fair i didnt start off doing cons with the mindset that i was going into it as a fulltime business for the first year or two i did like 23 cons tops per year and i did it as a way to make cash on the side not as my bread and butter it was only about 2 years ago that i made the transition into full time tabling i definitely wouldnt recommend it to anyone now the market is volatile and while ive been doing well i have a huge stock in terms of merch and fandom variation and a small group of devoted return customers/fans i have friends whove really been struggling recently when i know they used to make 23k comfortably at cons in previous years     i actually dont really understand why so many newbies nowadays sign up for multiple cons ahead of time when they have 0 con experience in their belt like i see people on aani talk about signing up for 6 cons a year when they havent even tabled at a single one yet i would suggest to take it easy and do a couple at a time without the expectation that this is going to turn into a dayjob for you putting less pressure on your ability to have a successful con will help you make better art honestly
  im 99 sure thats not how you use the word ameliorate its more like fix resolve ex ameliorate a dangerous situation /offtopic
  same first two cons barely made back cost then a low three digits profit then up its very much a thing to learn what youre doing right and wrong and become much better after a little experience
how long do you think the kda hyoe is gonna last for was thinking of making a print for it but im slow as molasses and probably wont have it done till february or so have to finish up current pipeline
  oof i cant imagine the hype sticking around for more than 2 months or so
  i dont see how anon is being a cunt by making rivals  rivalry has to go both ways or else its just weird and gross imagine being the person on the other end and once in awhile you notice this rando shadowing you either trying to match your output or doing the same fandoms whatever and even if you dont notice its still creepy as fuck youre just doing you and meanwhile anon is analyzing your every casual move and using it to boost themselves above you how can you not see how shitty that is other people dont exist just to provide benchmarks for anons art career
  have fun never becoming successful artists do this to eachother more often than not how do you think anyone gets to the top you have to constantly compare yourself to everyone else this is why juried cons exist
  if you hate all your rivals and competition then you have issues      ive had several people be inspired by me i think its cute i dont understand how you think that is creepy it sounds like you are taking competition waaaaaaaaaaay too seriously
  this you gotta remember a lot of people hyped about it dont play league at all so theres no sticking power here
  did about 49k profit flying in from out of state about the same as last year
  im with you i dont really even get what anon is trying to do in picking one specific successful artist to hurl themselves towards imitating as closely as possible instead of doing the logical thing we all do and learning from successful people in general
      theres a difference between healthy competition/following trends and picking one artist specifically and copying their entire business model though
  where are you getting copying their entire business model from you literally just conjured those words up from nothing
  picking one artist specifically and copying their entire business model  who said anything about doing that you are taking what others have said and just taking it to the extreme
       is literally talking about the behavior stalking one particular artist  thats where i got entire business model from i disagreed with the replies assertion that behavior is just competition
    the original poster said they were going to pick specific charm sellers to make them into their goal/competition and mentioned one person in particular  thats creepy      the logical thing we all do and learning from successful people in general  this is correct
  the original poster said they were going to pick specific charm sellers  yes sellers with an s at the end not picking one artist  literally 99 of businesses compare themselves to other businesses and look into how much they make how they are trending how much they sell stuff for etc  what other point of reference do you use to determine how well you are doing and how well you should be doing
  they literally mentioned a specific person    the point of reference i use is whether im profitable
  they literally mentioned a specific person  as an example of one of the people she likes    the point of reference i use is whether im profitable    some of us do this as a real business not as a hobby if you feel that its creepy that someone might look up to you and be inspired then the creative field is not for you
everyone relax    how well do magnets and shirts sell
an artist i follow just posted a screenshot of them purchasing ax aa 2019 tickets 2 days ago ummmmmm wtf did i miss
  the fuck im on the waitlist email list do they just approach people one by one
  do you mean extra badges or do you mean tables because extra badges were to go up for sale on the 5th
  the artist said one or a few and didnt say that person was just an example but keep reading your own interpretation of it i guess        that someone might look up to you and be inspired  i think you know thats different from the behavior described being inspired/influenced by successful artists is fine but the behavior of looking at others as if they are a goal post is gross and dehumanizing     i dont even really understand what op could learn from targeting charm sellers specifically seeing what sells well you can find that by searching for general top sellers keeping up with the market and trends following many different artists not choosing a specific one or few how to design good charms you shouldnt be learning that from specific artists but looking at a broad sampling of charms so youre not just ripping people off how many designs to make and stock that can vary even if you do the exact same quality of art and the exact same properties you just need to learn that from experience its such a weird thing to pick such a small sample group for
  oh that makes sense they bought 2 tickets i think so maybe extra badges i know they didnt actually get in through signups but had people offering to share with them though not sure if that would make sense if max 2 people are allowed to be behind a table at a time    also desu theyre so popular idk whod wanna fuck themselves over by sharing with them lol
  your last paragraph was exactly my reaction upon reading anons post im going to pick one or three charm makers to model myself after and try to be similar to this just makes zero sense as s goal to set and is bizarre lol
so a few threads ago the conversation topic of etsy and how successful some anons were on here motivated me to put some more time and effort into my store ive went from having 12 sales per month to about 1012 per day for the last 2 weeks i love seeing it when people post their successes here because it pushes me to work harder on my marketing/business side of aa thanks anons
  congratulations keep up the hard work anon are you an american etsy is great for black friday and the holidays i hope its a good season for all your hard work
  im in the us thanks for the tip im looking forward to this holiday season and ill most likely participate in bf sales then i wasnt quite sure how bf was for artists i saw a thread on aani mentioning how many dont participate in bf/cm much lets hope we can all make it rain 
  mind me asking what that entails like putting more products up offering discounts etc my sales have really dropped off since ive been busy with life stuff so hoping to get the ball rolling again
  i reworked my seo changed my pricing structure offering discounts for multiple purchases reorganized the categories in my store for easier browsing and added a lot more clear higher quality photos of my inventory ive also been posting daily on my social media now so i think thats been helping a lot
whats the best way to approach you guys at cons if i want to commission lewds just walk up and ask hey do you draw lewds
  worded nicely but dont skirt around it i guess hey would you be willing to draw nsfw/lewds if not i understand    none of my aa work is really saucy but ive had people ask when commissioning and im like yeah sure why not i think some other artists may seem more uncomfortable about it though so just be prepared for that and them maybe thinking youre weird
  just walk up and ask hey do you draw lewds  yes but just be ready for the occasional artist who thinks lewds are of the devil or whatever
  just ask do you do lewds is a reasonable question to be asked in a mostly anime industry artist position were not fucking children here
      alright just act cool about it thanks guys
  id say target tables that already have nsfw art for sale a lot of the time they tend to be kind of hidden away in a folder with a warning so theyre not that easy to spot but theyre there a polite do you take commissions and calling it nsfw sounds way nicer than lewds or porn or whatever else also make sure to mention if youre looking for an atcon commission or not i cant imagine a lot of people would be interesting in drawing nsfw at the con though
  technically some artists tabling are still minors but yeah asking and framing it as if not thats fine is a good way to go about it
  were not fucking children here  i sure hope we arent anon
i have no problem with people doing it but its kinda surreal to randomly see someone use your art original/not commissions to them as their avatar
  do they follow you at least its 100x more surreal when they dont even follow you or seem to know who you are lol i hate people
  if the artist looks like they do they probably do its probably good to approach artists that already do fanservice
  i draw smut and if someone walked up and used the word lewds i would say no because that word is for teenage boys and is also incredibly non descriptive just ask if theyre willing to accept a not safe for work commission and if they seem fine with it ask what their limitations are keep in mind that not everyones view of what is adult content is the same one artist might think a fully clothed sexy pose is lewd a different artist might draw explicit pornography one tactic you could take is to boil down your request into the most vanilla version that youll find acceptable and then tell them they can take it farther if they want many artists might be uncomfortable with your question so using the term lewd or jumping right into a description of what you want might not go over well    also yeah artists tend to sell the kind of art they prefer to make so if they dont have any sexy art up then maybe dont ask them
    i made a thank you post for followers once and someone used that art as their icon they dont even follow me but they did like that single post if they would just message me i would give them the image without the huge t h a n k y o u i scribbled on looking at their icon sends direct pain into my soul
so i did all 31 pieces for inktober this year     ive thought about compiling them all in small booklets or zines to sell at conventions but all the zine making services look to be pretty pricey to just make one something like picrelated    anyone know of any affordable zine printing services
  printninja does zines for cheap but you have to order at least 250 copies which could cost around 900
  just print it yourself and buy a stapler
  but what if they want to sell multiple copies if they want to make 1020 books then thats gonna be a lot of paper and ink
  if youre only doing some 1020 booklets in black and white i would check what the local printers offers
   thats still going to be cheaper anon
  kiki dickbutt  i think i was here for this thread and still somehow missed that good god thats hilarious
make pin  super proud of it  very well made  20 followers i have buy it instatnly   awesome  now cant get new followers  start posting lots of art of things from fandom to get attention  no followers   befriend others in the fandom   a few likes     ugh im going to have to start drawing porn arnt i    i know that twitter/tumblr has like 1m uploads of art and gifs and whatever every three seconds but damn if youre a newbie into a fandom youre never going to push your product i know for a fact if i sold at cons like in person i would sell out cause i have a nitch fandom that i am catering to millions of fans but no cute merch or fan artists really but fuck me im trying to get recognized this day and age on twitter
  you realize it takes time right
  do you have twitter friends like do you actively try to befriend other artists on twitter without expecting anything or are you just treating twitter as like professional art only i never engage with anyone and i still expect them to rt my stuff     like anon how do you think people rt things on twitter people kind of have to be following you first to see and rt tagging isnt super great on there so if you have only like 20 followers your reach is going to be super small i made friends organically by complimenting other people on their art and sharing common interests and once i had artist mutuals it was much much easier to get engagements and new followers on my art posts since it increased my reach
alright whos the idiot with the display that injured someone i need to know
  wrong image
is this the artist  
  how the heck does someone get sent to the emergency room from a wire grid display falling was it filled with knives or something
  it said in the replies there was a plastic sign on top the grids that also fell and cut the person across the forehead said person had to go to the er to get stitches
  its dangerous to post that without proof
  nayrt but i can see how anon found out though if you search the handle of the artist this happened to on aani you can find her posting about the incident in aug at matsuricon if you go to the matsuricon website the aa map is still up so it narrows it down to one of two people keikiiart and bellibuttons and the keikiiart person does have a photo matching the description of the display grid cubes sign overhead
there was some discussion about drawing tablets last thread but i wanted to ask specifically whats the best noncintiq standing monitor tablet that people have used im feeling ready to upgrade but would like to try and stay around 500 if possible or at least below 1000    a friend of mine has an ugee and said it worked fine but ive seen huion mentioned too
  i was thinking about that too i still dont know if i should get an ipad  pen or cintiq    also please dont get a huion anon they really suck
  da but im curious whats wrong with huion i got one of their basic nobutton ones 6 years ago and its still working alright with no critical issues it does lack some wacomonly features but i can at least draw  has their quality degraded since then or theres something wrong with the more expensive tiers
  curious too i have a big screen tablet of theirs and its worked like a charm i actually prefer it over my cintiq and it was a fraction of the price
  going to the er for something so small really lmao seems like someone baaawwwwing for money
  youre an idiot lmao  you cant assume injuries especially head injuries are minor just by looking at them because you have no idea what preexisting conditions the person may have or how much internal damage was done they wouldve been stupid not to go to the er
  if it required stitches im guessing the cut was pretty deep
  are you really this retarded ive had a gash on my right inner arm about that same size and it required stitches you can literally see the fat layer underneath skin bulging out when a cut goes deep enough even as small as half inch and even on thin skin areas
this is most likely a aa vent but when i was tabling at an art con a bunch of randos went around asking for free sketches in their journals literally every other artist had drawn in the book and i had to tell them no twice cause i was tabling and im not giving out free art    how do you feel about this and how anons dealt with this
  you either have to be keikiiart or a troll because i have trouble fathoming how anyone could be this dumb
  not that anon but ive had far worse cuts and not gone to the er maybe thats what they are scoffing
  seems like someone baaawwwwing for money  i agree i cant see how a plastic sign can cause enough damage to send someone to the er unless their skin is made out of tissue paper      people ask for free stuff at about every con i go to i just say no and forget about it
  that just puts you firmly in the idiot corner too anon  there are many valid reasons not to seek medical care for an injury like lack of insurance lack of access to quality care etc but just thinking oh its not that big of a deal isnt one of them and thats an extremely dangerous mentality
  lol maybe secure your display next time
  hm i like it not exactly fond of random congoers asking but i like the idea of sketchbooks containing sketches from various artists attending the con its very common for artists to trade sketchbooks at comiket and i wished it was a more common practice at north american cons     how anons dealt with this  honestly i would just scribble something regardless of who asked it only takes a few minutes i can draw whatever i want and it fosters goodwill
  sorry to be that guy but which model screen huion do you have ive heard increasingly good things about nonwacom screen tablets over the years but never to the point someone says they prefer it to a cintiq
ive been going to this one con every year since 2014 and just made less money this year than i did my very first year  they moved the tables this year and it was in a much larger area with a huge amount of space between each row technically that seems great since it means way more room for people to walk through the area but it made me realize that the area people walk through is probably purposely made small as to force people to slow down and look at everyones booth idk im just trying to figure out why i made 1/3 less money this year than last /
  usually less cramped spaces make it easier for people to browse since theyre not forced out by the flow of the crowd your decline in sales could be attributed to many reasons though honestly you can probably narrow down the reasons by comparing your gross profits to the other artists who tabled like are you updating your stock did you pick the right seasonal fandoms is the area the con is in going through a recession were the table placements shitty this year etc etc
wheres the anime boston artist alley application page the website just redirects back to the page before it
  i thought abs reg opened on the 17th delayed due to personal emergency or whatever
  i could see one of those thick acrylic sandwich signs doing it they are usually pretty heavy and have sharp edges kinda looks like whats sitting on the top of that display in the pic
    while it looks small in the picture thats really no indication of whether it needed stitches or not with how much head inuries bleed and how a facial injury may be prone to reopening its normal and once it needed treatment then we all know the healthcare system can charge  insane prices
  draw dickbutt  or like whatever else you can default to drawing in thirty seconds i understand being annoyed but also they probably werent expecting anything like what youd do for a commission more the sort of little doodle people put next to signatures etc
  i have a huion kamvas gt191 a lot of the reasons id prefer it over the cintiq are personal preference such as i enjoy the surface texture of the huion and love that the entire tablet is a screen without those buttons on the side the cintiq im comparing it to is the 22hd by the way i feel like the huion is sleeker and less bulky and i like the placement of the plugs with the way my desk is set up also i love the huion stand the cintiq stand was really weird and uncomfortable to me it was kind of just far enough off the desk to be inconvenient my arms would always be in an uncomfortable position when trying to draw on it huions basically touches the desk and matches me perfectly as far as pressure response and pen accuracy i have noticed no difference between the two    there are downsides to the huion though they didnt matter to me but they could to other people if you dont like the sleek texture of the screen there is no other option because the texture sheet that comes with it gives an oily effect to the screen the tablet pen must be charged as well this hasnt been an issue for me though since it comes with two pens so just have one plugged in and swap them out it could pose an issue though if you break one also if you are a gamer and plan to use the huion as a second screen sometimes the touch software will make a click not register it happens maybe once a day for me and its only been an issue once when i was playing a moba you can prevent this by closing the touch software when you are planning to game and whenever youre done just open it again from the start menu    the huion gt191 195 inches is 500 and the cintiq 22hd is 17k pulled from amazons prices  do a lot of research on your own if you want to get huion but my personal experience and the experience of my friends who have also picked up a huion have been great im honestly really glad that there is a serious competitor to wacom now
  this is actually a very common practice at comic cons i can see why anime cononly artists might be confused about it though i do them whenever people ask but i never spend more than like a minute or two on it and i never take requests so they get whatever i decide to draw      ive bled/broken skin from just running into the blunted corner of my wooden bed frame i imagine a plastic sign holder with a sharp corner falling 4ft and hitting you in the head will definitely draw blood have you ever picked up one of those signs anon theyre actually pretty hefty and while normally you wont be able to cut anyone with it like you would with a knife the force of it falling so far down would definitely do it       everyone else already mentioned that head injuries are serious so i wont reiterate that but like have you considered the fact that the con staff might have told them to the er the con they were at seems pretty small i dont know how equipped their first aid station was to handle a bleeding wound that apparently needed stitches i know if i was staffing that con i would have suggested the artist go to the er too
  nayrt but this is what i have the most problems with on twitter if i comment to try to engage theyll just like and not reply if i try to engage with a comment i have been told to fuck off im not going to reveal how i did xyz  the like and no reply is what i get too often i usually take it as a sign of whatever ok but most dont respond at all  maybe its just the artists i try to interact with they range from 30 followers to 3k rarely 30k but i can understand those people get flooded and will likely not reply
  what the heck are you commenting with that gets you that kind of reply
  i really like how you did x its beautiful did you do the glowing hair strands by y anyway i love your style  just basic shit like that and its true i loved her style and i even bought some of her stuff before  i didnt include the actual text because i dont want to get outed here
  i get people not responding to comments because i avoid it too out of discomfort w/ strangers not anything their fault but responding like that is fuckin crazy i think a lot of artists get such an overinflated sense of importance mixed with stress that they end up acting weirdly intense and cunty like relax its just pictures
  yes i try never to ask other artists how they do a technique because some go really crazy about it pic related ill try to be more careful with how i ask ask casual questions though i try to be as inoffensive as possible
  i dont get people who act like that not sharing your techniques is absolutely completely fine but why not just respond with im too lazy/dont have time to make a tutorial because its too much effort sorry or something there are better ways to avoid answering questions than acting like a pretentious cunt about it
  what a pretentious twat
  ive only attended very small cons before which is why i asked yes
  i love my huion way more than i ever loved my cintiq never ever going back to wacom
  meanwhile ive been thinking about making a tutorial on how i make my crafts/props just to show people how hard it is to make which i think would make people more willing to pay a higher price for what i sell   ive also thought about selling tutorials which is what that person could do i dont understand pretentious response
  its from bara chan who has thousands of followers and could easily sell some classes on udemy or whatever instead of just making gaia online art even sarah anderson makes online classes for webcomics and sells tons of her class packages for simple black and white digital strips  now i dont think anyone should be forced to give out the name of their manu or how they do a technique but she could have just ignored the question or declined   its hard for me to separate artist from art so i unfollowed her after
  to be fair that was really badly asked your work is generic and interchangable with other artists crap from tumblr but i guess youll do teach me without me saying please
  i mean i sure wouldnt have bothered telling them either especially with that kind of attitude but there are better ways of declining than acting like a pompous prick
    for sure the artist was being a dick here but they possibly got this question frequently and this was just the point they snapped a lot of people treat artists like sources that can be mined for techniques and they arent really subtle about it so i kind of get it saying sorry no politely over and over to people who are just trying to use you as a resource can get exhausting   but maybe im projecting some personal feelings onto the situation
    lol yeah it was absolutely because asker was a jackass about it literally the next post over
    i think they replied as professional as they can why are you so butthurt you are not entitled to their time
  yeah wow first image smells like vendetta now cant complain about an artist being rude and refusing to talk about their techniques/process when literally one post over they politely answer someone else about their techniques/process
  thats not me but an example of why i dont ask other artists their techniques or try to ask them how they do xyz  you are not entitled to their time  of course not im just trying to make conversation with artists about things and i thought since we both like art maybe it would be an icebreaker that would lead to more than just a like or not replying at all  but if artists have this kind of attitude and think other artists are just competition i think i was wrong to try to befriend them or say anything nice to them jfc
  if you cant see the issue with the question in the first post then maybe theres a reason youre not getting polite replies also not everyone is looking for new friends online maybe they have had bad experiences in the past or maybe they prefer their irl friends so not every person is going to be interested in talking with you regardless of their popularity or personality
  uh youre not entitled to a conversation with strangers online shocking i know why do you just assume that a like is a bad thing i like comments all the time to let the person know that ive seen their reply and use it as a way of acknowledging what they said artists have lives outside of the internet too and they cant always respond to every reply or they might not feel comfortable enough going straight into friendly banter with someone theyve never interacted with before i know that when im busy i only generally respond to 1 people ive met irl before at cons or other settings and 2 people who i have an online familiarity with/have been commenting on my stuff for a while now     people not willing to expend emotional labor on a random online stranger is not the same thing as them thinking youre competition
  nayrt but is it fun ignoring context  thread started off with wondering how to improve reach on twitter answer was to network and make friends with other artists anon wants to know why they keep getting cold responses    yeah people are not required to respond positively but friend making doesnt just spontaneously develop and finding common ground is a good way to begin the process      main anon the best luck i have had for making friends is joining in on contests and doing trades it doesnt work with the big time artists but im able to interact more with up and coming artists
  im well aware of the context i even said that people who comment regularly are more likely to get a response than a one off comment acting like other artists are too scared to share their art tips because of competition when they dont respond is fucking stupid obviously friendship takes time to build which is exactly why you cant expect people to engage every single time when youre a stranger     it seems like were in agreement here so i dont even know what you have your panties in a twist about
  i think a few years ago i remember asking barachan about her crystal style at a con once and i made a remark like wow i thought this was like a texture overlay or something do you really do this by hand  and she replied with yes i do it by hand its really meticulous but the result is worth the effort    so i think the reason why she gave a standoffish remark is that its a style shes cultivated through lots of time and effort to be signature to her style but the asker is implying that everyone and their mother is doing this style and that its easy to replicate so they decided to just ask her how to do it like its a photoshop function or something
  i think the main problem here is that youre veiling a direct question about their methods with a silver lined compliment artists generally get turned off as soon as they feel like theyre being buttered up to get something out of them like oh i love your style its so pretty where do you get your x merchandise done  or how did you do x signature technique    it might be an innocent question but on the artistss end it just seems like a rando trying to extort them and once they give an answer theyll be dropped like a rock i think a lot of artists share this feeling so now theyre more wary of engaging people they dont know who ask stuff from them you might get more response if you just deliver the compliment instead
  yeah i can grasp the basic technique little angular blocks in analogous colors and varying brightness to mimic light refraction but im just wincing thinking about what a bitch and a half it must be
  vendetta  but whats shown in the image is the literal opposite of vendetta which would be if they had some preexisting grudge against the first asker the person asked like a twat and got a cold response meanwhile the person who asked nicely got a nice response
  yeah hearing that a technique you sunk a crazy amount of work into is everywhere on tumblr these days and since everyones doing it please just tell me how is possibly one of the worst ways to ask someone about their style yeesh
  i think they meant to imply the person posting the screenshot has the vendetta rather than the artist
  oh i think youre right lol nvm
  it really is quite different with crafts though theres less competition and more variance in medium so youre less likely to have crafters trying to steal your work    im also a crafter and i get a lot of people who ask how i make things who just are not interested in the answer at all once they realize how complicated it is
  dang 10 charms is weak whats good then i thought my 15 of each was pretty good
  hmmi personally think the person youre replying to is a bit of a dick since 10 charms each isnt bad if youre not doing this really intensely i go pretty hard on aa i have over 100 charm designs and sell 1050 of each really varies sometimes ill only sell one of a design and sometimes more at ax i printed 50 of my popular ones and ran out of them by day 2
    i have around 50 designs and i sell anywhere between 1015 of each design i also thought i was doing good lmao my price point is a little high but i dont really wanna lower it desu
    you guys are probably fine dont fall for overly antagonistic bait artists who say things like that are just trying to make everyone else feel bad probably because their lives are lacking in other areas
potentially stupid question but is this pricing normal am i missing something or did i set it up wrong i didnt expect the smaller prints to be more expensive to produce also do you guys typically do it the way i did multiple print design in one job as pages or do you do each design as a separate job
  theyre charging you for the extra effort of cutting 11x17 down to 11x14 typically i print two 11x85 prints on the 11x17 and cut it myself because its cheaper    iirc the amount is priced the same even if you did separate jobs because theres no minimum price breaks per page on catprint
  i make them seperate but i think the smaller size means extra labor which is why its so high
  11x17 is a very standardised size like 85x11    custom sizes are going to be more expensive
ive been tabling for around 2 years and this year at my recent cons ive had attendees come by saying that they have my stuff which is insanely amazing to hear at the same time im worried that im mainly recognizable by the meme ive drawn fanart of rather than my handle and other art since and im known as that artist    i met another artist that i havent met in a while and they heard my handle and didnt recognize me but the minute they saw my business card which has the meme on it they were like nope i know you    at this point the meme is my brand and while i love it the meme is getting old as in attendees are growing out of it and its already 56 years old and im afraid its all people will know me for im making other merch based on the meme but should i try to put more focus on making new merch has anyone else experienced this
  i dont really see a downside to this as long as you arent being recognized for something bad like saying or doing something horrible theres no downside to extra people knowing who you are even if its an old meme if you actively dont like being known for it then yea stop selling it but youd also have less people know who you are if you dont care about that at all then go ahead     people know my name but i dont know how ive made a few memes and some of my prints get popular online and people will say oh youre x person who drew that but every couple of years i have some new thing go viral so the x turns into something new seemingly with no connection to the previous thing at all im pretty ambivalent about it it just nets me more compliments at cons i guess i dont really care either way
  oh one more thing though the only issue i have with this is that i hang onto old prints some times because they are recognized but it doesnt mean they actually sell better so if your meme shit doesnt actually sell super well just ditch it if it does sell well not just getting recognized actually sells then keep it
who else is fucking stranded for animenyc    all flights cancelled
  i didnt try for anime nyc but that shit sounds like a nightmare godspeed man
does anime nyc sell no show tables
  local and bought a dealers table so i can set up today before the snow hit and not the day of but most of my other friends were not so lucky
  oof
  i have 2 friends flying in from socal stranded in atlanta because their 2nd leg got cancelled good luck to you anon hope you can arrive safely
  i crossboard to /ic/ for this exact reason   theyre top 5 currently for shilling artwork are cintiq 13 ipad pro xppen 15 huion 13pro and the microsoft surface pro    theyre all solid but the xppen huion 13 because pen tilt and ipad are best bang for the buck
mfw always see one of my fave artist attending cons almost every month sometimes twice a month in different states around the country    i cant imagine all the craziness involved hauling all that merch across country booking/paying hotels and plane expenses and then of course the frenzy of trying to actually get into multiple con aas every single month while drawing/posting art in between  how on earth do people do this dont get me wrong the hustle is admirable but it seems so exhausting
  well if youre full time it just means your weekends are your work days and your weekdays are your break days
  i imagine it not difficult if you only sell prints and charms restocking items doesnt require any effort  honestly the most annoying thing would be keeping track of when the con aa applications open i only go to around 5 or 6 cons a year and trying to keep track of them is so annoying idk why every con cant just let you sign up for a email list so theyll email you when applications open
  im a print artist and i do this fulltime im always exhausted the constant fear of missing aa sign ups is always in the back of my mind im constantly working on new prints while juggling booking flights and hotels for conventions ive been accepted to i have an online store that i have to keep up with and ship out orders twice a week between inventory for cons and my online store i just have new packages of prints arriving to my home on a weekly rolling basis its rough and im doing an awful job struggling to keep up but somehow i manage
id like to sell prints online but how do you package a print to send in the mail
  what is google
  come on man this is like basic ass info  really you couldnt google how to package prints
anyone think that group order for special shaped buttons cat star seems to be asking for too much the go host says its 120 per button and that just seems so high for an alibaba bulk order thats without shipping too ive always been itching to join but the go price doesnt look like a go price something like 050 or less per unit makes more sense to me for this type of product with that said have you guys ever had a bad experience with gos
  are they giving you a design limit iirc most alibaba manu charge per design that might be where the price comes from    that being said wouldnt it be easier to get them from a western manu anon there are a couple from mexico by now that charge about 60 cents
  just charge like 6 bucks for the button
almost out of the hole of hotel/flight/table for anime nyc hows everyone else fairing
  ulinecom is your friend
im not gonna lie pretty salty i didnt get into animenyc despite tabling last year
  yepp i feel the same let us take the brunt of the risk exhibiting at their con when it was their first year and then not even get accepted back in once their con starts taking off
  sameeee  i hear sales are pretty slow this year too though
  at that price youre probably better off making cat/star shaped acrylic charms or acrylic pins
sorry to sperg in this thread    theres this artist that always pops up in my explore feed of instagram that grinds my gears they basically only make kirby pins but they are traced from kirby toys and figures it feels like they are trying to add an extra sneaky factor to the fact that they trace instead of using artwork itself i know bootleg/traced pins is common but it feels like they are just extra shady about it    kirby is my precious son please dont do this
  im very very tired
  most people who got in are really good but there are a few with teeerrrribblleee art like theres tables that only have 4 or 5 bad drawings just laying flat on the table
  welp that explains why all the artists i follow that are tabling there are constantly posting about how theyre selling there also the con looks pretty crowded so im wondering why the sales are so slow
  hey ive seen those around too  i always thought the images were fishy looking and now i know why its a shame because theyre really cute
  as an attendee heres my experience the cons crowded but there are way too many tables even though they have great stuff nothing stands out because every tables kind of got the same stuff more or less they needed to jury for more variation theres only like 3 crafters
  weird i thought the reason some didnt get in is because they juried with more variety in mind i know some veteran aa people with great art that didnt get in either im not sure what it is they are looking for
  their applications are open for wayyyy too long if the con switched to a fcfs with a small window like ax sales would improve for everyone
  id prefer more variation in fandoms pretty much every table had the same stuff  ffxv voltron marvel and so on
  fcfs is terrible shorter window is fine remember anime boston we do not want fcfs but also i am thinking they prefer print artists to crafters it seems on jury
  just continuously post more instagram is pretty generous
  anyc isnt as big as aboston though and attendees here seem way more stingy so i dont think there would be as much competition for tableslike almost everyone i know says ab is their anchor con and makes their year and i dont think anyc is at that level yet
  there was a pretty decent competition for tables year
do you guys have any recommendations for printers im looking at the canon pixma pro100 right now but im not sure if its really worth splurging on    ideally id like to start printing my own prints stickers and supplying my own buttons next year but im interested in your experiences did you think it was worthwhile or did you find yourself still outsourcing some of your merch anyways
  i bought a pixma pro100 in january because above all i value being able to update my stock more at my discretion that relying totally on an outside printer but theres a definite learning curve if youve never worked with professional grade printing before    i suppose it was worth it once i finally found the type of paper i liked note that not all paper works well on it even if its labelled inkjet paper it might be shit personally i use finestra arts inkjet paper ive gotten the best results with that and i print all my stickers on inkjet sticker paper and that works fine generally    also you will only save actual money vs a print shop if you go through the hassle of using noncanon cheap inks with a feeder system but i havent bothered to set one up yet    imo its worth it if you value your business being as independent as possible you just have to account for the learning curve and potential dumb printer hassles that all printers have    also i got mine with a 200 rebate if canons not offering one right now i would wait until they do though i assume they might be offering something with black friday/cyber monday
  i did my own kiss cut stickers for a while and ive done buttons myself before too and imo the time and labor spent making that shit at home is a huge fucking waste ill outsource any day now because i can not waste my waking hours baby sitting a cutter or punching away
  something else you have to think about is that the quality of the prints will go down over time unless you keep the printer very clean  i have a cheap canon pixma and it printed really good at first but almost 3 years later the print quality is really bad and its impossible to get inside there and actually clean it manually  there is no real cost savings and the hassle it takes isnt worth it if you are super small scale or just want to run a test batch to see how well a design sells its fine but not worth it in the long run
    yeah ofc i find tracing/art theft annoying in this case i guess im extra annoyed because they pastelfy the images to fit their brand and use tactics like switching a few things around/flipping images so its less noticeable its a trace     these are the other ones where i recognize the source right away although im sure they trace other stuff too i think the sleepy kirby from the first image is referenced/loosely traced from the same set as the dedede kirby twinkle dolly
  why on earth do they need to trace preexisting kirby images when kirby is literally one of the easiest things to draw
acens sending out acceptance emails
  the second one is really bugging me i feel like the lack of lines in the star and the subtly off angle of the sides of the crystals bring it down so much
how accurate have you guys found printing apparel through arts // cow to be say if i had a straight vertical stripe on the side of a shirt or skirt would it likely be correctly placed or do they have a high/loose margin of error
im thinking of doing resin jewlery at a small local con next year where would be the best place to get premade resin pieces and plastic chain     preferably in canada since i dont want to pay wallet rape shipping
  the craft/handmade/hobby thread would be a better place to ask that kind of stuff but the most likely answer youll get will be alibaba
so how many people actually ended up going to anime nyc this year i want to know their numbers   i really hope they blow up as a convention
  premade resin pieces and plastic chain    uhhhhh so all your doing is attaching the charm to a chain
  seriously i shat out a joke image of kirby with a knife in about half an hour at most and its pretty much just a completely normal looking kirby
  no i make resin jewelry and im fine with casting my own i just wanted to find a place to buy the tiny little stars and the super thin flat pieces because mine rarely turn out right    i assemble all of it myself its not just charm on a chain
anyone get into c2e2
  i didnt despite tabling there this year but a friend of mine got in and offered to share so i guess im still going
  i heard it was way busier than last year sales were slow though i still made money but sales really not what they should have been for the size
i cannot for the life of god find any frames that fit a5 paper does anyone know where to get some decent a3 or a5 frames in the us i can only find us sized picture frames
how does sakimichan get away with drawing and selling almost only fanart doesnt all her attention bring more people seeing her meaning more chance for her to get hit with a cd
  nevermind disregard this message ill just do a custom size frame with a mat
  drawing fanart isnt illegal and shes technically not selling anything via patreon people are voluntarily donating to her while she draws fanart of her own free will    at least thats what i assumed because i had also thought about this except my angle was wouldnt all these companies want to stop the pornography lol
does anyone know if moo cow allows nsfw content to be printed if its drawn
   tickets were sold out on certain days so they were technically at cap too for the sat for the square footage i guess minus maybe a couple hundred if there were unsold badges sitting at the local comic shops unless they expand next year its going to be the same
  have any of you tabled at momocon ive stuck with texas and havent gone to any atlanta cons other than dragoncon as an attendee they want 275 so im debating if the sales will be worth it
  ahegao shirts were originally printed on there so mmmmmaybe
  momocon is good just one step down from the most lucrative cons like fanime its at the same time as fanime so most people apply to both and see which one they get into although i dont know anyone thatd pick momocon over fanime
zenkaicon acceptances went out what the fuck is wrong with the east coast cons in always accepting the same people in someone brought it up a few threads ago    i always see the same people saying they got in and the same people saying they got waitlisted/rejected when it comes to east coast conventions some of them are a lot better than the people getting in too    someone even commented in the zenkaicon thread that it was surprising someone didnt get in since they got in previous years i guess there are some exceptions but still
how do yall ship stuffed pillows with charms/stickers/postcards my pillows are pretty big so theyll be going into a 14x19 poly bag mailer but i usually ship charms in 4x6 bubble mailers    trying to figure out shipping for black friday and cyber monday as well as whats the best overall discount
can we talk about black friday/cyber monday deals for art supplies programs and equipment    im personally trying to look for some good deals for a cintiq or surface pro also do you think clip studio paint will do a black friday/cyber monday deal this year for ex and pro they havent announced anything yet
  all i know is that i have to resist canvas sales this year because i have like 50 blank canvases in the garage id love to see copics go on sale but theyre getting some good competition lately so cheaper options may still be more viable    good luck on the cintiq best thing ive ever bought
  thanks for the info i teach full time so i havent built my shit up enough to justify flying in to sell at a con yet but i will shoot for momocon
  ive had this issue with this con and a couple others run with a lot of the same staff ill even have nonartist alley staff approach me at other cons saying i should apply for their artist alley and they always look so uncomfortable when i tell them that ive been trying but i keep getting waitlisted /
anyone run into the problem of vograce not accepting lanyard designs over 90 cm have been doing them longer for a while now and suddenly coco wont let me bc their machines are different and now im annoyed af already paid and everything ugh
  nvm got a little hasty with my irritation appears to have been a miscommunicationfor now haha
  ive seen sketchbook pro subscriptions go on sale from black friday till the end of year if youre interested i got my copy of csp during a black friday sale a few years ago as well
anyone else having trouble filing taxes for californian permits  i know theres a new system but it keeps saying no action or payment is needed even though my temp permit already expired
is a heartshaped button maker worth it ive heard several stories about it being more annoying than the average button maker because the mylar gets stuck or something
  consider the time making art vs money saved and also that you will need to get a cutter otherwise you will hate yourself
  i think most people get heart buttons manufactured nowadays because the cost outweighs the time/labor saved imo also in my experience with a button maker borrowed a friends theres a moderate defect rate because its actually quite difficult to punch that angle in a heart i find that the mylar rarely sits perfectly flush in the top center of the heart but its usually not a huuuuge deal to customers but can be annoying sometimes if its worse than usual
  er sorry i mean the time/labor saved outweighs the cost
  i have one it pays itself back but its fucking annoying to deal with like someone else said higher rate of defects mostly due to the stupid mylar dont
which one of you idiots shared the acen registration link
  it was me sorry muh bad
anyone know why the fuck not a single order ive shipped to mexico has been delivered all say in transit even orders from march  i feel shitty but i took off mexico for places im able to ship to because it was too expensive having to keep shipping out replacements and those still dont ever arrive is their shipping just abysmal and takes six months or something
  soo how do you properly secure something like this to a table
  our postal system got partially privatized and it was a clusterfuck plus our customs have been overwhelmed for a while due to the main airport being too small for the contry my advice is to either insist on a tracking number or using a private courier its mostly regular mail that really gets lost
  she ought to be using clamps on the back of it its understandable when you build something like this that you might feel its secure but its not taking into account people walking by bumping it customers messing with it etc so having it clamped even if you feel its steady without it is always a good idea she could have also zip tied the sign up top having anything heavy thats sitting loose above waist height is just asking for trouble really
  like the other anon said she should hve clamped it to the table i think the biggest issue is having that sign up top though since thats what caused the injury ive had neighbors wire cubes fall on me before but i was fine since they didnt have anything sharp on top that could hurt me honestly i wouldnt hang a heavy frame on there either like shes done just prints  wire cubes wont hurt anyone but things with sharp edges like the plastic sign holder and the frame definitely will she could have maybe mitigated the damage if she used more of the wire cubes to enclose the plastic sign holder like make side and back panels so the sign cant slide off but i would just put the sign on the table altogether to avoid any sort of accidents
  bruh the only country id consider blocking sales from is mexico just because of how much headache their podtal system has given me compared to other locations i sigh everytime i get an order from mexico
  i block all south and middle american countries too many fraudulent purchases to my shop where the parents claim they never made the purchase then get refunded fuck them
  can you specify what south american countries might as well add them and save me the time since i already blocked mexico
  3 of them were from mexico 2 fraud from brazil and 1 from argentina between 20152017
  and i feel like all of them knew that tracking never updated to show delivery so they came up with the same excuses of either my kid ordered this i want a refund and it never arrived i want a refund the only country outside of those are australia with a high package loss rate but enough orders to currently still make it worth it
  what kind of shop platform do you have im kind of wary of this now i dont think theres any way to block this kind of thing on etsy
  no im on etsy go to your shipping preferences that area where you pick what shipping method you provide and unclick mexico took like two seconds
  i block almost every country that does not do tracking with usps for all the same reasons i just dont offer shipping to everywhere else and only ship to those like 1013 countries
any krauts around with experiences at dokomi fanbooth  aa table there right
  im on etsy it has no protections against tracking that drops off at destination countries
  yeah
  it was alright not worth the flight over again this year personally
  which 13 do you ship to
  i took it off the usps site at the time but countries that officially have delcon might be different now mine is currently australia canada denmark finland france germany ireland italy japan new zealand portugal spain netherlands uk    occasionally i get someone on twitter or some such asking me to send them stuff to their country but once they hear my shipping price the full 14 most go away lol
when it comes to price signage at your table and prints do you    refer to prints by general sizesposter/large medium small/postcard  refer to prints by specific size11x17 85x11 5x7 etc    im going to label pretty much everything with a price but id still like to have some signs saying what price a print is based on size
sorry if this isnt the right place to ask but i figure you guys might have a good answer haha what should i do with my prints somehow ive finally hit the point where i have no more space on my bedroom walls
  rotate them put a different print up in place of another    i decorate according to season and like to put up prints that match the color and aesthetic
  get a binder and turn them into a book of sorts
  
  put them on the ceiling i always had posters up there as a kid and theyre great to stare at before you go to bed just be careful with how you stick them up there like i dont recommend tacks
  picked up painter 2019 for 99 feels good upgrading from painter 11 x
  ive had customers get portfolio cases and just make them into these giant book portfolios
is asking for supplier suggestions allowed     asking cos ive been looking for weeks and havent found one that doesnt ask for 500moq per design    does anyone know a good supplier for custom printed business card/polaroid folders like pic related ive looked on alibaba with a load of terms and feel like giving up soon
        thank you everyone for responding ill start rotating them while i keep the others in a binder i didnt think of sticking them on the ceiling thats some good free space i should utilize   im sorry but im gonna ask another question is there anywhere specific i should buy a portfolio/binder a lot of my prints are a2 but the ones in that size im finding are 70 which is out of my price range haha clear sleeves are real pricy too man being an artist must be expensive i hope you guys are doing well with your artist alley ventures
  itoya
  heres a 13 x 19 one randomly googling     
      i second itoya yeah art is pricey at times but its the only thing besides junk food and video games i spend my money on anyway so i dont mind as much
  i read the sticky but im just curious where do you guys get your stickers printed from im kind of a noob
      i would add stickerapp to the resources in that doc i like them
hey gulls what sites would you recommend for selling besides etsy craft type items not prints ive been hearing a lot of bad things about etsy being terrible with fees but i also know that they have the most reach i know storeenvy is an option is that pretty good     thanks gulls im just kind of overwhelmed with everything and not sure what the best platform is
has anyone tried semicutouts like pic related i was thinking would anyone be interested for something like that for exaple lolita girl with cut out headbow dress and shoes and you could choose yourself what kind of dress etc it would have
  they make nice staged photos but you cant mount or frame them and unless youre traveling constantly youll very quickly run out of interesting backgrounds
  i guess it might be neat if you provided some prints of landscapes or patterns with them so the customer can have a displayable piece they can change the look of whenever they feel like it obviously they could just get backgrounds themselves but i feel like people wouldnt go for it if they just look at the cutout
    i would recommend stickerhub they have a great price per sheet for kiss cut stickers
anyone ever promoted a game on their aa table i was wondering what sort of promotion material would be a good idea to do flyers codes to play the demo version
  what sort of game i think having a demo is relatively important unless you already have a following in which case you also need space for people to stand/sit and most tables dont have that
  get a small monitor or tablet and have a demo video of the game play on loop with a sign above/below it with a business card detailing how to purchase/download the game
  ive been working on and off on a visual novel for a while and wondering the same i think a demo is a good idea on paper but you need to think about how long the demo will take to play how many people can play/watch it at once without crowding your table too much to sell at and whether you are willing or able to provide seating for someone to play it if theres even room i feel like a screen set up with a short looped nonplayable demo would be good something people can stare at for like 12 minutes tops    some other things ive considered are business card sized illustrations with the demo code/itchio link on the back cheap as shit to make and wide dispersal or a flyer/brochure/postcard sized print styled as a tourist ad for the game setting but with details about the game itself and link inside or on the back more effort and money might request a tiny donation to get one especially if its a postcard print with actual nice art in both cases you should probably have some kind of signage nearby telling people what the fuck it is that its an original game    ive seen some vn and game creators get cardboard standees or little acrylic stands of the characters to help advertise too if you feel like spending the money
  to piggyback off of  an ipad/tablet with a looping video that previews the game set up at the table would be a good idea i think
how do you go about finding manufacturers for making custom journals enamel pins and omanjuus is it just diving straight into alibaba and hoping for the best/comparing company ratings and how long theyve been in business    not looking for anyone to share their manu just looking for tips on manu searching
  a mix of networking through my art peers the wider my net the more chances ill know an artist wholl know a manu for the thing i want made asking my current manu to expand on their products and yes just diving through alibaba there are some manus on taobao too but i dont speak chinese
any cyber monday deals  i havent found much but i assume theres probably something good right now
  4over4 is doing a 40 off thing
did catprint get rid of their matte option
  catprints and overnightprint zap creatives i believe is doing 25 off clear charms
  they got rid of it satin is the closest thing now i think or the same thing
  i never got matte but i just made an order with satin and glossy and honestly they almost look exactly the same to me slightly more shiny on the glossy where i had blank white space thats it
how in the fuck does the post office mix up a label that was attached to a package they sent my customer someone elses order completely with the label that i put on the package myself how do i contact them about this mix up
  do you know how plain compares
  they dropped matte back in sept
for those that travel to overseas cons do you ever have any issues when declaring and bringing your inventory or is it basically just like flying to any domestic con just more airport lines
  you should order a sample pack from the website its very useful
new thread 
say goodbye to lobby conners now you need a con badge appointment at the spa or a gaylord room key to be on the premises during the convention im glad to see them finally doing something about all the extra people
facebook post about the new policy    fbcom/katsuninjas/posts/10156278081659398
laughing my ass off at the entitled tards complaining that katsu should discount badges and that they wouldve bought it earlier if they knew  youre supposed to buy badges in the first place to go they didnt even have to make this announcement they couldve just sprung it up at the convention katsu doesnt owe you shit
she deleted her posts but i was legit laughing at gaius cosplay shouting how all her friends are going to throw an anti katsucon con at the mgm this year also see so many entitled photographers bitching about buying a badge now you motherfuckers can charge hundreds to shoot but cant afford to shell out 70 bucks get bent
  hell ive been lobbyconning katsu for years and im glad theyre finally doing this im always willing to reg i just never do anything that requires a badge so ive just never done it hopefully this cuts down a lot on the crowds and the entitled cosplayers and photogs who are only there for the photo ops
  ugh samefag  to add that people crying about discounts is definitely hilarious if you can afford to travel to katsu anyway there should be no reason to cry about your precious budget
  sweet sensations and athel rogers are already crying and theyre photographers who charge over 100 per shoot at katsu while ghosting it
all people have to do is cutback on some small things and they can afford a badge like doing less new costumes this is just hilarious how pissed people are
    the amount of comments dragging athel for his entitled bitching is incredible top kek for the evening
lol at people complaining about paying 70 for a weekend con while these people that are bitching most likely earn a salary of over 50k in the dc area fuck those broke ass entitled shits
my favorite thing is all the people who are like this is going to make it so that everyone who wants to enjoy the con for free can no longer do so no shit if you want to go to the con buy a badge
photogs roaming the con with 10k camera gear  cant afford a con badge
  im a mega poorfag for someone who goes to as many cons as i do but even i think people whining about this are just fucking cheap if you really cant shuffle your budget around and come with the money for an actual badge you dont need to be there
i wish more cons would do this
  no one cares about gaius cosplay for her to start her own convention shes a used up slag whore for uv photography
  you laugh but the amount of people crying says its needed to be said no participation awards here
  i dont care either shes an untalented hack i was just laughing at her claims funny how fast she deleted her comments
  isnt athel a cuck anyway i remember the name coming up following the colossalcon drama
    he was called out for not having any portfolio diversity after colossalcon hes still throwing a temper tantrum on his personal and is threatening a friend sweep because people are calling him a little bitch for whining about having to pay 70 for a badge when one of his shoots costs 120 he bragged about being completely booked but is still advertising himself to cosplayers so it really looks like he isnt doing as well as he wants us to believe kek its some emcp tier shit rofl
  emcp wont be there since he always ghosted katsu and i doubt theyll ever have him on staff anymore after the amount of complaints on him
  god i see photog friends bitching and i know for a fact they make over 2k from shoots at this con every year
  hes a pretty shit photographer the examples on his page are pretty much the best possible shots what he gives back after shoots doesnt compare in quality he likes to shoot asian girls but unless youre his friend or hes thirsting after you the shots will still turn out mediocre
  sweet sensations cries about having to pay for any badge a local small con has had to raise their prices due to unforeseen expenses and she recently went on a rantfest about how the pricetag is obscene and nobody should attend all while stating that she hasnt attended in years and never planned on it    is it just me or is it mostly children under 18 and photographers who are constantly trying to cheapskate cons out of badge fees
  the good thing about this news is at least i know which of my friends are good people and which phoitographers are worth working with just for morale reasons alone    seen a few past ghosters who also are smart to stay silent and just noddingly agree with the policy change waiting to see the fallout when magfest announces it now
  tbh i ghost katsu every year and i still agree with the policy change im not delusional enough to think that i deserve any accommodations because i didnt plan to get a badge tbh this really only affects the room stuffers who also ghost since being a registered guest clears you as well
this means that for the duration of the convention weekend the gaylord national resort and convention center will only be accessible to people wearing  or in the process of obtaining  a katsucon membership badge registered gaylord national guests or guests with a confirmed restaurant or spa appointment this is not in response to any particular threat or incident but is instead a proactive measure katsucons closed profile will allow a greater degree of safety for all attendees guests and staff and brings our convention in line with other large events held at the gaylord national throughout the year    later they admitted that it was for security    respectfully this wasnt something that was planned months ago it was fairly recent due to incidents that have happened at events
heres the rates of one of the photogs who were salty about the closed con he posted it right after the news was announced 70 dollars extra for an extra person and 5 images how fucking obvious can you get dont fucking go if you dont want to pay for a badge    that aside 170 dollars 10070 is a lot of fucking money for 5 images of 2 people that are average shots at best     if said photog had specified that duos would get more photos on return maybe the price would seem more reasonable lmao
  heres the image didnt realize it didnt post
  all of these photogs can easily buy a badge with all the money they get from booking requests they just do not want to pay
  thats because its a mandate from the gaylord not katsucon a few magfest staffers have also already mentioned on their own private pages a similar announcement will be coming from magfest soon
  a few are already making fun of the ghosting photographers and i support it 100
  she cries poverty but her parents deadass bought her a house lmaoooooooo
  the facebook page says that the decision was made by katsucon itself with coordination with the gaylord national
  be happy they arent doing mandatory bag checks and metal detectors like the dc convention center does with otakon and awesome con
  otakon does not do metal detectors only bag checks more and more convention centers are doing bag checks these days pretty much any venue in dc i enter is doing it and cons in various cities are as well
  no it doesnt it says in coordination with the gaylord
  regardless of who made the decision the gaylord would have to be involved in order to enforce it
   the examples on his page are pretty much the best possible shots what he gives back after shoots doesnt compare in quality   not to defend him but doesnt every photog do this
  no usually photos are somewhat comparable in quality what kind of shit photogs do you work with its understandable that you post the best shots but not when you dont put any effort into work that you do for your customers
  most of my friends who worked with him had bad experiences with the quality he gave back and how unprofessional he is none of this surprises me
  most photographers can produce the same quality for their shots not just a handful of good shots and edits from a whole batch unless theyre one of the photographers that run their photos through the same presets every single time    like you take 50 photos and only three are good thats bad same if all 50 look exactly the same that can be bad you want to be able to show off multiple photos with different tweaks to show your editing ability but also not show that you only know how to edit one way
  magfest is gonna eliminate ghosting too  fuck i always pay for katsucon because i like the panels but i only ever ghost magfest on the single day that theres the spike chunsoft photoshoot
you all realize the legality of this if i go to the hotel space and buy a starbucks they cannot kick me out im a customer additionally how do they intend to determine who is a hotel guest is the hotel providing the convention staff with its guest information
  its perfectly legal because they wont even let you on premises unless you show you have a reservation or a room key a registered hotel guest will have a room key you retard have you never heard of booking a venue for an event
hahaha    hm they statement clearly states spa or restaurant reservations they ignore the other services they sell on hotel premise addiionally i am talking hotel space not convention space as a hotel guest i do not need to show convention staff a key card and by your fucked logic i would losing my key card and selling the ones that are de activated
  dragoncon already bars people without a badge or key card from entering the host hotels    try again
  if you have a reservation at spa or hotel theyll have a record of it since this decision was made in conjunction with the gaylord i would assume the gaylord will provide the necessary information to enforce it you realize they dont actually have to let you in to go buy coffee right  theres no reason for you to be wandering around the hotel with a spa or restaurant reservation i dont think you understand its a closed profile event which means the hotel space is the convention space and even if it wasnt even if you were a registered guest a hotel has every right to ask you to leave the premises if you dont comply with their rules if youre unwilling to prove youre a guest they can do the same unless you have a reason for it say trying to sneak into an event hosted by the hotel no guest is going to refuse to show any proof that theyre staying in a hotel while still loitering in the lobby freeloaders are pretty obvious    also learn to reply butthurt newfag
  like you take 50 photos and only three are good thats bad    3/50 is bad  time to throw my dslr away
very nice insults i only give you a b    you made an assumption i will go with it it would be bothersome if the gaylord gave volunteer staff my personal information     additionally now is i have a spa or resteraunt reservation i get my very own gaylord hotel staff assistant to babysit me such quality service     also redundant statement if i am a guest the hotel has record of it convention staff does not there is a clear difference between them one of them get paid and have hr benefits if you get an adult job one day you too may have these yourself     as a businessman it is not uncommon for me to meet other individuals i know when they visit at a hotel bar such as the gaylord for a few drinks i do not need to be sneaky so lets recap    i would love to have the convention clearly state that all other forms of sales such as coffee is limited to only guests and attendees    now for some fun    fine i accept your logic till end of days so i will simply surpass it     if you are in my hotel room at gaylord and are buying a badge i will not list you formally as a guest in that room not needed as badge or proof of hotel stay is needed i will then simple offer to put others who do not have badges as guests in my room now as far as hotel list is concerned they are guests    clearly there are implications to this but if thats the logic the convention and venue shall use clearly its terribly flawed anyway and this has become a fun game for me     ok your turn  see how i did not need to insult people when i use logic
  see 
already addressed both key cards and badges but thank you for not reading next how many staff can we get arguing on this thread
  additionally now is i have a spa or resteraunt reservation i get my very own gaylord hotel staff assistant to babysit me such quality service  im sorry due to conflicting schedules we will have to cancel and reschedule your spa/restaurant reservation for another date    better yet the gaylord institutes blackout days during the duration of the con where you cant reserve the spa unless you have a concurrent reservation with the hotel    dont play the rules lawyer game in a city full of lawyers bruh
thanks for that wonderful update    4chan is now a city full of lawyers you heard it here first    i am not your buddy pal    i love new information its a good thing only idiots fear information
    see 
  making a 150 spa reservation that wont even get you access to programming rooms because youre so assrashed about paying katsucon 70 for the convention you have no business attending for free
  oh wait im sorry a 150 reservation that wont even get you into the hotel for more than one day    please so this though i cant wait to see all of the salty crybabies try to beat the system this way as though door check is not common at many many other cons already
  4chan is now a city full of lawyers you heard it here first  you have a reading comprehension problem
  on top of a reality comprehension problem must be a hard life
  if you have an adult job why the hell wouldnt you just pay the 70 to buy the badge for the con instead of arguing about how clever you think you are on 4chan     this has become a fun game for me are you gonna write katsucons name in the deathnote now fuck were hosed
  a hotel isnt a public space its semiprivate so they can determine whos allow on premises
  or learn to improve which is the cheaper or best option
  good sick and tired of katsu cosplayers clogging the damn atrium around the gazebo go take your anime cosplay somewhere else
  as a businessman it is not uncommon for me to meet other individuals i know when they visit at a hotel bar such as the gaylord for a few drinks i do not need to be sneaky    you arent a business man youre a 15 year old whos buttflustered he might have to spend his years income on a con ticket    also hotel/con staff can absolutely tell the difference between a businessman who just happens to be at the hotel and a little shit trying to game the system theyre going to have it in writing that nobodys allowed in but only bother actually going after the obvious dumbasses
  no
  itt arrogant poser photog about to get a trespass charge
  you are not allowed in the hotel space to even go to the starbucks go ahead try it and see what happens uv photography learned the hard way what its like to fuck with hotel and convention staff you are not above the rules and not even close to important enough for them to waive them for you
  katsucon takes over the entire hotel any other guest is there for other events they are registered for     i love how these edge lords thing they are slick
  this whole post
  what happened to uv 
  he got banned from awa for doing that i dont have the whole story of why but i think he got arrested
  as a businessman it is not uncommon for me to meet other individuals i know when they visit at a hotel bar such as the gaylord for a few drinks i do not need to be sneaky    this is what i imagine you look like
  unhand me sir i always wear my ua school uniform and green wig when i go to my corporate seminars
  bro i used to work as a night manager at a hotel people did that trick all the time with prostitutes saying its my guest bro its a fucking ho this is why some extreme hotels have the one person per bed rule because prostitution is rampant for meetings the business hotels had the day passes or they were doing hiring conferences where everyone who was going to be in and out was put on a list that the hotel had     hotels have to legally have a record of everyone at the hotel for the day businesses they have lists you literally have no idea how much of a nightmare conventions are for hotels and why badging exists if the hotel wanted to be dicks they would do the 10 rule and check 10 of rooms for stuffing and seeing who was on the lists i really want them to start doing this and cutting back on stuffing and fucking minors     tldr you are dumb
    checking rooms for stuffing    man could imagine if any con hotel especially hotels attached to the venue did this so many people would be fucked but at the same time almost all venue hotels know this goes on during the events hell this year at awa the lady said will 6 keys be enough for a room with 2 beds      but all in all i think this is a great idea  ive never been to katsucon  but i think any con that has a hotel attached to the venue could benefit from this if you cant afford the 70 for a badge why the fuck are you at a con in the first place    and lol to all the butthurt photographers i know camera equipment isnt exactly cheap and youve got the cost of travel etc but if you didnt factor that into the 100 per person shoots you do then gloating about being fully booked the whole weekend if you can afford the extra money for a badge then fuck you and your camera    dragoncon has been doing this for a while now ive also been told they black out any type of reservations for the bars / restaurants /etc in the area to prevent people from using that as a loophole i believe the gaylord will probably be doing the same
  i mean my keeper shots are improving  keepershit ratio is fucked though
  this is so much reddit spacing it has to be ironic right
how many times am i going to see aphotographer start off their ad with them being a professional photographer are they published too
    sounds like a new drinking game
   this has to be a shitpost right
  nibba
    got screen caps i cant find where this was happening want to show my friends to warn them about athel
  a lot of it was happening on the posts of other cosplay photographers hes friends with but you can see some of them on the katsucon post announcing the badge requirement too
  nah he deleted his post there last night i know at least one person took screencaps though
  fuck any anon got them caps want to see the self righteous bs he always show up on my feed bragging about how easy its to make money off weebs
most people bitching dont even know what theyre talking about like this idiot whos complaining about all the issues with katsucon except its mostly gaylord related
  was hoping to see the repost of him arguing about getting a badge discount
im curious to see how they enforce this i went to ax and stayed at a hotel where they used wristbands to try to prevent room stuffing it was fairly easy to get access by trading them off like some people do with badges at a normal con idk although this will obviously cut down on ghosting im not sure if it will help with people actually staying at the hotel
holy shit that facebook thread     spergery and cosplay are like peanut butter and jelly
god the people bitching about he badge thing is too much ive been attending katsucon for years and never had a problem paying for a badge gas food and hotel because i plan in advance if youre going to a huge con known for being in a pricey location should you not expect to maybe budget it really seems like everyone complaining is either a minor who cant afford a badge or a cheapskate whos used to lobby conning     ghosting for the sake of profiting off a con like so many photogs do is an entirely different thing but even more irritating     heres hoping the policy actually cuts down the number of people trying to be cheap
    i dont think i got caps of that but hopefully another gull comes through
  i joined a group and one of the runners messaged us like i cant do my cosplay for this anymore because katsucon is making us buy badges and that was my costume budget  and it launched a discussion on how omg i know i never buy badges idk if i can go now and its like howdo you go to a convention and not plan to pay for the convention    im 24 now and the number of people my age or older that pull the i cant afford x but im going to blankcon and bringing 20 new cosplays kofi depending and also bitch about ghosting is insane arent we at the age where were saving for like houses and stuff like that cons are a vacation and a privilege not a right conventions dont owe you shit
  its people like that that never grew out of their broke teenaged weeb days where you could stuff 10 people in a room and live off junk food and free water all weekend
  i dont mind being in a room that is slightly more full than it should be more for convenience than money because ive stayed by myself outside the harbor before and it was really inconvenient if peaceful but i always buy a badge i also dont overfill rooms if im the one booking     i used to know people who ghosted frequently by buying one or two badges for their group and swapping them around when they wanted to go to the dealers room or the aa their justification was that they were going to spend the money theyd waste on badges by commissioning artists or buying merch     fwiw the reason im not friends with them anymore is because they charged parking to a room in my name it was a suite and never paid me for that or their portion of the room and lied about it after the con insisting they had paid me in cash people who ghost have ethical issues if your friends ghost regularly they may fuck you over too
    while not for stuffing for those extra special rooms that try to hang banners they had security go inside and take them down when people werent there
should i start booking shoots now or sometime in january  pls respond am photog
  wait till january ffs i hate when i see photographers opening their shoots up four months in advance before anyone knows what their cosplay schedule is
  charge cheap and youll get bookings too many photographers asking people to pm them for prices which reeks of cringe sure these assholes are giving away free or cheap shoots to good cosplayers without trying to alert others the rest are the mid to high price ones but at least theyre up front with prices    dont be one of those asses that jumps on a cosplayer announcing theyre cosplaying and start listing your rates unless they say theyre looking to book paid shoots
  how do you git gud at cosplay photography im not looking to do it for anything besides practice but i still want to get good practice what lens do you usually use 50mm
  it will it wont prevent ghosting completely but it will help cut down on it a lot      just practice a lot scenery objects people    just practice a lot
ive been sneaking into cons for over 10 years if you need a badge just steal one off of someone taking a photo they always put their bags down like clockwork whenever you ask for a photo    this isnt going to stop anyone
  now youre just a thief
  nice fantasy youve got a couple problems with your story though    you specifically say you steal off of cosplayers taking random hall photos and not in the middle of a photoshoot but anyone stopping for a hall photo is going to just set their bag down within a foot or two  if the badge is in the bag its probably not easily visible or visible at all its inside the bag unless you got lucky and the lanyard is hanging over the edge its going to take several seconds to go diving  at least one person is literally staring at the cosplayer being photographed you think they arent going to notice some rando ducking into their shoot and rummaging around in the cosplayers bag    and of course    the badge check is at the con entrance dipshit nobody is going to take a photo for you outside the con center in the freezing cold
  sure these assholes are giving away free or cheap shoots to good cosplayers without trying to alert others  what would your first thoughts be if i posted an ad saying id be doing free shoots but only for characters/cosplays that i am familiar with
  i am following this because i would do the same thing
  some of us are being booked now when we are still on current conventions and have slight backlogs please i beg of you let me breath
  thoughtful practice ie you cant just shoot and expect to get good it isnt like working out where unironically doing it will get you fit by sheer time prison syndrome but you have to take a photo and when you are at the pc think about what made that photo good or bad internalize it and then keep doing that never stop thinking about the photo and make it part of the process
  anon its your bookings you can tell people you are not opening katsucon slots until january  nobody is forcing you to take on new clients before youre ready
  it depends on your quality of work if your example photos are garbage then youll still get garbage applicants im friends with a lot of photographers who will only shoot what they like some for free some for a fee and it works out well for them
  how do they turn down those that they dont like
  in their advertisement they state that their shoots are not first come first serve and submitting the form does not guarantee a slot and also after the form closes they will notify those they chose i think they just post on social media that all applicants have been chosen so they dont contact every single person they didnt pick they always receive way more requests than they can shoot so even the ones who charge have the freedom to pick things they are more excited about shooting
  oops  is for 
    thanks  will keep that in mind when i eventually post my ad
  pick and choose is basically code for asian or hot cosplayers only no blacks or fatties check their portfolio its obvious
  someone posts their portfolio  its legitimately all asians
  who the fuck would want to shoot uggos and fatties tho if they can choose
  nobody is obligated to shoot your lazy ugly cosplay especially if they arent charging
  i think if you state that youre looking to do this for free because its a hobby for you that you want to get better at and then list the characters/shows youd be interested in doing shots for youd be fine    unless that list is simply made up of boudoir shoots
  thats why you dont book with athel
  no you dont book with him cause his result looks nothing like his promos not because he doesnt shoot ugly people
  actually his promote card changed for the last few cons its no longer all asians and he sprinkled some blacks on his feed     ash b called him out after last colossalcon prime and amie photo did the the same right before otakon
  seconding this unless youre cute or asian his photos are boring as fuck its like hes not even trying
  more photographers need calling out tired of shitty ones being tossed about as awesome when most seem to be mediocre while decent photographers are buried thanks to people being buddybuddy with certain cosplayers and cosplay photography share pages which are just a cancer on instagram
  see    
  no point look at photographers that molested or sexually assaulted cosplayers they just change their names and people shoot with them again you also have cosplayers who defend creepers with bs like oh hes a nice guy and youre a liar same with those who take money and run off
  change their names  give examples pls
    we are talking about photographers who are charging upward of 195 per photoshoot they should not discriminate if theyre taking money
  blue shell and robert hoang are two fine examples 100 certified creepers
  robert hoang  is he seriously still shooting under a different name  i figured with how much shit he got when he was blacklisted people would have caught on if he simply changed his name and continued to shoot that seems like way too much of a comically easy way to circumvent the blacklist
  blue shell changed to just cosplay and nobody bet an eye lol
  they should not discriminate if theyre taking money    discriminate is not really the right word for picking cosplays that interest you if a photographer refuses to shoot with cosplayers of a certain race/build no matter how great they look yeah thats a problem but its not whats being discussed in this reply thread accepting payment does not mean that a photographer absolutely must shoot with you if you apply thats like saying an artist absolutely must draw your commission when you ask them to     nobody has to take your money make a better cosplay and youll be more appealing to photographers
  does better cosplay mean thin asian girl we see thorough your shit
  if you want to call out a racist photographer nice blackout btw just do it you dont need to hijack an unrelated discussion about posting and choosing shoot requests because then you just sound like you cant read
    point flew over anons head did you even read over what you wrote
  yes yes we know you really want to talk about how all the famous photographers are racist however the original poster was asking about only shooting characters/cosplays that i am familiar with and how to turn down other applicants try reading again
  so true every single male photographer in the katsucon fb group
no idea where the conversation got confused but there shouldnt be anything wrong with rejecting applicants if they dont have a costume youre comfortable shooting just be honest people will inevitably get upset if they feel like you dont represent things like plus size and poc cosplayers but in the end its your own damn business and you can do and charge and shoot whatever the hell you want you dont owe anyone anything    in relation to katsu im noticing a huge jump in prices in the photog posts that have been coming up 50100 for 8 shitty dlsr shots what the fuck is going on ive never seen con photogs charge as much as katsu photogs do i realize theyre trying to scam up the price of the badges they originally hadnt planned on buying but this is getting ridiculous
  why the fuck would you shoot paying uggos and fatties when you could shoot paying hot cosers
  hot cosers dont want to pay because theyre all sluts that want shit for free
  so im guessing no one wanted to book you huh  its basic economics buddy these photogs only go to katsu if they break even from photoshoots if they reject all uggos and fatties and only shoot with hot cosplayers theyre obviously being paid enough by said hot cosplayers if not theyd accept bookings from the uggos
  8 dslr shots for 100 is cheap look outside a con and you can find shoots on average of 250450 for regular shoots more if rentals are involved
  ops portfolio isnt even diverse on her instagram you have to go all the way to last year to see a single poc talk about pot calling the kettle black
  i hope this pushes through id like to see a tanacon 20
  thats going to be hilarious doesnt the mgm not like cosplayers going in there already
  no shit its more expensive outside a con you have to make up for travel and time off and any other expenses with cons the average is lower because people are already spending a fuckton just getting there so photogs tend to charge less so they can book more these people just shouldnt be charging 100 for shots that look like they were taken by a five year old who was just handed a disposable camera if im dropping money on a photog i want nice shots
  100 for shots that look like they were taken by a five year old   post examples very curious to see if these people actually get bookings
  its an active casino pretty sure theyll frown on cosplayers showing up with props for photos
  surprisingly the number of photographers charging over 75 is rarer than i thought or theyre buried beneath tons of posts heres a quick collage of photos from different photographers charging 75 and over i removed their watermarks to prevent any biases and am just going by their rate of money charged not counting number of edits or time of shoot into it
  i mean some of these are of questionable quality like the top 2 and bottom middle and maybe the bottom right but the others look quite nice and i can definitely see them being fully booked this con
  suprised you left out lou lou 100 and amie 195 their ads are still up in the facebook groups i see your bias there 
  say what you want about athel delivering subpar photos to uggos but the photos he used in his ad are lit i instantly recognized which one in the collage is his
give me recs on attractive photogs /gulls/
  i didnt see theres at the time of browsing just saw the ones i saw advertising and jumped over to their pages to find a larger res pic of something that looked to be from a paid shoot and not a hall shot specially if they used as a profile or cover photo for their page and tried to avoid a photo from their ads since photogs always choose the best for ads but if nothing else was present then a larger pic from their ad
  amie has a pic in that collage if you cant tell which ones is hers then editor choose a good pic she doesnt push a lot to show her skill
  too bad youre probably not going to get a photo like you see in the ad athel is decent when he gives a shit which is such a small fraction of the time that it doesnt even matter
  i charge a tiny fee for flakes and because it keeps me revenue neutral wrt cons for 100 thats a damn lot
  athels photos with sam are so good though which is weird because sam isnt even asian but i agree hes usually hit or miss with randos
  i used to occasionally get small tips after a shoot but i started charging a small fee because people kept wasting my time and flaking by not showing up for shoots at cons one of those sits where it was like lets shoot and theyre like okay but then day of theyre running late no shows or are too drunk    as time passed i started charging more due to longer shoots and longer editing times as i started learning programs plus i started valuing my editing time    i laugh when i see some of these photographers charging 30 for a one hour shoot with 12 edits im assuming theyre editing is minimal at best but just time wise and number of photos theyre not going to even make minimum wage at the end of the shoot for the hour    its like asking someone to commission a cosplay but then only paying for the cost of shipping and materials
  for me i dont need the money i make more by breathing at work than everyone but the 100 dollar an hour guys jesus christ you are like union new crane worker wages but you said it the small fee somehow a increased my customer base which is awesome and b eliminated 95 of flakes i may bump it up in 2 years once minimum wage averages 12 an hour nationwide since the goal is more show up on time please my convention time is be professional and after hours its charging time have a few drinks and honestly i do all my experimental shoots at night when i have 0 pressure so i can do fun things    if i was to charge minimum wage i would have to unironically charge 50 and now 60 thanks to the minimum wage bump and because i feel bad about this you are pretty much dead on the basic rate i feel you should start for free but charge for everyone unless you know they wont flake on you
  longer shoots longer editing times learning programs   started valuing my editing time  i make okay money at my job so i dont really need the extra  but i feel like this is really starting to apply to me as most of my free time is seemingly spent editing its legitimately starting to feel like an awful drain and source of stress vs this fun new world to explore and experiment in when i first started out   i also feel like a lot of people are only booking with me simply because im a free photog they want free pics but dont actuslly care for my editing style id love to be a bit more picky but looking at how people in this thread are reacting to photogs being picky and choosy i feel like my choices are limited to working with people/cosplays that im not too excited about and being miserable working in post for 2957392 hours on shots i dont even like or actually working with cosplayers that im excited to work with but risk being called out or shunned for whatever reason
  is the middle left photo by amie thats the only one that can remotely pass for a photo from her and the color/contract just do not match her style anon you had me stumped
  id guess middle right because of the fucked saturation
    i actually thought it was the bottom right photo the random color splash s one of her signature aesthetics
  middle right is maddi may/ratling shes a fashion photographer that started doing cosplay photography at katsu last year if i remember correctly
  which one is it anon
        i think its the one on the upper left
  thats ame photography without an i similarly named but otherwise unrelated
i dont attend katsu but i love this new badge policy freeloaders can fuck off
    no one gives a fuck if youre free anon if you dont charge shoot what you want the people that are being complained about charge
    what anon said nobody gives a shit who you shoot if youre free    thats unless youre good then youre an elitist jelly people be jelly just ignore them
  even if you charge you can shoot what you want you just miss out on uggo dollars
anyone shot with chezphoto before she just started a giveaway and 20 minutes for 200 seem very steep her photos are very nice though
  ive shot with her a few times she does great work and is very professional i usually hate how i look in photos but she can consistently take photos of me i actually like not just ones dont hate thats worth the price for me personally but i also have more disposable income than a lot of cosplayers ill probably have her shoot my next project when its finished     there are certain subjects/series she seems more excited about shooting than others i dont cosplay from her favorite genre of costuming for example but i wouldnt not recommend her based on that if you do really detailed cosplays shes very good at capturing that kind of work
  200 for 5 photos is more than i would pay in my current situation but if i had money i would i think her work speaks for itself
  i agree with other anons chez is about the same price as amie but her posing and editing is superb plus no ugly saturation and contrast like amie
  is the middle bottom shinakophotos her photos are trash and i suspect she might be mentally challenged didnt realize she charges 75 good luck
happy change of pace whats your cosplay line up for katsu
  i really like the very center and bottom left also interested in top left and middle right who are the photographers for each
  definitely her but shes only charging 25 for 30 minutes according to her insta nowhere near 75
i feel like the laughable part is photogs setting time at 30 minutes or less thats a sure sign that youll end up with a handful of mediocre photos and maybe one good one
  if you know what youre doing and its a solo shot you absolutely dont need more than thirty minutes to produce three or so good photos shooting more than one cosplayer is a different story
  it might be enough to get a good photo from a photographers point of view but it definitely isnt from a cosplayers point of view adjusting little things like pose to make the photo look more dynamic face angle wig costume etc takes much longer than that
  just because youre not very good doesnt mean others cant produce good photos under 30 minutes chezphotos charges 200 per 20 minutes and she has long line of repeated customers git gud
  im a cosplayer and a decent photographer if both your subject and your photog are good it is absolutely possible to get a great shot in thirty minutes unless your subject is especially bad at posing
  one great shot is doable but five doubtful most of these people who are paying for photogs suck at posing as well
  read the thread retard a technically good photoa photo that shows the cosplayer and costume in the best possible way
  people would pay 200/20 mins for photos that dont show the cosplayer and costume in the possible way    let me guess you also fuck around with the focus ring for minutes to get the focus in focus
  no im a cosplayer who gets free shoots with these same photogs that charge 100 for 30 mins because im popular and cute our shoots are almost always at least 1 hour  i just know the amount of time that it takes to get the perfect photo and 30 min wont cut it stop selfposting and taking things so personally
  different anon but i am also a cosplayer who gets free shots with these same photographers because i am well known and make detailed cosplays i actually dislike when my shoots run an hour just for a solo run because i need very little direction and that means i am spending most of my time waiting around for the photog to adjust settings some of my favorite shots are from shoots that lasted 1520 minutes 30 is not a guarantee the photographer is bad
  i didnt say that the photographer was bad i said you wouldnt get 5 amazing shots 30 is a guarantee that youll get at most 2 great shots and the rest will be mediocre even if the photo is technically good in terms of photography please read before replying to a thread
  kek you sound like someone who only takes glamour shots in the same pose for every costume
    my friend dan seiter always take his time instead of doing the same poses for every cosplayer he experiment with different camera angles and poses
  and you should stop being so assrashed that someone has a different opinion than you 30 is a guarantee that youll get at most 2 great shots is an opinion or your personal experience not a fact
  pointing out that 30 min isnt enough time to get a bunch of amazing shots  wahh youre butthurt  wahhh youre just upset that you cant take great photos  stop getting defensive chez no one was calling you out directly in the first place
georgia cosplayer here ive always wanted to go to katsucon because ive heard the cosplay scene there is toptier however i have a hard time justifying traveling so far for a 3day con in your opinion is it worth a 95hour drive plus badge and hotel costs
i am going to rhrow myself to the lions i made this coord for a holiday meetup the style i was going for is otome it over knee length and i got inspiration from a otome sewing book i want to wear it with velvet red slippers and white knee socks with matching bow headpiece i am open for comment critisism ridicule whatever im ok with it fyi my first coord
get rid of the weird random gingham and tartan parts the red bows too the lace doesnt look great maybe switch to cotton crochet the waist is awkward and is going to make you look large just have a normal waist   if you need extra fabric to replace the gingham on the chest and random scallops/ruffle on the bottom match it to a subdued no red color in the print like light blue or grey  lastly wear it with tights a beret or some sort of wool/felt hat if you dont then a simple flat headbow
not sure how much you can alter it at this point but ill still tell you the changes that imo would make this look better      the waist tie doesnt look good and spoils the silhoutte id remove it   the two different tartan/gingham patterns are a bit too much especially since theyre green and blue two colours that usually dont go well together id remove the last blue gingham frill but then you would have a blue gingham bodice and a green tartan hem not sure how to go about this to be honest maybe you could add a green tartan waist strip small that you could tie in a ribbon on the front that way the green hem would look better coordinated and not randomly put there   im not a fan of the lace you used it doesnt look too bad on the hem but on the bodice i would have gone for something heavier like a 100 cotton lace right now its a little transparent and it looks weird    i really like the bows although maybe they are a little too many or too big i would have gone for two smaller bows on front and one on the bodice
this looks terrible just throw the whole thing in the trash
  ohhh honey no you probably worked hard on this but its honestly bad and id say just wear it at home as pajamas   the over embellishment in weird contrasting patterns is ita   you could possibly try a simple jsk with the all over christmas print instead   take a look at what leur getter does for and idea of what works what you made definitely doesnt fit into the aesthetic  work hard
  when you match fabrics you have to think about style too not just color the gingham doesnt match the tartan and neither match the deer fabric the lace looks thin and sad in general it can be hard to find good lace id look on aliexpress or etsy the design is a little too fussy for what i associate with otome and comes off as lolita but with a small skirt look at emily temple cute designs to get a better idea of otome think about just showing off the print and adding a few details like lace on the hem of the skirt and bodice the construction doesnt look terrible so the good news is you can sew i might use that fabric for a just skirt if you want to rip everything apart and its not a bad idea to add red as an accent but id just do accessories
if youre gonna use the tiny bow chain thing on the bodice pin it on symetrically on both of the straps cause now it just looks kinda random  thats also not how scallops are made next time cut out your scallops on the bottom of your dress and cut out an identical row of scallops from another piece of fabric sew them together score the edges and flip over to the right side and iron that way they look much more neat and clean  also if youre gonna ask for advice do it before you assemble the entire thing that way you can you know still make some actual changes im sure your next piece is gonna be better
your main mistake was not to go simple thats the first thing you should do when you start sewing lolita simple simple simple       take a look at what leur getter does for and idea of what works     this you can sew go simple and the result will be good
if youve never worn otome before then youll have a poor grasp of what fabrics lace trims pattern motifs dress patterns etc are suitable for the style why not just buy a 40 secondhand taobao jsk from lacemarket for your first dress
oh honey no the deer fabric is so cute you probably wouldve done just fine if you had stuck to that exclusively you could still have had red accents like bows to bring out the little red from the cardinal maybe even the blue gingham was fine but the red and green clash too much    the lace is low quality too and brings it down if the bow are made from scratch then youve done a great job on them they are even and clean your hemming is straight too which is great i think you have the technical skills to pull off a cute dress but definitely lacking in the design skills department    go to lacestaobaocom for nice lace even with shipping its still very affordable as it is about a dollar per yard for most of them and do research  just look through past otome releases and tags on social media
  okay you seem new as evidenced by the   1 whole thread for your idiocy  2 name field  dont do either of those things kohai
  wow i didnt know robert downey jr was into otome
  just keep the deer fabric remove everything else
  oh fuck what is happening
  i think as per usual cgl is being retardedly harsh i know you said you wanted this but i seriously doubt all the conflicting bullshit is actually going to give you a clear picture of what to actually do with the dress
  get rid of the green fabric period the red bows also need to go the 3 lace from walmart needs to be chucked away too  you can get decent looking lace for cheap off aliexpress by just typing in lace ribbon if you really want to keep the red you need a darker shade of red by just a bit but blue matching the dress would look better if you ditch the red brown shoes would look cute do tights and maybe a cute white sweater    your construction is good just need to up grade your fabric choices and lace
this thread is a lot nicer than i was expecting after seeing op seagulls critique can often be brutal past the point of being constructive   i hate to say this but the best thing i an recommend is starting over with a simpler design to build basic sewing skills i also recommend studying your favorite brands to see how they employ contrasting fabric to get a better idea of whats appropriate and what isnt lastly i recommend using the existing handmade thread instead of starting a whole new one   good luck op
  i have a feeling op is long gone and perhaps they didnt even make this dress and they pulled the pic from elsewhere
  nitpick
  she just needs different shoes and wig
  most of the coords here are fine but whoever took the photo needs to be shot
  the coords are fine but the girls just have really unfortunate faces
  are you serious shes like a mall goth reject
      front center needs a bra tho
  oops meant to tag  not 
feedback photos on aliexpress
  grandma ita style
    hi hi olive oylchan again this was only posted to my personal fb as a derp no one was ready for this photo lol type thing we took another photo where we were prepared it was taken by one of the girls bfs fun meet though regardless
  im curious about the good photo  care to post it
    i guess since were already here lmao of all photos anon chose the derp one lol im laughing heres one where we actually were smiling it was a good day
  you look so cute back there olive oylchan way to go
  aside from some bad hair choices and far right needing a petti they dont look terrible
  almost all of the coords are halfway cut off what a shitty photo
    thank you i still have to work on those eye bags though definitely didnt help i had less than four hours sleep the night before ill get there one day
    ah we didnt plan a group coord shot it isnt the best photo i admit but it was just posted to my personal fb as a thank you for being such great people thats a good idea though thank you ill remember for next time to do a group coord shot
  im glad you had a good time next time tell the bf to get every coord i regret every time i put together a coord and have no pictures of it
    oh yes we did take some individual coord shots on our own phones the met has some stunning backdrops theres a really beautiful christmas tree where the heavenly bodies exhibit used to be took some photos there
i fucking cackled  same pose and almost same colors
  sigh  too bad the coord itself is nice  or am i missing something im still no good at spotting replicas except bags but thats easy
  the pose is bad doesnt flatter at all
  its also not flattering that its a man
  and she needs a new blouse and headwear that isnt cheerleader bows by the time you get rid of all that the only ok stuff is the jsk and plain tights
  the coord is fine he cant help his face
  where can i buy this
  the ouji looks good
  needs to makeup and learn better angles then
  the ny comm looks like they have down syndrome
  thats the ny comm not the actual one
    actually this isnt any comm even though we are in the main comm was a private meet yes simply was there but she was quiet for once after we spoke to her beforehand
  where is her body
  fuck cannot unsee
  mr toads wild ride
  muh kawaii tshirt
  neko neko no
  why are the ugly ones at the front the majority in the back row look at least halfdecent
  the dress looks like cheap taobao and from what i can see it looks like theres a lack of makeup
    we did the whole shortest to tallest order everyone was really sweet though
  why do you keep checking this thread and replying to everyone its not doing you any favors
  newfag
  i would rather see her standing than sittinghere she looks shapeless can anyone find one of her standing not that shes not large
  she looks like the witch of the wastes from howls moving castle
this was posted without any comment so it might not be intended as lolita but whatever it is its ita
  oliveoyl chan taking crit is one thing her defending the others is another
  i love it when theres all kinds of shit in the background its like taking a peak into some itas life
just a general ita question but why is it that every dumb ass instagram mua type loves galaxy themed shit i noticed this recently that all the galaxy themed coords i see are instathots trying to get into lolita
  posting lor is cheating
  it took me way too long to realize that shes not in a wheelchair
    these ones arent too bad
pls no concrit
 ddlg collar   pregnant
  she looks like her glasses are holding her hostage
  show the whole coord otherwise this is a vendetta post
  vendetta post  youre retarded arent you
  but since you insist cuntchan 
  perfect description
  tell front fatty left middle to not show up braless
if you just look at the background this is fine
  when your cankles go all the way up to your chin chankles
  glad im not the only one who relled my eyes at that comment   dunt hurt muh feefees
  is that a sad heart apron replica because ouch    that wig is a sin
bad fit awkward layers sad petticoat those socks and wtf is wrong with her bonnet
      fucking savage
    when efame doesnt mean you have taste
  undergarments are the foundation when will these ham chans learn
  ouch this somehow looks worse
  just because you can pull the lacing tighter doesnt mean you should this just looks painful
  is there any particular reason lors gone down ita lane that whole my lolita fashion history video was garbage she was wearing the most godawful wig she seems really bad with wigs and shes just gone downhill from there
  she never has nice poof where is the shape and her lacing is much too tight shes not a ham or anything so what the fuck this is just shameful and lazy
  that over bite makes her look like a 12 year old
what is that thing on the right
  lovely classic baby dress shoehorned with trendy bullshit cluster fuck
  you must really hate yourself to self post this shit
  honestly i dont think shes ever was the best coorder her best outfits have been the ones that follow the guidelines of lolita and i think shes in the stage where she wants to experiment but this aint it like also in her video she said she was originally going to wear something else and she should have gone with her original option instead of trying to where something she didnt have anything packed for
  what the actual fucking fuck
  nit pick     not great but not ita
  the belly makes me smile with a real hair accessory and cute necklace shed be a cute noob
  are you dense its not a self post they posted it in response to the other anon crying vendetta
  kate is also really shitty when it comes to wigs but gulls love to slobber all over her cock regardless
  its a bodyline jsk with a bodyline maid apron over it
  youre retarded arent you  guess i was right the first time kek
  the only people who slobber over her imagination ego dick is herself the rest of the gulls here love to point out what a dumb cunt she is
it was deleted in record time by the poster but fucking /r/lolita some thot who posts in /r/ddlg and /r/realahego that probably thought shed get asspats and then just got like two comments about needing to see the rest of the outfit to know if lolita or not
  sad because shes actually cute
  she is cute for sure it was just kinda special to have a reddit account full of you making really dumb faces for attention
  now im curious about what she actually wrote
    r/lolita is kind of weird half the content seems to be posted by weirdoes and itas and this kind of lost redditor and for some reason all of the homemade sucks like im not even sure if people just cant sew or cant be arsed to post to r/lolita instead of r/sewing but then the comments show that some of the commentors at least know their shit then the rest of the time its pretty dead like thered be a video once in a blue moon and then the rest of the time nobody posts    its certainly interesting if you want to see the occasional ita though i guess
  is she wearing a hanbok
  mfw some of those informed comments might have been mine   oh come on i know im not the only gull that goes there
  im pretty sure thats her own hair
  most of the back row looks fine except the girl on the right  the ouji is a nitpick but the rest of the first rowyikes  some of them look fine clothingwise but have really unfortunate faces need to get some contacts and fix their hair and makeup/wig styling  but its hard to tell because this is an awful shot and only a few of them look like they were actually prepared and posing for the photo
  whoa i didnt even recognize you olive oylchan
  doing her any favors for what chill shes just answering questions
  this was literally just posted how more newfag can you get
  stop shitting up the thread with reposts of the same images
  am i the only one who thinks this looks alright nitpick sure for the painfully tight fit and that weird shawl thing she should have more petti but as it stands i dont think its the worst thing ever
  if this is what the nyc comm has been reduced to im glad i moved out of the country
  i agree its nitpick especially when you compare it to the rest of the thread im calling vendetta
    well i did answer this before but this was a photo posted to my personal fb where we laughed at how none of us were prepared and i briefly joked about how it looked like i had no soul i posted the photo where we were prepared later in the thread
  she doesnt seem to be a noob because she has ap you guys sadly could not wear any of her ap but she definitely has some and thats what posting on cof is all about not about a well lit full shot of your coord
  babbys first lolita dress
  lol guys this was the rpa fashion show look its not her dress or styling
what is the worst ita in a chinese brand that youve seen
  thats at the tea party
  nice vendetta post she looks fine
  post in stupid questions jfashion newfag
  lol nope nayrt but it clearly doesnt belong there
nooooooooooo
  we disected her pretty bad in last ita thread
  looks scary as if she would suck someones soul through her camera
  maybe ill look more lolita holding a doll  is this bitch really trying to pass off a scrunchie and a forever 21 cardigan as lolita
  stop posting this 3 threads in a row its annoying quit shitting up the thread with stuff weve already seen
  the ny comm is so recognisable becouse of some of the most unfortunate faces i saw in lolita but they seem nice and in this pic i can spot only one fattychan badbra ita
  this is no ita i do not like the bonnet and that long cardigan but with an oldschool headdress or smaller bonnet would look nice
  bro is this going to end up in every ita thread its been in the past two
  nayrt but she like actually states in a video that she was dressed up for a fashion show in that coord and that was one of the pictures used to show it
  i love lor but i hate this coord shes very experimental right now and sometimes it just doesnt work at least her makeup is starting to get better
  this must be you you dont need to see the shoes to know that this is ita the only okay thing here is the dress everything else is awful
  nothing matches here not a single thing    and im no epert but im pretty sure that furs a coat collar for when your fur coat doesnt cover your neck completely and its cold/snowing/whatnot     i really hope she gets better and puts on a better petticoat
    really fuck i need to lurk more
  looks like her so
  no you dont s
  i know she was trying to go for an african theme but holy shit this isnt cohesive at all those gloves match nothing the hat matches nothing the blouse is soo bulky and that even is on the skirt theres ways to include culture without looking horrendously uncoordinated im sorry that other black girls have no grasp on colors and blending them
  im not her but your vendetta against her is tiresome get over it
  then youre one of her white knighting friends im not who posted her anyway but i agree she looks like trash
  yay olive oylchan i love you and your great attitude that first picture is so hilariously bad mostly because everyone is not ready im glad you had a fun ild
  this could be a normie ethnic inspired outfit but sure not lolita
  i was going to post this lol
even if they are burando i can not miss the lacemonster vibe they have
  jesus she looks like purple aki in drag
  the fur is a coat collar  nah thats a mink stole probably vintage
  what call the police      but for real i really like the braidception
  this doesnt belong in the ita thread
  maybe hes measuring poof now and not muscles     i honestly assumed that no one on here would get the reference
  its always the newfriends with the worst attitudes who never know what theyre talking about
  with gloves in a different material this could be the base of a really good dolly kei outfit the construction of the skirt isnt suitable for lolita though shes quite pretty and i love the creativity here
  woa i 100 love this maybe not lolita but she looks like out of a dream
  considering it wasnt a repost   nah
  you sound like you have some major newfag issues and im not even ayrt
  terrible
  nitpick
  are you joking pls tell me your joking
  also nitpick wish she would do something with her hair or something and get some actual lolita shoes 
  really tired of everyone thinking a collar is related to ddlg while i get that its super popular for kinksters some people really just like collars they have been worn as fashion accessories for as long as i have been alive and i was born in the 80s so im sure they were popular before hand and not in a kink way as well
      nitpicks
  this isnt lolita and i i wouldnt call it ouji either its interesting though i think the cheapo camisole and shoes really bring it down though some cool boots would really help
  either way they dont belong in lolita
  was posted to cof as ouji
  dear lord girl posture no outfit is ever going to look good on you if you keep standing like a sack of potatoes
  beside the cat ears nothing bothers me
  the ctp set includes a collar
  thats not a leather/ vegan leather collar with padlocks or chains two completely different things
  but she actually is one
  if she would have balanced the colors better this wouldnt have been too bad    the coord in itself doesnt look too bad aside from the shoes but that fit though how did she even get the blazer to button up over her bust that cant be comfortable at all    i actually like this but i wouldnt label it as lolita    seems like babbys first coord desu its not bad at all just needs more fitting socks and shoes and a bit more tweaking on the color balance    this outfit aint too bad either also seems like a beginner attempting the fashion i think the lighting and background dont do her any favors and the posture doesnt either i also would replace the cat ears but the rest of the outfit is decent
  thats fine and is valid and something i forgot to add but its super annoying always seeing people calling any collar a ddlg collar punk lolita looks fine in collars    and to be fair most cheapo heart collars are worn by wannabe littles and other cringe but not all collars are
  shit this is one of the ugliest lolita dresses i have ever seen looks like she wanted to be all fancy but had to go thrift shopping for a mumu because she spent all her money on a bonnet
  i think this looks fine for an outfit but its definitely not lolita i dont know wtf she was thinking posting this on a lolita group come on now
  are you ignoring the piss yellow hair or
  what is a mumu never heard this word
  is this the same girl from above  yeeyks
  see woman in the middle muumuu is a big printed sack dress that fat old ladies in the us usually wear but its colloquially used to mean a shapeless bag of a dress
  newfag  uh the newfag would be the one posting the same scary uggo to every single thread thanks for playing tho
  wanna try posting an outfit since this is the ita thread laughing at cringy looking people is fun and all but this thread has a purpose and making fun of faces can be seen as vendetta and that can get our thread nuked
  the tank top is killing me but the concept is pretty cool otherwise
  i think this is fun but not really lolita the most ita part is the horrible makeup but i am probably biased because i like creepy/bloody outfits
  its maybe not a full on catastrophe but she makes brank look really cheap and frumpy and just does not look good
  lolwut this makeup is a trainwreck that emphasizes her weird features but unfortunately its a trendy trainwreck that every other lolita seems to want to try
  this has nothing whatsoever to do with lolita what was she thinking
  you sound like a vendetta chan even more now desu i dont even know who the fuck is but she doesnt look like trash  is it a perfect coord nah but the issues are nitpicks shes a far cry from the no blouse no petti sneakers and normie kneehigh socks with a kink collar party city wig and no makeup itas that actually belong here
    are you a newfriend blind or do you just not have any standards
  what planet are you from did your species not evolve eyes
  stop wearing sneakers with lolita  i dont care how cute or girly they are i dont care how casual the outfit is theyre not lolita and never will be save the pastel sneakers for fairy kei  theres plenty of loliable shoes that are comfortable get a throwback pair of bodyline shoes for your casual days
  hon when people say ita bag this is not what they mean
  needs shoes but this is great
  needs a different blouse and other shoes it has a little bit of theater costume feeling and i am not sure if is lolita
  ugh these people should be put in prison that shit is disgusting my little age is 5 only fucking pedos want to fuck children     /rant
  is this a lolita attempt at negan from twd 
  1 where to buy
  she looks like the dog who ate the bee lmao
  but why
  nitpick
  and shes pregnant lawd help that child
          nitpicks nothing here offends my eyes anons be getting lazy         literally 2 seconds on google but then that one anon wouldnt get to be a salty cunt about old people  
    fucking hell why do gulls need to be spoonfed  its the third result for reverse image search
  thats fine and is valid  it really really isnt
  the hands in the corner get me  but needs better resolution to really allow us to discern who is good and bad here
  i once heard someone tell a story about how their friends parents were into some ddlg type kink and it probably fucked their friend up for life so yeah
  um this looks pretty cool
  the hat is bad but thats a nitpick i like sandals and tights/ socks in summer coords
  ugh i feel bad for her future kid degenerates like her shouldnt be allowed to breed
  lol its unknown a how the hell did she think her coords are better than bunbunroyalty i will never know oh vermont
  is this a very tiny girl in a huge dress
  the biggest thing that gets me here is that she has a scarf heavy jacket and ear muffs on but her fucking legs are bare and she has sheer socks on for christs sake
  i love this as a normie fashion look t b h
love niki is such as a tough set to wear this is not good
  nitpick i think it looks fine there is nothing its about it    stupid pose but also nitpick looks like an ok coord
  ita stupid autocorrect     not lolita but i low key love this
  no i think our old aquaintance the neko furry lolita wasnt actually ita at all
   you posted someones low quality comm pic of course every comm has its itas but you can barely see this why bother
  why do i get the impression that theres a man under this
  disgusting
  i was counting down till that star underskirt started showing up here
  not the girl there but thanks for playing
  nyart but i think the second one is just a reaction image
  its a shame this would be great if she had a proper dress shes very pretty
  gold winged gladiator sandals would make this a better outfit       it could look good in a punk coord but youd have to be careful about how you do it
  that dress is just not good i hate it thanks
  the fact that his chest looks like a cardboard box    yikes
  its literally the second pic ass hat
  when you dont own any lolita but you already ita   kek
  the dress is probably the only cute thing she bought and how the fuck did she manage to spend that much
  ddlg vibes
    the dress sets a clusterfuck but she did herself no favours stuffing herself into it when it doesnt really fit her right either    the waistline should hit her at her waist but not only does it hit her at her underbust you can even see where the white part ends which tells you she stretched out the back of the dress way too much    the lack of poof and that horrible blouse seriously it just highlights her arm fat are nitpicks but they do make an ill fitting dress look even worse
  lmao its just a reaction pic stupid
  her headdress looks like a cake
stop spamming the ita threads with good coords like this one edition    ill go with  ivory and white dont match  fishnets look a bit tacky
  fishnets would look less tacky if the shoes were contrasting like white whats weird is there is white lace sewn onto what i would say is a cream top the skirt looks more ivory then white to me
what are those
  this looks good        theyre just ugly
  any picks of lor in that pink taobao dress yet
its been a long time since ive seen a nitpick thread these tend to be much more productive than the ita thread so ill share some thoughts i dont mind this coordinate but i think the socks are white which wouldnt match the ivory blouse the wig should also be swapped or styled better i like the bonnet
  ive been waiting for those lmao havent seen them yet     but correction i think it was lavender but i know the one youre referring too
  she hot thooooo
  white fishnets are really cute imo and would work in this coord help balance the bottom half and then a cream bag shoes or rectangle headress maybe to match the blouse
  how does this girl have thousands of followers when she barely posts and her posts arent that special
  shes attractive did you really need to ask
  she had a huge twitter following a few years ago for being a snarky underage thot who would tell boys to fuck off while pandering hard to them shes a huge attention whore      shes very normallooking bordering on ugly without makeup though
  nitpicking is so unnecessary and encourages perfectionists and elitists
  ohhh this is clearly left over butthurt from the ita thread   10034587
  
  if it were not for lor it would end in the ita thread those tights and the makeup makes it ugly
  lolita needs elitism
  goth girl and /r9k/ pandering get you orbiters
  i thought she was a twitter thot did she selfpost on r9k or did she just gather beta orbiters by existing   also lesbian   dating a tran
  yeah this was for the oni con tea party the coord looked a lot better in person desu the girl on the left is the designer of the dresses theyre wearing
  girl
  why why why does lor insist on wearing makeup styles that do not suit her face but really tho those shoes no  also i love the rpa designer shes so sweet 3
  looks like she smells   i dont like her either but wow thats unnecessary did she piss in your cornflakes or something
attention whore  mediocre coords  dyke     can people stop kissing this girls ass
  you say dyke like thats a bad thing in the lolita community  personally im more grossed out by  cis lesbian  hates bisexuals   troon girlfriend    is she even in a comm
  she looks like every edgy alt stoner girl that reeks of weed and bo out of lolita
  just by existing i think a lot of robots are on twitter
can you all leave emma alone please she has no drama shes just a cute goth girl who trendhops but is nice and chill and shes probably leaving lolita soon anyway
  back to /r9k/ you go
  hi emmas gf
      gulls i didnt even know this girl was efamous can you focus on nitpicking coords and stop attacking this one girl just because shes doing whatever shes doing online
  im butthurt because people have been spamming ita threads with decent coords lately not because this particular person got posted
  shes not efamous i dobt understand where this all came from      ew never       im not her gf i just think shes cute and nice and has good clothing taste
  id be cool with this if the blouse were more structured/not basically yellow  theres ivory/cream and theres that the skirt doesnt necessarily look snowy white eitheri disagree with  i think the tights/shoes are fine i also think stark white should look weird    trend hopper  unironically unforgivable she also looks the same in all three photos      those tights would look bad even if they were cream either something solid or something with a more delicate pattern would look better    lor belongs in the ita thread lets be real here she needs to completely start over
  only the wig is truly bad coord is okay otherwise    those dresses are absolutely ita trash and lors shoes and fishnets just make it worse hideous ita coords
  sure
  wasnt lor dressed like this for the fashion show im assuming she didnt style herself
  models usually provide their own shoes
  no she wasnt in the fashion show this is from the tea
thank god this thread is dying
  why
  bumps it anyway
  i used sage but didnt announce it but a lot of good that did next time ill just troll the thread until deletion
there hasnt been one of these in a good while send me your worst
anybody going to lucca comics this year it has just started
  good
  i come on this board only on lucca days to see if theres some sort of drama and its boring how every year theres no drama  guess italian losers stick to fb and twitter
just came back it was ok had a good time
  10/10
  die
cringe
last one
  dio te maledica te do uno sciafon che te impituro su pal muro to madre putana che te copo dio can
it was a lovely event i really had fun its very sad that although this is one of the biggest conventions in the world maybe even the second biggest after tokyos comiket not many people know it outside of italy also shame on you anon who only posted bad cosplay and stolen pics ti diverti male pisano di merda
i will be going as nelly virsaladze from saki
how do you guys go about this especially people who are already shy what do you do to
honestly if youre shy the easiest way is for you to just go in a decent cosplay or jfash and people will come up to you instead just approach people wearing a cosplay you know something about and compliment them talk about the show etc but recognise when people are putting out signs that they dont want to talk to you its usually obvious unless youre completely socially inept if this is you then youll need advice for social situations generally and not off 4chan dont approach girls dressed in jfashion unless youre also a girl its too easy to be misread as a creep
  dont approach girls  ftfy
i like dancing so what i do is ill find one of those assholes blasting music on a speaker and boogie down with them if theyre playing some jams and act goofy as fuck and make other attendees laugh and eventually someone will strike up a conversation or heckle me and then boom made a pal for the weekend
another how do i talk to girls thread  stupid
when youre a literal alpha male and you just talk to people about what theyre reading or wearing ar conventions    buncha spergs
  1 collect underpants  2 cosplay your favourite series  3   4 profit
dress up as a cylon or a storm trooper  hover around people and make stupid sound effects
youre best bet is to have a good cosplay or a silly one if youre brave enough   i find its easier to be approached than approach people if youre really shy i can assure you that lots of weebs out there love to talk and be talked to and like the other anon said if they dont show interest in you then move on to someone else   if you are adamant about being the one to approach people the best thing to do is approach someone who is dressed in a cosplay that you recognize asking them for a pic how they made ithow much time it took etc or go to a meet up youre interested and try to mingle it also doesnt hurt to talk about the con itself  another one that has really helped me brake the ice is to pass out items like packaged small treats/stickers/pins/ribbons at cons its a super easy way to have conversations with people and it makes peoples day ive had lots of fun giving/receiving small gifts like at a pokemon meetup a girl gave me a pokemon card she was achingly awkward but very sweet and funny ive also had a person dressed in the same cosplay as me come and start talking to me take a pic and gave me some packaged jelly beans ive also seen cosplayers use cute props for people to take pics with when they approach them its a lot of fun and helps break the anxiousness you might feel  dunno if that helps but there ya go
  im super shy but ill approach people cosplaying the same series as me because obviously we have that in common ill also be more receptive to people talking to me if theyre in cosplay from the same series most of my con friends whom ive met and stayed in contact with are people i met while cosplaying the same series   pro tip though pay attention to the person and what they are doing before you approach i was recently at a con just sitting on my phone i was taking a break and didnt really want to socialize this guy comes up and starts talking to me and i didnt want to be rude but i didnt really feel like talking to him about what anime i watch if someone is on their phone or seems occupied its probably best to just ask for a pic and leave if you want one or not approach them expecting to have a conversation
  men constantly ask how do i talk to girls like absolute retards  women live outside the same reality  ok
  what are you on about
dont let this thread turn into shit op never even mentioned girls      what if you do want to socialize but are alone i know you can wander around dealers/aa but otherwise it seems hard to signal that you are open to conversation
  if someone is walking around the con hanging out in the lobby in cosplay just generally hanging out they are probably more open to socializing its more the lack of reading of signals that say i dont want to talk to people right now that socially awkward people seem to miss if someone is sitting to the side on their phone eating or talking to someone they probably dont want to socialize right then
  from the perspective of wanting to be approached for conversation i feel like its awkward to hang out alone just standing around in cosplay and not on my phone is that just an issue on my part it doesnt help that ive peoplewatched with con friends and i feel kind of bad seeing some people standing in cosplay alone for 10 minutes with nobody interacting with them i do ask for photos sometimes if i notice people like that but im not a good conversation initiator to do anything else
    would you find it weird to talk to someone after youre asked for a photo and taken said photo
  not them but no especially if you talk to me about the series im cosplaying
  not really its nice to get to know other fans
  no those are my favorite kind of interactions desu its also a good excuse to swap social media
    huh good to know i was always under the impression that the etiquette was to ask for the picture and when you were done you left god i wish my iphone wasnt shitting itself or i would be able to use snapchat on it rather than my huge tablet
  you can talk to them after taking a picture but notice social cues also if you interrupted them doing something probably leave them be ive been asked for pictures while eating or talking to people and im fine with taking a quick picture but im not going to want to chat if theyre just hanging out thats fine but also be aware that they will probably get asked for pics and your convo may be interrupted dont be pissy about this ive had people give me dirty looks for stopping a convo to take a picture but thats kind of what happens when you cosplay   if the cosplayer seems kind of standoffish or like the might not want to talk try asking for their instagram and perhaps try interacting there send them the picture and say it was nice meeting you great cosplay etc see how they respond to that people can be tired uncomfortable hungry thirsty etc in cosplay which a lot of people seem to forget
  please teach me your ways senpai
  join the army get ptsd learn what true horror is
is easy get just drunk enough to not be creepy everybody wants somebody to talk to and then if you dont like it just walk off
ok so say your on instagram and you have someone follow you or your following someone would it be weird or creepy to message them about an upcoming con or to do a cosplay theme with them
  asking someone youve never met/talked to do a cosplay together is a bit weird i wouldnt want to commit to something if i have no idea who this person is if you see theyre in the same area i dont see any harm in commenting and asking if theyll be at a certain con if youll be cosplaying something from the same series maybe mention it and say something like hope to see you there obviously if you talk more its a different story this is based off of having no interactions with the person
go stand in line for something it doesnt have to be something you actually want to go see and its actually better if it isnt look at your phone and find some interesting article or thing on fb then say something about it out loud and ask the people in line in front or behind you if they heard about this and what they think usually people love to offer opinions on stuff as long as its not a taboo subject since youre at a con geeky media things are probably a safe bet     if they respond positively to your opener and talk to you and they seem interesting you can keep talking to them if theyre not very friendly or the conversation isnt appealing to you say wait which panel is this line for when they answer say oh crap im in the wrong line thanks and leave     by using lines for this you can practice talking to people without really having to need a reason to approach them which can feel really awkward
  it depends if youve never interacted before thats pretty weird also if they dont follow you it can come across as an attempt to get them to do that if youve talked a bit and are mutuals id say its pretty normal though ive been in groups/done photoshoots with people ive never met irl a few times
  look at your phone and find some interesting article or thing on fb then say something about it out loud and ask the people in line in front or behind you if they heard about this and what they think    jesus christ do not do this
  this is a really sweet idea anon im not op but i have a hard time breaking the ice too and giving small gifts sounds like a great idea may i ask what youve given away and made it fit into your cosplay
  dont do this      do this  dont hand out unpackaged food though people will usually be suspicious of you
  if you cant do it outside of a con what makes you think youll do any better here if anything youll do even worse because girls lets be honest here that is your goal here are going to be getting every line from every thirsty guy at the con youre on /cgl/ so its not like you talk to anyone anyways
just following cosplayers who attend the cons you are going to attend and liking their posts on instagram helps i love taking pics with cosplayers and it happend twice that somebody recognised me from instagram last weekend i went to a convention and cosplayed a nostalgic charachter and people actually came to me to ask me for a picture which was a first if they have a cool cosplay i ask them for a picture myself this is a good way to swap social media but i havent swapped socials with anyone sadly enough i just look on instagram con hashtags to see if i can find some people i took a photo with so i can tag em in my posts
hi ladies    im a lonely guy from r9k    i come here for a gf    whos going to volunteer
die
return to r9k
  bruh look at this dood wait till you see the oh no no no
still a long day while left but considering the negative attention it attracted i think it already deserves its own thread   opinions on the odd prebooking system or what we know about the venue   are you going   which guests/stores do you hope to see there
  can someone summarize im really out of the loop but kinda want to go
  this amount of spoonfeeding really gtfo and read
  seems to me the organizers only want to throw an exclusive party for their rich friends but need a little extra money from peasant ticket sales to get their venue and guests
  1/2    event announced in early april for 2019 only the name is known two weeks later they revealed it will be held in germany  silence till august we learn that it will be held in summer 2019 no more details  gap till november filled with weird tourism tips all across germany nobody really seems to be interested in   november comes around and we finally get details on the tickets no details about the event yet the date is dropped on the picture they posted but nowhere talked about  tickets will be sold first in a exclusive presale and whats left will be available for general sale  to buy a ticket you need to register yourself before through email with your name and if you joined a past sfe event joined with your brand donated or volonteered they claim this registration is needed due to a german law  they only reveal what law this is referring to after asking multiple times the law only generally refers to pubilc events nothing that would require a registration before purchasing a ticket we are left in the dark here why it really is needed   the presale is open to those who have supported sfe events in the past this will be based on a variety of factors including past donations past volunteering past brand/stall participation and past attendance  its not clear if there is a limit for presale  its not clear if people can buy tickets in the presale for people who do not qualify for presale  its not clear how they verify past attendence or any of the factors that qualify you for presale  only statement regarding to the question how many tickets one in the presale can buy is there is no limit for registered people no clarification if registration only means the email process or the presale qualification  first guest announced atelier pierrot designer  finally the location is revealed its rudesheim  today first two locations are announed
  2/2    info on when tickets sales start is either nowhere to be found or hard to find  no info on ticket prices  generally its hard to find any information on the event its scattered everywhere  no faq  no clear information for vendors yet    i hope i got everything covered
  rudesheim was revealed before the ticket registration thing was announced but otherwise the timeline seems correct
  if the rumors are true they have different organizers in charge this year     if this is true then some new questions pop up among them the question if they have any previous experience with arranging events because this whole mess screams of inexperienced newbies panicking and just pulling whatever out of their ass because they realized this is not the same as organizing a meet and are in too deep now to back out
so will there be anything for the nonprevious attendees couldnt they just do a previous attendees teaparty at the event if they really wanted to say thank you
do you think theyll ever make a statement regarding all this criticism like an actual legit one and not vagueposting like theyve done several times regarding this bullshit lawexcuse  or will they just cover their ears and hope it goes away
kinda hoping that the moonlight sonata/cdc tickets will be available after the presale never went to any previous events and would love to go i doubt that they will though
they also released some details on this whole presale ticket thing and apparently those eligible for presale tickets can buy up to 5 tickets but every ticket holder of those must also be eligible for presale so you cant just buy a lot of tickets for your whole comm if you are eligible but they are not if i understand that correctly no idea how they want to check that though
  i want the same ticket i hope to get it after the presaletoo
how is the weather in germany during june i am already planning my coord
  this year was super hot 26  32c
  its the same organization and additional local organizers every year ive heard im curious what its like to be part of the organization
  fuck you presaler
  unlikely the best thing for a company/group to do in this situation is to admit mismanagement and follow through with transparency going forward but many companies/groups never do this due to fear of losing face further criticism and a poor understanding of how a situation like this effects them short and longterm
  why
  they could cancel tickets that dont match their list or something       hopefully no it isnt professional to publicly give in to catty gulls
people being cunts about big events like this are why we dont have tpc in the uk any more keep it up and well lose sfe too     i really hope the organisers keep doing their shit despite thisbut i understand why they choose to stop given that poorfags larping as lolitas love coming on here and whining about everything
    its literally a german law that they cant help having to follow why would they do it otherwise it would be stupid to make things more difficult than necessary also its not that hard to send an email damn not even any commitment needed to spend money just send an email    i suspect this thread is full of salty fuckers who know they wont get in on the presale cry more
  its literally a german law  they didnt specify what law that was read the previous lolita general if there is such law they are probably trying to make it a private event thus cutting costs and avoiding paper work
  why would you not cut costs and paperwork these events are volunteer run and not for profit people have full time jobs and want to give attendees the best value for money that they can
  i think you dont understand they arent rying to give attendees the best value theyre trying to get around the law by not making it a full fledged event just a private one i think its the only explanation for why they would need these emails if thats not the case thats great if it is it can get really bad for everyone attending why they wouldnt say what paragraph it is makes the whole case suspicious
  i second that i dont see the problem really i dont know yet if i can get a ticket or not but i hope i do and i look forward to the event
  if they dont make it a private event that means anyone has the right to buy a ticket and come that means they cant just refuse people entrance the way they did at under the sea
maybe they dont really need the emails but just want to see who is attending to make sure people like you dont come to the event
  this is correct i am friends with one of the organizers and she told me that last time they had issues with banned people showing up and a security person had to step in and remove them from the venue
  but they market the event as something thats not just for lolitas but for anyone interested in jfashion in general but yeah if someone is banned from a comm they cant legally refuse to sell that person a ticket if its a public event
  nothing of value was lost british lolitas are all ugly itas anyway
  say that to connies beautiful face you jelly bitch
what is the weather like in germany in early june i wonder because of the coord planning
  long faces with tiny chins look so awkward
  she uses a lot of ps anon
  read the fucking thread
  oops meant to reply to 
  all that people are asking for is fairness and transparency is that really so bad can the organizers really not provide that what are potential attendees supposed to think  i know the german organizer is crying about wanting to cut herself or w/e but i havent seen any personal attacks or bad things like that to warrant such a reaction
    look either youre a friend of the organiser or someone who has been to the events before and gets presale priority the event has been handled so badly just because its happening doesnt mean we arent allowed to criticise the very poor execution
  where did you find that info i couldnt find that anywhere
  literally it was posted to the sfe page and linked to the event page at least try to pretend you looked
  the problem is the lacking transperancy nobody would complain if were a bit more specific not only about the law issue but anything else as well  as things are now people are presented with organizers that dont give clear answers and a ticket system that seems unfair and easy to cheat not only that but information generally isnt clear cut and not easy to find instead anything is vauge or drowned in a wall of text torn between two fb pages and a lot is hidden in the comments   a little more info packed short and clear about the whole event and complaints would end  posting a faq with simple clear answers to the questions people obviously have pin that post and a lot of problems would be solved
  i dont know why someone would actively seek out cgl if they were so sensitive to the slightest criticism im as bothered by the lack of sfe transparency as anyone else but i hope she looks after herself if theyre trying to sort through things browsing cgl is definitely not keeping spirits high     any guesses for the guest announcement tomorrow i dont think itll be ap since they were in london last year maybe baby or iw wasnt isobe in finland for hellocon a few years ago itd be pretty cool     i have a feeling well get some cool artists would love to meet imai kira again shes a sweetheart
  what banned person were they banned from previous sfe events or from the local comm
    i have the feeling they will have the same guest like before atelier pierrot and imai kira were in barcelona as well    
  from the local comm
has anyone gotten a reply to their registration email yet
  i hoped theyd have someone different im not sure if i want to drop the money for this event anymore if theres not going to be anything very big like they were getting everyone excited for    does anyone else get way too overwhelmed to shop at these events ive been to uts and a few tpcs and i always end up in a daze no idea what i want and end up buying something in the heat of the moment that i never end up wearing
  i have they just said thank you for registering
  just got my presale email anyone else
so are all the organizers of street fashion europe just americans now i keep seeing americans post updates about the event in all of the sfe groups some european event
  sfe has grown bigger than just european lolitas for some reason there are us and aus people involved maybe even more that we dont know about yet  it doesnt really bother me much but its definitely strange i cant blame someone for wanting to work with friends or people they know and can trust    i feel bad saying it but im underwhelmed by the guest announcements i love imai kira but ive met her twice at european events already and im not as excited as i probably should be for atelier pierrot like   said the hype they were building suggested that they were going to announce something much bigger
they have their own little elitist group of people octavkitten and her us friends and kyra and her eu friends they travel back and forth between europe and the us to hold secret events and meetups
  it only bothers me because theyre competing with european events in a weird way like when they announced the country on the same day the ticket sale for another event started
  i dont like kyra but meeting up with your friends is not a secret event or meetup lmao
they actively exclude people they dont like in their little elitist vacations i would love to join one but they organize these via private groups or group chats this is more than meeting friends they are around 30 people
    elitist vacations  secret events and meetups    are you seriously bitching that friends are meeting up and doing things without inviting entire communities friend activities arent public events why on earth would you get salty about something like this     if i was going to visit lolita friends abroad and do something fun i sure as shit wouldnt invite their local comm or put out a public invite are you crazy
  yeah that rubbed me the wrong way from the start it has seemed like sfe is trying to centralise all the eu events and have one big event a year instead of communities holding their own events and inviting their own guests they definitely tried to take the spotlight from that event cant remember which one it was    i quite like the smaller events so i hope this doesnt discourage anyone sure i love the idea of huge parties with champagne and roses cascading down castle staircases and exciting guests but small dos with indie brands and a chance to talk to new people are so much more fun to me as i spend more time in the fashion
  maybe shes friends with a lot of them but doesnt get an invite otherwise i dont know how she knows about these events
i dont care about guest as much as i care about meeting friends and event activities so i am happy that this event will be smaller and have more activities where you can talk and get to know people i have never been to germany but it was always on my bucket list maybe i wear a dirndl coord lol
  i think it was hellocon in finland     germany also has had events with small indie brands but i dont remember what that was called
  anon is probably talking about halloween haus or something that they saw a few pictures of some people who attended posted about it on insta     anon if youre not getting an invite theres probably a reason for it and it might be tied to bitching on cgl about people you want to be friends with you sound like youre trying to famewhore and that shit dont fly with more lowkey older groups of lolitas
  yea anon might be over reacting but i kind of understand where they r coming from i follow mossmarchen on instagram and facebook and she hosts one of these secret events and rubs it in everyones face every halloween facebook statuses and posting photos of her and her group of people that she invited i get that these are her friends but it would be nice if they would open up more and be less exclusive
see post on event about presale emails  never been to sfe event in no way eligible  check email anyway  mfw
  but the hellocon and sfe organizers are friends one hellocon organizer is also in sfe
  posting about doing something nice with friends is hardly rubbing it in everyones face have you tried talking to any of these people or befriending them honestly if me and a bunch of friends did something like this i wouldnt want to invite people we didnt know itd be really weird
  yea tuulia organizes for both
  if you mean the events organised by das teekranzchen they had peppermint fox and angelic pretty last year but this year only small events with handmade brands afaik
what is haus is it eu or us
  i think its us i dont know too much about it but from what i gathered on instagram a bunch of lolitas organised by the girl behind mossmarchen rent out a house and have a halloween party of sorts with a photographer and wear spooky coords it sounds like a lot of fun i definitely get pangs of jealousy when i see the photos and snippets id love to do something like this with friends
  there are several small lolita events with indie brands in europe but sfe is not one of them theyll probably announce their main guest later check out the facebook group lolita events in europe for other events
  id never heard of that group before thanks anon    itd be shitty of them to hold back a guest until after tickets have gone on sale imo i think that might be all they have
  its normal for large festivals to do that sometimes in germany and the netherlands dont know about anywhere else
  damn i didnt know meta came to russia
  thats nothing unusual dont see the problem there either uts sold out without even having any guests announced
so was it people who attended any past event or only those who had been to every event if its the latter i have slightly higher hopes of getting a ticket
if were talking about street fashion europe in general what ever happened to the mook they were supposed to be making the last fb update was oct 31st 2017 did they just drop it not get submissions i completely forgot about it until it popped up in a facebook search
  i follow marie on insta and she posted some drawings she said were for the book on insta last month
holy shit friends meeting friends and you guys act as if it was some secret conspiracy no wonder u have no one to hang out with let them have fun with their friends sorry i dont have any
i honestly dont care about supah exclusice friends groups and i love living vicariously through their photos i just wish octavekitten would shut the fuck up about whatever american sjw train she jumped on while praising russia to high heavens shes like a liberal version of trump its almost funny
  it was one person tbh it just feels like youre trying to take attention away from the trainwreck that is sfe
  there are definitely a load of lolitas who have a massive hard on for russia the event in spain was completely themed around russian culture and imagery which is super weird    russia is kinda fucked up and seeing people talk about it like its trendy and fashionable is really jarring espeically influential lolitas like octavekitten
  nothings going to take the attention away dont worry but come on lets talk about stuff that actually matters in relation to the event like are past attendees getting presale emails
    i wouldnt be bothered so much if she didnt do her daily virtue signaling over ridiculous issues she makes a mountain of which i find repugnant in the light of how fucked russias government and ideals are     i think russians are beautiful and great coordinators but the fascination to the point where wk defending them with tooth and nail is interesting to say the least 
  the event in madrid is not people glorifying russia lol its just a theme like if you name your theme victorian royalty does that mean you supports imperialism
  shes lost it did anyone see her rant about some small goth market not having any black artists/crafters apparently none applied and her response was go find some you cant force people to take part in your niche craft fair jesus christ   and the shrunken head thing fucking hell    she and her pet russians can get fucked shes so obsessive its cringey she even likes russian chocolate and anyone in eastern europe will tell you alonka tastes like ass compared to pretty much any other chocolate you can get
how can they even afford to do all this traveling
  good jobs and/or saving also why is it your business what does it have to do with the event
  i could travel to another country like 5 times a year just with my benefits lol
  likes russian chocolate  oh fuck no this thing tastes like mildly sweet cardboard that was sitting in a shelf for 2 months and has gotten wet
  most adults are able to take one good vaca abroad every year ppl with good jobs can afford more
  if you live in europe you can go on holiday abroad for less than 100 euro
so sfe confirmed for picking and choosing who will be able to buy tickets   seems like some people who have gone to all past events got no presale while others who went once did is there a rhyme or reason to this favoritism fuckery
  what i went to three events and didnt get a presale link also my other friends didnt get one only one friend who attended all four events
got my presale mail an hour ago 3
  went to all 4 events 
  i went only two and got my mail and i never was a volunteer or something else this systems seems pretty strange and unfair
  same
going to better they are kicking peope out of the registration for the pre sale because they question the system their transparency and give feedback and critics super fair open your mouth and you will be just cut out
  caps
  sure of it organizers begun to make passive aggressive posts too clear up your damn system and stop picking favourites
  theres mostly america and japan based people in staff this year actually
  as a previous sfe organiser we have always helped each other at organising events in our home countries sharing our brand/guest network and making ourselves useful to the rest     sure theres a big event every year but comms in the uk till the tpc wrapped it up finland the netherlands france have always been together and helped each other as much as others required
  that event was not tied to sfe at all it was organised by two members of the spanish community not affiliated to sfe
  influential lolitas    ok
  in fairness ill admit to being influenced by octavekitten  anything she likes or any trends she furthers are an immediate nope from me
    if you hate the orgs and how they do things so much why do you even still want to go     also way to out yourself with your janky english totally obvious who you are
  unhealthy salty fixation is the most worrying form of flattery get over yourself       any evidence for this or are we just making shit up now to warrant further outrage for not being in the cool club     in all seriousness im very curious about their reasoning behind offering presale to only some past attendees with people who have attended once getting the chance but not always people who have been to several    any guesses for other guests im hoping for vm
   im very curious about their reasoning behind offering presale to only some past attendees with people who have attended once getting the chance but not always people who have been to several    is there any proof of this actually happening though aside from people anonymously saying that it has happened to be honest i wouldnt put it past people lying about getting tickets when they havent attended events to rile more people up about the ticketing system
  nobody has submitted any screenshots so it does just seem like anonymous hearsay this system does seem confusing but im willing to bet theres some method to the madness or i hope so anyway i hope there are still tickets left for us who didnt make the presale though ive given up hope on attending the tea party if the organizers have been parsing through hundreds of registration emails       vm would be awesome would love to see a diverse style line up for the fashion show     side note i guess the translation of the event name is dreaming or daydream google translatedont know any german so im curious how everything will fit the theme seems whimsical
  there wont be any tickets left for us its a small venue
     so negative anon you never know you might get a ticket plus people will drop out closer to the event and want to resell their tickets
  its a big venue and if you ever done these events you would know that it isnt hard to get tickets the vip will sell out fast but you have a good chance with the others
  there is some comments on the events post of not getting invite or getting or further questioning
      noits a small event of 300 people
  the organisers have said to email them if you believe you should have had a ticket invite its not some conspiracy to stop people from getting tickets       small venue  less than 300 people    in what world is that a small event
  fuck off daniela the organisers havent even told you what the capacity is i hope you dont get a ticket your sour face would look hideous in group pictures
  sorry you dont have any friends to pitch in the costs for a weekend getaway   literally nothing is wrong with halloween haus its a group of friends hanging out not everything has to be a meet but then again you prolly dont even wear lolita   back to the topic  träumerai is still sus imo but these pathetic nitpicks are derailing no one cares about mossmarchen or the us lolitas i just want to be sure im not hauling my ass to europe for a shit show
     noits a small event of 300 people    what they actually said is greater than 300 people just in case their opinion wasnt ridiculous enough
  the netherlands  this comm has a lot of drama and changed mod team several times if btb is to be believed the organiser of under the sea is not even a mod there anymore     i know someone said the person who organised hellocon is also part of the sfe team but it was shady and unnecessary of sfe to suddenly announce something after being quiet for so long on the exact same day as hellocon started ticket sale
  it sounds like if you have been to all 4 you get a presale otherwise you can get it for being a volunteer donating before old organizer etc so the pool is smaller than what you guys think i highly doubt 300 people are in this pool of people and you can only get extra tickets for people who registered so it isnt a free for all
i havent seen proof of people who only went to 12 events getting a presale link only people who went to all 4 or volunteered     i just think its weird to thank people who have been to the event 4 times as if theyre superior to people who just started wearing lolita last year or lolitas who couldnt attend all previous events because they couldnt get a ticket ive been wearing lolita for over 5 years but i didnt even know sfe existed until la vie en rose thats not my fault thats their failure to promote enchanted well    ive been to 3 of their events but i didnt email them maybe if i really love the guests ill try to get a ticket secondhand but so far it doesnt feel like this event will be as good as omnia vanitas which was my favourite sfe event so far thank you for reading my blog
i honestly appreciate the sfe events and always had a good time when i attended its sad that the organizers do such a poor job at communicating why they make certain decisions and act so offended and immature when someone offers criticism this leads to so much drama that would be totally unnecessary and easily avoided except for the ungrateful bitches that whine why the event isnt in their neighborhood or that the tickets are expensive but those people are easily ignored but several people had legitimate questions that should be answered with a little more transparency and instead they get passive aggressive vague posting sfe are not professionals and nobody expects them to be 100 professional at all times but acting in a mature way in front of your customers is not too hard i get that sometimes you need to vent but do it in private like the rest of us what saddens me most is that i usually would tell them this directly without the need of posting anonymously on stupid cgl but despite claiming to want things said to their faces they react poorly to direct critique i want to attend the event because i am sure it will be great so i do not want the people in charge to hold a grudge against me maybe they read this and take some points to heart you are doing a great job just your communication needs some work
  kyra has always been passive aggressive when you ask questions though
  completely its an issue me and plenty others have had
  not daniela but thats ok keep defending your little shitshow
  fucking europoors learn to speak english better and get a job that pays enough that you can afford to go to events on the same continent as you
  shut up octavekitten go nibble on your shitty chocolate and jerk off to putin some more
  yeah thats the only issue people have with this event they cant afford to go
      all three of you seem like lovely people     to get things back on topic the location looks really pretty but im not sure what else there will be to do outside of the event how long are people planning on staying there for i was thinking of staying for the weekend in the location and then maybe exploring germany a bit for a few days after
  you could make a short trip to wiesbaden its only half an hour by train
  looks grand    do you know if there are any good places to go hiking nearby
  nayrt but if theres a group if people who want to go hiking in the area probably not wearing lolita id be up for it
  thats brilliant id love to make some hiking buddies ill do some research then maybe make a post on one of the pages/ event nearer the time
  ooh id love to go hiking as well i wish the city was closer to köln/bonn but frankfurt is nice too wouldnt mind going there for a day if people are interested
  gosh i wont even be going to träumerei but wiesbaden is my hometown and now i feel totally temped to meet other gulls for hiking
  actually when looking at the venues it appears that the one for saturday has rooms holding up to 100 people and the one for sunday fits up to 180 people  of course i could be wrong due to them having made some sort of special arrangements in combining rooms
  from what ive heard about ticket numbers i think youre right
do sfe events generally have a bring and buy thats where i spent most of my time shopping at tpc events but i know it was organised by someone separate from the tpc team
  no
  it was someone else organising the bb maybe if you want to volunteer to arrange one you can be of use for the community
  as cool as it would be imagine hauling all your stuff to sell internationally
  lol haus is run pretty much the same way everyone think this event is being run marchen sends out invites by waves starting with the most favorable/popular people then if there is spots to be filled shell start ranking people from the lesser/filler section to make sure she gets her deposit fulfulled for haus marchen has been this terrible and vapid person for years blacklisting people or being super passive aggressive to people who ever crossed her in the slightest she also never paid for the illustrations that she uses for her brand shes just a terrible person in general but everyone she surrounds herself with is still drinking that shitty koolaid
  was it moss marchen that posted a please pm me on violet fanes latest release post on insta it was on a post featuring the quote love perfected by death on a new vf dress i wonder is she salty because she has the same quote on enamel pins i hope im just reading into this too much and its actually no big deal    im pretty sure the images she uses are public domain please correct me if im wrong but the craftmanship just doesnt seem all that great other than the enamel pins she also jumped hardcore onto the embroidered brooch/pendant thing as soon as my inspiration started getting popular
  im not sure which one it was exactly as i distanced myself from her but it was definitely one she commissioned from a fellow friend that confirmed never being paid for it im sure it was also her that pmed violet fane mossmarchen also guilt trips and attacks anyone that has anything similar to her brand shes done this before with voodooodolly im sure for my inspiration etc etc she pretty much treats lolitas as a sort of her collection where she can dump and replace people with ease its very eerie and she has been doing this for many years im not the first nor the last and theres already a growing number of people she already burned that dont associate with her anymore
  seems pretty ballsy to attack vdd i always got the impression that the vdd designer was fairly well respected    im almost sure it was the same group of people that dragged hello bones jones through the dirt for daring to have brooches that were a little similar to pepfox ohtralala definitely made a huge deal out of it and everyone rallied around her it was a shame i really wanted one of their bunny umbrella brooches
  yeah moss marchen has a tendency to usually send out her goons to attack her brand competition thats what she did to me and a friend of mine to go after vdd i also went after lockshop for literally making exact replicas of mossmarchens necklaces but to be fair thats probably just a replica of a juliette et justine necklace as well mossmarchen isnt the greatest at coming up with her own ideas
another guest announcement tonight this is probably the one that will make my mind up for whether or not i want to try getting tickets next weekend if there are any left    any guesses hoping for vm like someone else said also it would be cool to see an unexpected guest like novala takemoto i know hes not as publicly active but he did give an interview for the so pretty/very rotten book so who knows
  what was it like to be one of her goons i dont mean this in a condescending way but were you friends with her once or how did you get involved
  i was friends with her a good amount of years we were pretty close or so i thought this was before her brand even started not saying she didnt always act this way but i think with her brand ballooning it gave her the power and confidence to be more open about how she treats other people i definitely wont say it wasnt great she always let her close group know first when tickets for her tea parties were going up or when she was doing a sales post on lj but as she got more obsessed with her brand she started treating me and other people worse and worse and it got to the point i couldnt handle being friends with her anymore she also gossips about everyone behind their back even if you think youre the closest bosom buddies with her because sorry but youre not a lot of people still choose to stick around with her even if they get mistreated by her because they still want that inclusiveness and those who havent will just respond with well that never happened to me personally with mossmarchen if you wonder why the new york city group is in such a mess from a few years ago i definitely would not say she wasnt a part of that
  im so sorry she treated you like that sounds awful i dont understand what people get from sticking with people who are openly awful i guess they feel like theyre part of some super special club and thats what that whole group feels like from the outside     theres a huge problem with people like that getting away with shit in the lolita community and in other hobbies too ofc plenty of people who essentially have public figure status in this niche community who abuse their influence and get away with it
  its okay it seems im just doomed to attract these types of people i also tried calling out a manipulative and crazy pathological liar out on the west coast and ended up getting kicked out of their community its very odd to see these types of people and how easily they can manipulate and convince others to believe in whatever they say this person apparently accused me of posting her real address online when i dont even remember where she lives because i honestly didnt care about her anymore even at that point in time but this is how far people are willing to go to attack others that see through their bullshit also i know alex from sfe is good friends with mossmarchen because she flew all the way from germany just to attend halloween haus thats some crazy commitment right there
  im an amerifag but i love these salty bloomers     beautiful  anon shes very cute but her lips are very small and her face is long i like long faces though so im biased as always beauty is in the eye of the beholder
i know its not something theyve done for previous sfe events but i wonder why they wont publicly say how many tickets are available someone asked on facebook and they said its not something they do     seems weird considering people are so worried about not getting a chance to buy them at all
  they dont want to release a number because they only want certain people going if they say the venue can hold 300 and yet they only sell 120 tickets people are going to wonder why
  keep your paranoia at bay i guarantee they will be around the 300 mark for main event tea party will obviously be smaller capacity what other major event do you even know that names their capacity
the third guest has just been announced and its triple fortune  whats your opinion on this i think its a bit boring and predictable but they are nice and fun guests
  meh brands i dont care about this whole thing has left a bad taste in my mouth i hope everyone attending has fun but its not for me i dislike events that dont disclose things that seemingly should be open that silly law thing just made me bristle i dont even care that theyre doing this exclusive ticket thing  they shouldnt have to pretend like theyre going by the law just to justify their own decisions
  you paranoid bitches are hilarious
  mad that someone has a different thought on the situation to you gosh i thought cgl was a hivemind so whatever shall we do now that we have conflicting opinions
  its just funny the extrapolation from normal organiser secrecy to eu lolita illuminati is really funny
  i dont think im being paranoid i just think this is the single dumbest way of being exclusive exclude if you want but be up front about it dont pretend like youre all going by the law when you actually want to just have a list that you can pick and choose from   id be eligible for the presale but its giving me a bit of an old boys club feel to it one of the reasons i go to events is to meet people i dont know yet
  its literally german law why is this so hard for some people to understand
  literally  barely why then were they so unwilling to refer directly to the law come on i want to believe theyre not even doing that for nefarious purposes but they handled it very poorly       pretty disappointed but predicted theyre lovely people but theres nothing so far that id be excited about
  look were not going to agree so i think this is a moot point since i dont think either of us are going to be giving new information  but the fact that germany holds loads of events and ive never been to one thats been done like this baffles me not just lolita but other things too im not the only confused one
  anyone else notice that this announcement is only in the sfe group and not on the event page
  we dont have any law here that require a registration for just showing interest to buying a ticket  sincerely a german gull
  sm please fuck off im so sick of you popping out of the woodwork to talk shit about everyone even though your own life is in shambles and you dont have a leg to stand on being broke and jobless must be really boring
  well if vdd copied mm i dont see why her anger isnt justified copying someone elses designs is awful what did she allegedly copy
  ah here comes the pathological liar out of the wood works on cue spouting lies every time i come up i actually do have a job and just bought myself a new television but keep deluding yourself into thinking i give a shit about what you think about me i already moved on youre still lingering like an old shit stain       this wasnt for vdd copying mm more of some of her older pieces looked similar to blood milk jewelry
  i really would like to know what law that is ive been to lolita events in germany before and none of them had that kind of requirement
  you need serious help i often times question how idd is still friends with you giving the reputation that you have but you both like to hate circle jerk on mm so i guess youre both awful
  because im a good person and she realizes that as well im not sure what serious help i need but okay lol vdd also doesnt like mm so i guess we all hate circle jerking together honestly youre just picking at straws now and reflecting again
  youre a good person and youre on cgl shit talking because you have nothing better to do haha you make me laugh hope idd and vdd find out that you secretly talk shit about them behind their back and are mearly just hanging around them for bragging points
i am wondering if the registration is due to avoid the registration of the event at german authorities which is necessary for big public events if they have the mails they could claim it is private but never the less they announced it at facebook and sold tickets so it would not make a difference for german law  but that is just my guess
  the registration is literally so they can pick and choose who goes thats it nothing deeper    t know the organizer
  anymore interesting deets about the registration and how they are handling the event planning then   does she have a habit of sending people to defend her on cglor go herself not saying people that defend this mess are her goons or anything but some posts are just so oddly worded even for trolls/roleplayers
  i keep out of it but i think there are people defending on the thread who arent just anons with opinions theyre the people who have a stake in this and dont want there to be hate going this way in short youre probably right
  my fault for wording  poorly but i dont know who the people who are defending are exactly but i think they are probably involved or also friends with the organizer
  just going by the poster count at least 70 people in this thread people probably arent trolling people have legitimate reasons to get stuff off their chest about the organisation methods i dont know about anyone else but the reason im on cgl to do it anonymously is because publicly saying that it sounds fishy is a bad move   much as id love to publicly say on the event page that this all feels off sfe organisers hold a lot of social power within the lolita community and i dont want to be witch hunted or blacklisted     as for the whiteknight anons im willing to bet at least one organiser has posted in the thread theyve been watching it and even before this specific thread one organiser said she couldnt handle the negative backlash online and everyone was meanies etc when really people just wanted answers i cant blame them for wanting to defend themselves some anons in this thread have gotten waaay off topic and are just going in for fruitless personal attacks but if it is who i think it is please spend more time making your event look less sketchy
  good thing i happened to screencap the posts regarding the law when it was discussed in lolita general lol    i dont feel like going the extra mile and fetch the link to the bullshit law sfe linked to but you can find it in the comment reply on the first post on their announcement about having to preregister
  this kind of rage in response to people not hopping on your personal choice of dick is unhealthy    before you go making accusations again examine yourself
  im sorry youre such a psychopath but im not talking shit whatsoever about them and are actually really good friends you just keep reaching for the shittiest lies to try to paint me in a bad light also just because i post on here doesnt make me a bad person coming up with lies constantly about me though is a bit concerning you really should just get a life
im curious why people want to go to this event so badly with such underwhelming guests if i remember correctly they used to announce the main brand guest before the ticket sale
presale is live anyone have luck
reports on fb that people selected for presale havent gotten their emails yet hope this can be rectified im really rooting for sfe to pull this back and do well
no paypal option sitting here ready to order 
  it aint all about the guests but the experience also its ild so it should be hyped
  so many people havent got their email yet the system they used to send out emails apparently makes them land in spam also no paypal option only credit card which people also didnt know beforehand
  they definitely mentionrd the payment method beforehand but its a shame that they dont accept paypal as its pretty easy for anyone without a standard card     yeah theres people posting that they didnt get their email until 1920 and people saying that the moonlight ticket was sold out before 1900 even though sfe said that only 20 people had opened their emails anyone on presale here who can confirm this
  the instructions from a few days ago said no paypal but really who doesnt have a cc at this point that person is dumb       it wasnt sold out when i clicked but i wasnt trying for that tier
  youre an asshole
aw should not be handling support on fb she is so defensive and everything is an attack to her so immature for an event organiser to get huffy and put in emoji faces when people are asking questions makes it feel like she doesnt care
  ooh and now shes deleting her own comments
  but really who doesnt have a cc at this point that person is dumb  you might not belive it but in germany its actually not rare to not have a cc as a young adult we love to pay everything in cash or just using our debit card for everything most people i know only got a cc after they landed their first secure job and after they knew they are stable enough for bigger purchases i personally didnt own a cc until i was 22 before that i usually asked my parents to lend me their cc for booking flights etc i know this seems retarded but again its not uncommon here and its just what many people do this no cc ordeal is a big fuck you to germans actually
  most european comms never organise anything for ild i doubt most of them know when it is
  last time people complained that the only payment method was through paypal some people couldnt buy a ticket because of ongoing paypal disputes they freeze your account as well when you open a dispute against someone      you dont normally need a creditcard outside america especially in the eu where people can just pay everywhere with their bank card nobody in my family has a creditcard they just made it much more difficult for german lolitas to buy tickets since ordering your first creditcard can take more than a week
  caps people keep saying she complains about negative feedback but nobody posted any proof
    so i cant use my debit card at all why are they using a system which wont accept debit cards
  i used my debit card just fine
  im not sure how you buy things online then most places that dont use paypal work the same way paypal is the devil so going direct to your card is better for you       if your card is a debit visa or something to that affect it should work
  from what i can tell the vip tickets were already sold out or sold out even though only 20 people opened the email how many vip tickets were there and by that i mean how many did the organizer give to her friends before the sale
  you dont need a creditcard to buy things online in europe
  my comm always has events for summer and winter ild and i have seen plenty of german comms have events for ild as well      sure credit cards are not as common in europe as they are in the usa but almost everyone that has visited japan at some point has one pretty much every lolita that has been in the hobby for some years has been there at some point so its really not that uncommon to have a credit card as an european lolita and you could plan ahead ask relatives or friends to let them use your card for this one occasion if you really didnt have one but i agree that a paypal option would have been good
  believe it or not but other countries have their own version of paypal and that usually offers them better protection than paypal
  pretty much every lolita that has been in the hobby for some years has been there at some point  where are you from i only know 4 people that have been to japan in total 1 of them went for work and only 2 of them are lolitas in my family only 1 person has a creditcard and when we travel we all borrow hers to book the flight though for some airlines you dont even need a creditcard
how are ticket stocks looking right now i hoping i can snag a crystal dream ticket next weekend
  almost taken all
  across all ticket types
  from the way they word it i think presale may not have been the whole amount    but only the moonlight is sold out really
  not gonna reveal too much but i was a fledgling indie brand repeatedly anonymously attacked by those mm goons you may have been one of them and i just wanna get it off my chest that it was super fucked up and caused a lot of fear/paranoia for a few years she accused me of copying something of hers the items in question were not replicas but i stepped on her toes and that was that many of her friends/those she affiliates with distanced themselves from me before id ever formally met them some even unfollowing my business page because of that kind of gossip making it many times harder to grow a fanbase in an already niche community so im glad youve stepped away from doing that attack dog stuff now but just know that doing things like that really does have negative consequences on the people who are wrongfully on the other side of the attack since i never copied her to begin with i hope it never happens again and im concerned shes still doing this with other indie brands as well i wish violet fane would speak out about what may be happening if it is anything like this experience
  ive also heard that mm does this from us designers i am friends with i definitely believe both of you
  shes not a sfe organizer anymore
        there are no hellocon organizers or finnish people in sfe
  im sorry this happened to you and im sorry if i was one of those that attacked you though from my recollection it was only the ones i mentioned above i was involved in but then again mm would mock anyone that might even be a competitor in her eyes even when i helped her at her booth she would say derogatory comments to potential customers under her breath as soon as they turned away so no one was safe from her venomous tongue i stopped being friends with her a few years now though i did attend the first halloween haus but i cut her off i think two rufflecons ago the one where someone dumped a bunch of mm shit in the consignment room that was me
there was just a callout post on sfe but it got denied almost instantly screen caps of sfe staff saying fishy stuff about tickets
  seriously source       do you happen to remember any of it before it got deleted im not trying to stir shit said on cgl kek but i would be pretty bummed if i couldnt get a ticket for this event this is the first sfe that isnt super far/wont be super expensive for me to travel to
  there was this girl k that started whining about not getting the link to the presale in time this thing escalated and k is now threatening them with legal action    i dont know if i am the only one that thinks this hysteria and threatening legal action for a ticket to a party is too muchbut holy hell
  she also posted screenshots that incriminated her for trying to get into a previous sfe event without paying she was trying to paint the organisers as bad guys by posting evidence that she herself is a sketchy character incredible
  i dont think the organisers said anything fishy if anything its now clearer that the preref system was indeed to keep out banned people and creepers which seems sensible    the tldr of the screenshots was that the organisers decided the k girl had done enough bad shit to warrant having her presale access revoked shes not banned and can still get normal sale tickets
  nah it wasnt fishy if anything it gave clarity posting everything would be a loottt but here is some info on the registering
      and here the sfe damage control bots come
  okay but then couldnt they just have said wed like people to register with us so we can verify they participate in the jfashion community i dont think anyone could have an issue with that and even if they did it makes the issue so much more clear cut       id like to see the rest anon
  ill let these speak for themselves    1/2
  2/2    im amazed they gave her presale access despite trying to sneak in without paying to a past event
  i agree it would have been good to state from the start but i suspect the result would be the same people would still accuse the organisers of choosing friends at least it is now out in the open     all that is besides the point now the pre sale is all done how many moonlight sonata tickets do we think went up for sale
  its like 30 caps so im not sure its worth it the post is public tho       pic related to the ticket situation it seemed like the other girl besides the op of the fb post is someone who causes shit
i think there wouldnt have been so much salt against them if that thank you presale was just for volunteers making it for people who attended events previously was a mistake and hurt a lot of german lolitas imagine being excited this event is finally in your country only to find out they give preference to people from other countries whove already attended before
idk if anyone has already posted about this but i spent way too much time censoring names to not post these    but it finally happened someone openly called out sfe on this whole deal
  thats exactly it   plus attending 1 2 or 3 previous events was not considered enough past support although someone donating or volunteering just once would qualify for presale    it doesnt help that most of the vip tickets were already gone even before the presale went live because they set them aside for volunteers
  the facebook thread in question
  what that doesnt make sense the pre sale was for volunteers wasnt it
  and the email in question seems to be missing a part but most of it is there at least
this is getting really boring i just want to talk about event plans without you salty bitches coming in and shitting up the thread with your pointless drama
  i see no bitchfit here just someone defending their position i actually think both sides were very civil and fair in this thread
  a certain someone appeared and threw a bitchfit out of this world    reupload because i didnt censor a couple of names properly
  not exactly volunteers didnt have to worry about buying in the presale round so in theory this could be someone without the previous support criteria the presale was for previous volunteers contributors 4 event attendees on the other hand
  by volunteers do you mean organisers of this event because if so it makes sense that they get tickets first as they do need to be there
  this so much i really would have loved to but i just wasnt able to attend all previous events because deaths in my family and other shit in my life happening which prevented me from doing so this criteria that you had to be at all previous events is ridiculous people have lives shit happens having the time to travel to a different country on a very short notice every fucking year is unrealistic for some if not most people that doesnt mean that we are not supportive the times i was able to attend their events i got the most expensive ticket option and spent hundres of euros on vendors still not enough support i guess   and now that they have introduced this system that it matters at how many previous events you have been that in fact you have to have been at all previous events and in case they are going to keep it those people that got first dibs this year will also get first first dibs every year to come and those people that werent able to get a ticket this year will have even less chances to get a ticket next year new lolitas can only dream of ever being part of this got luck fighting for the last few tickets that are left    t german lolita who didnt get a presale link and wont even bother with the scraps that are left
  i also think thats really weird and kind of mean to the people who couldnt get tickets previously thank you presale for making it even more difficult for people to attend who have always wanted to go its not like people who went to all 4 events did it to support sfe those people just have more freedom to travel and had better luck in previous ticket sales
   ___   __  what age is this woman
im done with this event the organisers have shown their true colours people were afraid to speak up with concerns in case they werent allowed in and thats exactly what has happened    i hope theyre happy sfe and their international friends can do what they want i cant process how unprofessional the organisers are and how badly theyre handling everything
  perhaps shes old enough to be from the time when using those faces was not embarrassing
  the samefag in this thread is so strong on all sides
  youre implying the person who criticised them has to return her ticket lol      saying this gives germany a bad name is nagl
  didnt it say in the post that they revoked her tickets because of this
    they had their tickets returned but are allowed to buy tickets from the normal sale period
  the whiteknighting for sfe also
  i literally said both sides
  the girl k was someone who repeatedly was a shit disturber are you really surprised that being dumb has consequences she easily could have remarked on the email issue without throwing a fit     but im glad we got some info from this better than vagueness about why registering was needed
  this thread has twice as many posters as the lolita general
  im personally confused as to why her friend was punished along with her since the friend apparently didnt know what k had done in the past
  the sfe white knights are especially funny because these are the types of people who swear theyd never go on somewhere like cgl
  d bought for k so i guess decided to refund both maybe you cant refund part of an order but i feel bad for d for choosing bad friends
so if you donate youre guaranteed a ticket is it too late to donate
  it was for people who donated to previous events otherwise everyone would have just offered to make a donation to get access
  the 30 tickets are a joke
i am not attending träumerei and dont want to start new drama and i dont know if it was already said but   i am german i organise lolitaevents as well and i have a friend that is a german lawyer and i just want to point out there literally is no such law sfe is referring too    so thanks for listening guys    plus kyra saying the german lolitas are toxic af doenst really help at all and is pretty unprofessional
  i feel like in that case thats even worse to me its like rubbing salt into a wound you cant have these special tickets you were trying so hard to get we take them but take these reject pleb tickets instead so we can still use you as cash cows you lowly peasants thats how it comes off to me anyway  also not bothering to attend this event so im not trying to choose either side just voicing my honest opinion 
  you can still get tickets at the general sale    i dont give a shit about these events and im here only for the drama but ffs you can buy the tickets and people resell tickets     honestly the vip is only worth for the extra shopping hour and youre only getting guests that everyone has already seen
  they probably had to refund the whole purchase
  there were two posts against sfe one with the special ticket stuff and one against the whole sfe orga which was posted in the group both are public
  did anyone get caps or is it just whats already posted here
  hi karin
  its basically the same thing horse girl just shared the ticket stuff and complained about registeration which is explained under d stuff she is more annoying because its all x is illegal and how dare they ask questions to make sure attendees are lolitas bitch chill
  screenshot 1
  screenshot 2
  bish im not karin just a random german frilly ass who does not want to be thrown in one pot and thinks its hilarious that ppl believe such a dumb law exists actually if sfe would care about laws they would be a eingetragener verein like court of fables germany because if you dont are helding events like these come with a lot of problems considered with law in germany    plus i just want to defend us germans because we are not all toxic we usually just chill drink alcohol and eat shitty food    also i met karin personally and dont even like her because she isnt the brightest candle on the cake
i was planning on attending this event i even took off of work for the dates already planned my coordinates but after this i wont be supporting the event its very fishy and unprofessional and now all of the love posts from the organizers friends are pathetic i might just go to paris with friends during my week off
  friends showing love and support for friends how dare they
    whoever she is she died for our sins sfe fucked up regardless of whether k was in the right or not its not just about her theres so much else
  if you love your friends then you know they deserve to know if theyre doing something wrong friends dont let friends etc
  if youve tried getting tickets for their previous events you know its really difficult the website always crashes and the wanted tickets sell it within a minute
  yeah the vip ones do the general entry ones tend to be up for ages before selling out
  i dont know what drama the girl who called it out has been in im just going off her post  nothing that she said hasnt been thought by other lolitas or said on this thread sure its a bit dramatic but seriously shes got a point
  this she wasnt as cool and collected as she maybe should have been but she had every right to be upset with how the whole thing was handled
what did she do at enchanted other than sneak in
  go for the fun of the event and the friends you can make
  and spend that much money just to make friends i can make friends while traveling to a better country with more interesting things to do rather than circle jerk with a bunch of old elitists in a boring area of germany not the person you were responding to by the way i just find in inane to try to convince someone to go like its just down the lane from everyone
  a lot of interesting people are going and the idea they are elitist just because they bought a ticket is silly so is not going because a few bad apples are stirring drama about tickets     you can want to go to the event and think the organizers should change a few things it isnt one or the other
why is it alwys the german events that fuck up that hamburg am event was aweful as well why cant we have nice things
  didnt the hamburg event had similar drama as well with people reserving tickets for local comm members before the sale
  you cant really make new friends at such an event though there isnt opportunity to socialise with people youve never met unless by coincidence you sit next to someone at some point who is by herself and speaks the same language as you but during the activities you dont talk with anyone you have to be quiet to listen to the guests and the rest of the time you just walk around with your friends and take pictures during teaparty you would also sit next to the friends you already knew
  i have met both new people at big events easily especially when there is liquor and figured out how to be friendly with those who dont know english well latter is harder but you have google translate     this is like the lolita version of how do i talk to ppl at cons you have to be social and recognize a ton of people are foreigners who are looking to meet friends just like you
  one of my best friends is someone i met at uts sure we didnt become bffs right there but we met there and then we talked online and suddenly friendship
    you really cant let anything go can you    youre not missed in any comms youve been banned from
  you must be socially retarded then i met plenty of people when i went alone the trick is to just approach people who seem unoccupied compliment them on their coord and then engage in a conversation you can also easily spot people who are there by themselves you are not the only one
  when i went alone  exactly
  making lies about the millions of communities im banned from again like you accused me of being banned from the nyc community and that was a gigantic lie lmao i wont let anything you go or anyone manipulative until you get the just desserts you deserve for ruining so many peoples lives with your constant harassment and bullshit flying out of your ass so keep it coming i got plenty of popcorn right here waitingtrust me im not afraid of you at all youre just a sad pathetic joke that regurgitates the same sad fibs to try to discredit me
    could both of you take this shit somewhere else none of us cares about your argument between each other you are just making both your sides look bad
  i would if she would stop harassing me so ball is in her court but shes also a pyschopath so who knows i was actually on topic earlier before she started coming for me but to stay on topic it does seem a lot of the new york city lolitas are now a part of the sfe staff so i wouldnt doubt if mm had a hand in that as well we did actually almost start up a sfa  american version  that mm immediately tried to take control of a few years back so i guess it finally came to fruition in some way
  i care
  one of the reasons i come to /cgl is lolita drama so dont speak for mebecause i care     ladies please continue
its looking like were not going to get any a list guests they just announced rosemarie seoir which always looked like overpriced larme tat
  another one that cares been on a hiatus from online comms forever but this whole thing has me hooked
  next itll be jetj because all the guests are friends with the british organizer not big on these guests but some will be
  they already had jetj in amsterdam
  they need good guests or everyone will be all told you so it was a flop so i wouldnt be surprised if they get more
  how will it be a flop if tickets sell out so fast
  if you only have 180 tickets does it matter how fast they sell out
  thats why its funny because theyve had all those guests before atepie forever and rms tf in paris and imai kira in barcelona so jetj would be yet another old guest
  so maybe this is their way of letting ye veteran lolitas relive the special moments of the four previous sfe events by combining them together for one magical trip down memory lane
  it does matter because it determines interest but we also know it is more than that       this is one of the few valid complaints i have seen here it seems old hat to pull the same guests now to be fair to dont think ate pies designer has been a guest their brand has sold many times at these things
  not to burst your bubble but from what ive been told those ticket numbers are accurate
  for saturday or sunday and where do you get that info if the sun numbers are that whats the venue
  i was hoping to see someone new or at least a brand that we havent seen very often at eu events i cant help but feel like theyre holding back a big name some of the organisers were excited about a guest they couldnt name so maybe theres more news to come
  those brands/guests were at omnia vanitas and under the sea both they are returning guests because they had a good worthwhile experience at previous sfe events they were never considered the main guest at any sfe event the only difference i think its that atelier pierrot used to send a random staff instead of designer
    i really hope so because im the absolute opposite of excited about this but i doubt it since they announced 4 guests already
  this as someone who went to one of their previous events i think theyre trying to do a best of for their 5th year anniversary nothing wrong with that but the lack of transparency is saddening
  you totally can talk to them a little during the event mostly to compliment coords and swap social medias and then act super excited and talk to them a lot during the afterparty done instant event friends
  sell me ur ticket if ur that disappointed
  random stuff ashizawa was in barcelona as well
  nayrt but ive never been able to go to the afterparty
someone thats good at summarizing that feels up to the task of creating a new thread
guests are simply disappointing behaviour of sfe is even more than that really thought of going to the event cos i was able for presale but i felt it isnt worth it maybe they are doing a best of but i had love to see new guests moreover i would have chose more interesting best of guests 
  both of you bitches are crazy and sm youre definitely bat shit no wonder no one in la will hang out with you except for one or two peopleyoure such a drama monger where ever you go so while i didnt agree that you got banned at first now see why find something to do besides bitch on here you nut

  can i get a link for the heart rosette
  link to shoes please
    corset     rosette     the store that sells the rosette also made other super cute ones but they are all sold out fucking rip
    thanks
i remember seeing a glass bottle lolita purse in a taobao store a while back but i forget which it was made of seethrough but iridescent pvc material i remember the display picture had an usakumya shoved inside the bag if anybody knows what store it was i would really appreciate it
  gorgeous haul
reposting my haul      great taste can i get a link to the heart bag shoes and the dresses from the top row
  could you link to the fuzzy beret and the cat jsk please also very nice haul anon
  shoes from iris corolla       heart bag     top row dress from shimotsuki sakuya      probably have to hold out for spot for the shoes  jsk
  thanks the beret is the softest thing ever i recommend it     beret     and the jsk is an apron but ill link both versions    apron     jsk 
express shipping 888 cny  what the fuck does this mean the item is unavailable or are they serious
  i doubt theyre serious it probably means they dont ship to that area since if the item was unavailable then usually the seller would put 999 or similar as the price

  thank you so much anon youre a lifesaver
is there a shopping service thats able to use something like those space saver bags i want to buy a ton of stuffed toys but shipping them without being compressed would be expensive
  hi sorry i didnt see it until now ill start with the dress     im a 86cm bust and 72cm waist and i bought the dress in a 1 yard and the white colourway the shirring has a lot of give and i feel its a bit loose on me the material is also very lightweight so it has stretch in general its a loose dress so i guess its not suited for smaller people at the same time it wrinkles easily ive steamed the dress before wearing it and you can still see the creases     i do like the dress but id have to wear it in summer my main gripes are the wrinkling and creasing but the shoulder straps are adjustable and removable so thats nice the bandana i ordered too is super cute
  i ordered two bags  one in pink and one in milk tea the pink one is for a friend and i dont want to remove the packaging so ive left it out     for the price 35 aud im kind of on the fence for this one its a nice bag i love the design and the small bits are cute but comparing it to the one i got for my friend  theres a couple of things worth a complaint     the straw wasnt cut as straight as my friends bag there were some loose plastic on it before i removed them there are also some pen marks which i havent tried to wash out yet and there is some white paint specks on the inside of the bag behind the window there are some marks on the window too but it was hard to catch them on photograph    itll need a bit of a clean but its a good product not too big and not too small the design is just too cute so im in love with it i feel like the bag i got was a bit of a miss because my friends came in perfect coniditon
  are you pregnant or wearing a cupcake petti or is the dress cut just bad it makes you look preggo/ im guessing maybe the pleats and the wrong type of petti can you try an aline
  could you please link the first black blouse with short sleeves
  youre welcome i have a couple pairs from each of the first two stores and 2 pairs of the nawdu meow ones in different lengths and am really happy with all of them
i may have gone a little overboard
  i am wearing a cupcake petticoat in the picture i also dont have much space between the mirror and where im standing so that might be why it looks so weird haha     i dont have my aline on hand  but i agree i think the dress doesnt look good with the petticoat i used im definitely waiting until i get the right petticoat when i wear it out
  the heart brooches are from cirith ninniach they make beautiful intricate accessories and headdresses ill probably coord them with marias catholic nun or something similar     mauve dress is from dollhouse      apron from your highness   
im so excited this is my first order in maybe 34 years i couldnt afford to buy many clothes while in college and now i can make all the orders i want
    thanks for reviewing are the sides of the bag clear too or only the front i think the reflections are making my brain confused
  thank you so much i kept thinking about this this morning hoping it didnt come off as rude so thank you for taking it well i really only wanted to know because i like the dress but it looked too wrong in the picture and i was curious to know if it was the petti or something else or the construction thanks
  could you please post the link to the cute rabbit jacket so cute please post when you receive
  link to the sleep mask at the bottom its absolutely adorable
  no one else has this issue
  
  it happens to me sometimes due to heavy traffic so i try firefox and after refresh it everything shows
there is literally nothing wrong with blouseless or shoulderbaring lolita coords
dumping examples to critique
  critique  these types of threads make me think of normie cunts who get together to look celeb gossip magazines  such trash
  i think this all looks cute and wonderful i believe any style can be loose with its limits
      appreciation and adoration is also acceptable
unpopular opinion i dont think blouseless coords look good im not trying to scream teh rulez1 but it gives off a normie vibe a blouse makes it look more polished    i also dont want to get body oil and sweat all over the bodice of the dress
      it all depends on how it is coorded imo      i think yours is the popular opinion do not worry    however what do you think about not wearing a blouse beneath an op if hygeine is your issue with blouseless jsks surely a trapped armpit in an op has more contact with the dress than an exposed one in a blouseless jsk and the bodice of the op is otherwise equally skintouching as the blouseless jsk
  depends on the jsk some do sit right under my arm pit and thats true about ops and the main reason i dont wear them id rather throw a blouse into the wash than run the risk of ruining an op or jsk from having it touch my skin
  what is an undershirt
      that makes sense
  finally pic related is a borderline case what do you think should there be sleeves here
  looks like a minisleeve op so id say no but thats my opinion
  this is perfect now ill have to find this jsk
  ruining an op  i just wash my dresses  whats wrong with you
i notice with the ones that work they tend to be wearing something else on their arms/hands for balance
why do i feel like the only people who care enough to create these threads have an armpit fetish
  probably because you harbor weird fetishes of your own
  i hate the plain black tights and underskirt it would look so cute with ankle socks
  that collar  why
  it lacks balance when the shoulders are not covered we have rules for a reason ita trash
  armpit fetish   thats gross  i live blouseless coords for summer also a lot of them here look very elegant
  not really    theres a lot of guys on here with an armpit fetish sadly
jetj looks good without a blouse most of the time
  ddlg
  if you are in new england pls add     anonn 9960     we can talk lolita 
    why is fanny so lovely
if you can wear a damn wig then wear a fucking blouse  ugh  i only like blouseless coords in rarewell executed cases like some itt and if the straps of the jsk have a ruffle or are minisleeves
  like in brand photoshoots such as pic related
  i also dont want to get body oil and sweat all over the bodice of the dress    serious question why do people think this a blouse doesnt prevent sweat nor oil from coming on the dress it may appear that way because the blouse gets shocked first but even if you barely sweat it will go through the fabric of the blouse you need to wash it regardless
  and an op without a blouse will be worse off than a jsk with a blouse as far as body contact goes
  fit is atrocious
  okay in summer and with bare legs with tights and otks it looks unbalanced even worse when theyre opaque      looks so much better on her than on that sissy
i like all the coords from above and also tried coording dresses w/o blouses but never wore the coords out because not wearing a blouse makes me feel uncomfortable af it feels like im almost naked or as if id run out the house in just swimwear or sth
brands have always done blouseless shoots
the blouse rule was created by girls with fat upper arms and shoulder acne
  it wasnt its actually based more on japanese norms for fashion you dont often see people exposing their shoulders/armpits in public lolita fashion did start as a rebellion against that sort of norm in japan though
  also probably based in part on the historical influences for the fashion i would expect
  you make it sound like your skin is covered in fabricdissolving acid or something
any old school styled blouse less looks bit more like op
  not sure if this counts but here
  pretty sure this is an op though
  just bearly
awww thanks for this thread anon 3 i wish people wouldnt make all this fuss about not wearing a damn blouse sometimes it looks perfectly okay and sometimes its just hot and no im not going to wear a bolero if its 40 fucking c degrees
  what the fuck is this
  a troll
happy birthday have more shoulders
a lot of these dont look like lolita at all
  its because despite being an alternative style 99 of the people online coord the exact same way
  a lot of them look like lolita though issue is usually dress isnt poofy enough or too simple looking making it look like a sundress
  doesnt look lolita just artsy     same as above    dear god    honestly jetj is barely lolita even with a blouse     just looks like a fancy ballgownesque dress not much like lolita at all    crosses the border from ero into just being nonlolita gothy    classy but not lolita    rest of outfit us too normie its a glorified sundress
  if you have issues with no blouse then get out from this thread nobody cares about your salty comments
  but i like all the rest of the pictures in the thread thinking some of these are bad examples doesnt mean i have a problem with the concept
  cute but that wig really ruins it for me c she doesnt have any white in her coord too
  im not into the wig either but since when do people directly color match wigs to their coords if you had a blue dress would you wear a blue wig
  ahah honestly yes i love blue but jokes apart you definitely dont need to match a naturalcoloured wig for unnaturalcoloured wigs i think things are different especially if the wig is very fluo/saturated it can really clash with everything else and look out of place like it does in  if its your real hair then okay but if you went as far as to wear a wig at least wear a matching one well this is just my opinion though and im sure there are exceptions where it looks good
  i like this one a lot that bag is amazing
  make your own thread for your little opinion
  crit and discussion is great imo
  is that a younger and fatter fannie rosie
some more      no
heretics what about the rulessss
  i like this one a lot
  thats ugly af and also not lolita theres a line between tealength and this monstrosity
sorry anon but almost all of these are justbad like they scream i learned about lolita from that one time nikki minaj wore it and normies trying to wear it who are too used to revealing skin in every outfit theyve worn before the balance just feels offthese dresses were mostly made with the assumption that a blouse would be under them so they look disproportioned without them
  like this looks fine it comes off as a summer dress but most dresses with prints and extra bows/frills just look so unbalanced without a blouse especially when most blouseless cords seem to opt for short socks its like a a pepperoni pizza where all the meat is clustered together in the center of the pie and nowere else  theres too much going on in the torso and nothing to break it up few dresses in this thread balance the lack of a blouse properly rules are bullshit you can bend them theyre just general guidelines for what tends to be pleasing with the overall style im not entirely against blouseless when theyre like the picture i quoted but most arent if youre going to wear it as a summer dress give it the vibes if one otherwise youre just a sponge cake that someone got too lazy to frost completely oh and in many unfortunate cases youll pull off the daddy gives me cummies and i charge 10 a minute vibe perfectly because of how these dresses are many to emphasize blouses and without that they just emphasizecollar bones and sleek shoulders and such
reading through this thread just confirmed that i hate lolita without a blouse unless it has an interesting feature like  or   it looks really normie and not cute or elegant
  yeah this thread has been goldstar fap material and these girls dont even realize it
    gross
does anyone know where to get armor patterns or how i want to try out making gs armor for next year and been wondering if theres any pattern out there
previous 
so does this mean that vm is going to start making things in nonana sizes
  nonana sizes  they arent sized that small besides theyre more likely to want to branch into the chinese market more where it wouldnt be necessary to increase their sizing
  their sizes are totally normal the main limitation for the average westerner is bust size but there are many pieces with 90 cm bust
  they made some fully shirred pieces last year and theyve been making partial shirred things for ages
flying fuck on lm  
looking for babbys first ap petti and ended up with this pretty somehow i like it better than organdy petti but i worry about the poof because from stock photos it seems really nonexistent can gulls give any reviews on this also would highly appreciate any pictures of this worn underneath
  people only want this because it has silly english i feel sorry for their flop taste
  i feel sorry that youre too poor to buy a meme shirt for funsies
  le ebin swear words stopped being funny in middle school randomchan
    just let people have fun anon its their money anyway not yours
  vm sizes are pretty normal i wonder are wunderwelt taking them over like what happened with moitie if so i hope they dont start doing any shitty anime collabs just to stay afloat that miku moitie thing is burned into my brain forever
  i find the shoulders limiting even when my bust size was 88cm the vm op i got didnt fit because of that
posted the translations the first 4 prototype chapters of that kera manga  
  okay i have decided to allow you to have fun
  wunderwelt didnt take over moitie lmao
  are you dumb wunderwelt bought moitie
  wunderwelts parent company bought moitie but yes close enough
  holy shit its happening
    its not close you might as well say a mountaineering brand bought wunderwelt and moitie its just dumb lol
  literally why would you buy a brand petti
  not being a gold star lolita  not having brand everything  cosplayers i tell you
  my bust size is 86 its my 36 shoulders i have problems with nothing on their site right now caters to that
  looking at the photo alone its nonexistent youre going to have to layer up with it
    thats not really an ana issue so much as a bone structure issue so tired of anons being like you need to have a bmi of 12 to fit into vm its meant for healthy asians not big boned europeans because well its a japanese company
  tfw 80cm bust  tfw 61 cm waist  tfw 37 cm shoulders and 174 cm height  why even live
    theyre cute and comfy and get the job done  t own pic related in two colors
  i have a black one its soft and very comfortable but not for giving lots of poof i wear it on more casual days
  i dont wear vm but i have 40 cm shoulders and an 82 cm bust most of my blouses and ops have 35 cm shoulders listed but because of my bust they look fine on me if they have small shoulders and bust though i look fucked
  really ive religiously avoided buying ops because im terrified they wont fit tell me is it uncomfortable at all for the ones that fit ive been looking at metas tailor bear op it has a shirred bust but the shoulders are 34 cm is that simmilar to something youd be able to fit in comfortably pic related
  bless you
  why would you not buy brand bloomers and petti unless youre a pheasant
  my thoughts exactly
  im fucking dying
which burando has the warmest coats suitable for extreme winters im freezing gulls
  they all suck desu but just look at the wool content more wool  warmer
  speak for yourself my wool ap coat has me toasty as fuck even in torrential rain
  not sure if suitable for extreme winters but mary magdalene used to have the best coats high percentage of wool or even angora wool is what you are looking for also that the outer layer itself isnt too thin
  i use a cape on top of my coat
  extreme winters  rain
  well which coat
  i have a meta coat that is wool and stands up to new england winters but it has no pockets
    mm long coats    i have one with a hood and cant wait to trial it       layering up has me looking kawaii instead of a normie marshmallow in 0f weather i wear an undershirt and thermal tights under all my clothes during winter
  wool  wool is great in rain anon dont be stupid/
  how extreme are we talking  ive been pretty comfortable in my baby coat in polish winters wouldnt wear it in severe weather/below 5 c though
does anyone know where the idea of rectangle headdresses came from as in timewise
  no idea but heres mary philbin wearing one
  thanks anon im curious as to what they were called in times past or was it just rectangle headdress time for a bit of research
so everyone off of tumblr right backed up your posts onto your harddrive right
  nayrt but youll find results under variously brain binder bed bonnet and bandeau
  cont   heres a link with more images of one similar to this pic  
  nayrt but t b h i have a 94cm bust and i fit comfortably in a good handful of ops including magic amulet i bind sometimes to get that good lolita silhouette but i rarely have issues even with broader shoulders and a larger chest i even have an easier time fitting into older ops somehow
      my dumb ass didnt know until just now that rectangle headdresses were a thing before lolita fashion
  the korean indie brand baroques down coat looks pretty warm
  friend if some of the comments ive seen on rc are to be believed a lot of people dont seem to realize that dresses were a thing before lolita fashion dont sell yourself short
  exactly i am so sick of people complaining that vm is for anachans
    thank you so much that website has so many pretty things    i love historical clothing but sadly my selection is all slips from the 1940s at the moment i really want to pick up some older pieces but im a taller modern woman so finding things to fit is a bit difficult at least i also really enjoy bonnets and other headwear which is a great place to start    thanks again anons
is it just me or does anyone feel like fanny doesnt suit mmms aesthetic at all   they way they styled her just looks so bad she looks way better in her usual vintage shots
  i see what you mean shes still gorgeous but something about this just feels out of place very much unlike how harmonious her overall appearance looks when she wears her personal styles
    i think youre just accustomed to seeing her in a different style
  i agree she doesnt look as good as she usually does but i think its because of the styling with the right styling she could look amazing in moitie
  nah both the other shoot and this one makes her look almost dowdy  they lack the usual elegance of mmm
  speaking of mmm anyone else experiencing glitter fallout on their neo gothic arch print i handwashed mine and the glitter was all over the place    i emailed wunderwelt 3 times about it but they legit ignored all my emails im fucking pissed
    i think she looks really pretty and elegant but if it werent those chandelier earrings/pendant id have pegged this as excentrique and not moitie so i guess you do have a point    imo its not that shes not elegant but a western girl in a normal western hairstyle in western clothes  it just makes her look really normal like shed probably walk down the road and get a croissant with her coffee rather than hang out in cemeteries and make up stories about vampires which was the original charm of moitie if we just wanted olde timey western white girl clothes wed just get them from thriftshops or something theres no need to ship over a whole different aesthetic from japan    i think whoevers doing the styling is just kind of missing that element of overdone fantasy girlyness that made gothic lolita gothic and lolita if that makes sense like it needs overdone curls that is out of style or platforms that are ugly but cute or the kind of look thats goth in graveyard but also kawaii cute theyre just kind of really missing it with the elegant parisian girl look theyre going with    just my 2cents on the matter
  how 2 buy
  i think it suits her very well and i hope she does darker makeup more often are you sure its not just because youre not used to seeing her like this
  that always happens with everything with glitter on it you have to be very careful when washing glitter its weird wunderwelt isnt communicating with you though
  what does the print look like without glitter i really love that print and all the cuts but i hate glitter and gold so i didnt buy it
  i think its just bad styling they should style her like claudia from interview with a vampire open hair thick curls and all
  i dont think that the jfash part of tumblr cares they are not affected by the new tos and will most likely stay   i dont even know what sjws are going to do
  they are not affected by the new tos  i dont know about other jfash but the lolita fashion tag now brings up nothing because tumblr staff thinks its nsfw so it is actually affected even if not justifiably
  follow them on twitter lolita_baroque its a mto and they havent opened it up yet they just got the physical samples a few days ago for the store
  so sad abt the lolita fashion tumblr tag i could occasuonally find some pretty cool stuff there like art or obscure itas no longer i guess
  every blog with mention of lolita or lgbt is in danger
        the remaining people will probably abandon tumblrand go for either twitter or igprobably ig since the western community there its biggerbut i wish twitter was more widespread since it allows you to reshare content like tumblr  some other alternatives people are mentioning on tumblr are mewemastodon and pillowfortbut i doubt most lolitas will make accounts there  and of coursetheres facebook with cof and rc
  most of what i posted was scans and some translations so i will go to twitter with using livejournal as an archive
  youre just finicky

tfw no brolita bf edition
i want to quit my job so badly but it pays well and has lots of benefits like great healthcare and a lot of vacation time but the job itself sucks so much im considering going job hunting in 2019 but there is barely any work around here and things are always so competitive at least right now i can afford to travel and buy things to make myself feel better but some days i dont know if its worth it
man i just really love cosplay
i saw a lolita in a full coord today and it made me so happy im glad the fashion is still going strong and seeing her gave me some motivation ive gained some weight over the years so i cant fit my dresses properly anymore but after seeing her it made me realize i should finally get off my ass so i can wear the clothes i love again
im always broke when my dream dress gets posted and it always gets sold within a couple days and im used to it but it hurts extra this time
studying sugaring in cosmetics class  mfw a real honesttogod butthole inspection  i thought of you gulls
  put aside money for it
  keep job hunting on the back burner its going to take time to attend interviews and submit applications itll be something to look forward to thatll help you get through your work day i hope you find a job that fulfills your needs financially and otherwise
  i know im just currently paying for school myself once im done w the course ill be able to actually do that i hope ill be able to sooner rather than later
  please elaborate anon did everyone in class get their butthole inspected did the teacher act in place of a comm mother i have so many questions
  kek
  tfw no brolita bf edition    is there actually a safe way to find a decent gf that respects your hobby if you are from the other side of perspective or is it just like everywhere else go out into the world and try your luck asking unironically since i have zero dating experience
  tfw a girl in your comm becomes too instafamous for the crew and you all have to tpose on that little thottie to lower her social status
  a woman came in and everyone watched as she had her anus tended to by the teacher
lolitas deserve great big hugs
  that feel when crazed bitches cry about only getting detached nerds as bf    oh boy i guess its because normies dont understand aight not like that people with at least the lowest of standards wont put up with nutjobs
  i think you meant 
  generally i find most people meet each other through mutual interests like work friends school or hobbies    then again ive been single for over a year the only reason i got with my last girlfriend was i accidentally messaged her over facebook back in the time where you just added random people and it turns out she was the younger sister of a girl i knew    ive had experiences with other girls since but none of them seem to want commitment its the same cycle  girl acts friendly towards me  me being a sperglord cant tell if its flirty or genuine friendliness just assume friendliness to be safe  usually get asked out on a friendly date or if we are going out as a group like drinks after class the girl will usually find an excuse to seperate me from everyone else  add alcohol  girl forces themselves onto me  just go with it and have fun  couple days later ask if they would like to go out on a date a real one  immediately get flaked on    its difficult to find girls who are  1 attractive   2 okay with my degenerate fantasies and strange hobbies  3 have degenerate fantasies and hobbies of their own aka not a basic bitch  4 attracted to me   5 actually want commitment     sigh pure suffering
  sugaring  im interested how permanent is it typically
  its not its a bit like waxing
  i meant like how long typically does the hair stay off  its a bit like waxing  ehh and more expensive than waxing i imagine
  this is what i mostly fear since i have been toying with the idea of dating women ive always been bi curious but could never act on it because most of the girls i would actually sleep with have awful personalities or i just have nothing in common with them
nobody will ever want to do cute couple cosplay with me and im going to die in burando
i just found out that one of my teachers is into lolita and im not sure how to feel what if shes browsing this board right now i feel so conflicted
tfw not enough free time to make the outfit i want  tfw outfit online is needlessly expensive  tfw really want it  torn between spending a ton of money or a ton of time on a basic bitch cosplay i want pic related  wat do seagulls    spoilerim male/spoiler
man i just really love costhots
  she doesnt even had a good body type for that outfit fuck
i passed a group of lolita on ild and one of them gave me the shit eye it made me feel kind of bad because i was looking at them while walking by to see which dresses they were wearing i didnt wear a coord on saturday or say anything so i probably looked like an invasive normie
  why feel conflicted shes an adult shes allowed to have hobbies and passions outside of her profession
  she might have also just had resting bitch face i always look like im side eyeing people but thats just how i look man
   now that youve posted that i actually have a constant rbf too we probably did it to one another simultaneously
  youre completely right i suppose its just the same feeling as whenever you see a teacher outside of their job more power to her i cant find any pictures of her coords though and i want to see them id imagine she looks quite nice
think about how im going to work on a cosplay all the time when im out of the house  the moment i come back i lose desire and get anxious about working on it    its been a while since i last drafted my own patterns sure but it shouldnt be this tough to just start up again ffs
  ah i see what you mean as for her coords she either keeps separate social media profiles to keep her personal life away from her professional image assuming she posts coord pics online at all
  idk man let me tell you that was me in march good pay amazing benefits the company would get us gifts like raffles at meetings and ice cream trucks and sometimes take us to all expensive paid baseball games or bowling events however the coworkers were shitty and abusive in my department and were hard to get rid of i quit when i became fed up and now im in a job where i work alone okay pay no benefits at all and nothing even remotely happens when its a holiday i still kind of regret leaving but i also sigh in relief at the fact that i dont have coworkers anymore you have to really consider the fact that you may end up somewhere without any benefits and lower pay and accept that if you can then youre ready to move on

i went over my recent coord pics and it looks like im shrinking everything is starting to become loose and baggy but i still feel fatter than ever i used to be few kilos if any overweigth shed the extra and a bit more and in the summer i decided to try and go for my final goal weigth lowerish but still normal i havent been this skinny in years but i feel fat sometimes i feel like i have a huge fat belly and my body feels so floppy and disgusting i feel like i dont make any process or even like im gaining weight i feel likeim counting my calories wrong and i just cant make myself go with less anymore then i put on something from my wardrobe and i feel so confused am i going into fucking psychosis or what lost my measuring tape so i dont have solid proof of this and its making me crazy
  you have solid proof you just listed it all out if clothes are baggy theyre not going to magically stretch out because youre fat and even if you are counting wrong 20 calories up or down doesnt make a difference in the long run you can see yourself get thinner you feel yourself getting thinner thats because you are and you should probably get help if it doesnt convince you idk steal a measuring tape from a department store or something
  i havent been this skinny in years but i feel fat sometimes i feel like i have a huge fat belly and my body feels so floppy and disgusting i feel like i dont make any process or even like im gaining weight  sounds like body dysmorphia maybe get help it could potentially turn into a problem
  i am sorry you are not chad
  studies have found that the more you lose weight the more your body image the way you see your body in your mind gets distorted that goes for an people but also healthy ones i hope knowing this can help you feeling better sometimes our brains a little shit     i also lost weight to the point of being underweight but still healthy and i also feel disgusting and fat sometimes being thin doesnt mean you cant still have fat in you i dont have any muscle so my thighs are not the best for example loving yourself is not easy give it all your best anon
im disliking my cosplay class more and more many of them act in an obnoxious dudebro ish way and everyone try to distance themselves from me i got no friends at this school  also havent had motivation to work on cosplays in a long time so just wasting my time in class doing nothing
oh and i wish i could wear some of these clothes i see on /cgl/ or get into cool fashion in general or even the kimono thread makes me feel jealous that i can never wear nice clothes like that  sometimes i get cool ideas for crazy fashion concepts i just wish i were really good at fashion and could wear it and totally understood old school harajuku style and make totally new harajuku directions  even looking at this stuff makes me sad that i can never wear it
tfwno bf
  why can you never wear it if you can wear sweats and a tshirt you can wear whatever you like from a suit and tie to a mishmash of doilies and potholders
ive been raised a rich kid my family has always been well off yet among my siblings i have become the most stingy of the bunch at the same time ive come to accept and expect good makeup for my shit skin to cost 50 which also lasts me virtually forever ive never finished any makeup because i used it so little while i grew up more on this later but in some sort of twisted sense ive been ashamed of my rich background and adopted the outlook of im not rich my parents are rich in certain situations ive lied about which part of town i live in because the one i do is well known to be full of oldmoney snobs    this ild i slept over at a friends place which did lead me to see some of my commfriends without makeup for once this sweet girl bunny who i knew from other situations before joining lolita myself was complaining about the dark circles around her eyes i got a little sad and tried to cheer her up by saying that her problem is at least fixable with concealer she admits thats true but then went on how the concealer she needs is 30 or something i almost hope i misheard and so exclusive she usually asks to get it as a christmas gift each year i didnt comment on it but 30 thats nothing if its makeup which works well and is essential to your facial fulfilment    im feeling anxious because even if i dont know bunny all that well i do want to become her friend she has been at my house in the rich neighbourhood but i dont know much about her financial situation now im fretting that in time ill come to realise shes terrible with money or just has a completely different framework than i do she has been immensely supportive of me getting into lolita and complimented me of getting good at it so fast or never having an itaphase and jokingly surpassing her so fast i laugh it off but it is bothering me is money the whole question will it matter    i dont know i might just be rambling thanks for listening
  while i dont know what it feels like to be well off i can understand how some people look down on others for being in a lesser place but think about it anon if you like a person if you are friends with them and enjoy being around them why should their life situation matter so much try to work on being unjudging in such matters and just accept someone for who they are if you like that person and that part of them thats all that matters     i recently watched a documentary about domestic servants in the 1800s and a lot of that had to do with class hierarchy both between the household vs the servants but also between the higher up servants and the lower there was one instance of one of the family members actually getting to know their servants most of the time they were to stay as separate as possible even as far as having hidden passageways so the servants were as far away from the house members as possible and found out that they were just as complex of people as her family members they just had a different experience in live due to random luck of being born to lower class people which of course meant that they had lesser opportunities for growth and enrichment in general but did not mean that they could not be the same or even better than those in a higher class personality/moral/etc wise    sorry for rambling you post just got me to thinking please give bunny a shot you can still be her friend despite her upbringing and lot in life
  im a male itd look terrible and its not socially acceptable at all
  just know if she ever asks you to give her a dollar to hold youre never seeing that money again and youre buying your friends rather than having a not walked on relationship
  ill come to realise shes terrible with money  if she was terrible with money she would buy a bag full of expensive makeup then cry about having to eat only bread crumbs for a month  she just has priorities that are different from yours
  i can totally relate with 30usd being too much for makeup some of us just dont have enough money to spend it on every thing they like for example i prioritise manga and fashion i cant afford makeup in addition to my other two hobbies so 30usd would be too much for me    i would never shame someone for being rich although i would judge them harshly for throwing money away like it were toilet paper well anyway i think some friendships are stronger than different status especially if you have a shared passion like lolita at the same time most relationships just cant develop well when two people dont have the same means because they live in two completely different worlds what you give for granted i work hard to obtain my worries probably have never crossed your mind     i used to be best friend with a boy his family had more money than mine but not by that much we used to see each other every week end after some years his dad took a very important job and now theyre rich our families still see each other but me and him have lost contact i maybe see him once a year it really saddens me that we cant be friends anymore hes changed a lot growing up which maybe is another think i should take into consideration     i still wish you good luck though
  im poor but i would definitely give back all the money i was lent i probably would not ask in the first place but whatever are you a rich kid that detached from real life or just stupid
  im poor but i would definitely give back all the money i was lent i probably would not ask in the first place but whatever  well thats goo  are you a rich kid that detached from real life or just stupid  trying to domineer me with a loaded a or b question is classic manipulation do you need a dollar to hold from a kind person whose ego you deem is fragile sorry youre poor but maybe if you didnt spend like shit and got an actual job and saved money you wouldnt have to lash out like this at some kind of self perceived deficit of your personality for being poor you can fix yourself without being a leech
  thanks for the lesson freud ive never felt more understood in my whole life
  you should take it to heart youre a terrible human being and its your inability to learn from your actions thats causing it
  i like how you both called her out for lashing out on you and still called her a bitch /cgl/ never disappoints me
  then we were both rambling haha it seems that documentary was well made and i agree with the message you claim they conveyed even if we have different backgrounds were all fully fleshed out people theres a lot i really like about bunny shes got a great sense for any kind of fashion is truly passionate what she cares about and her laugh has such a pure joy in it our senses of humour are carefully gaining ground to understand each other and so far we really seem to match besides were still young and studying maybe when we get older with full time jobs and our own economy we might end up on the same level      ive never heard her complain publicly or obnoxiously thank you for sharing your thoughts its good to hear from people with different priorities especially from people like you  anon its a lot of things which beckons for spending and thinking about it there are many things i also feel is very expensive even if others throw countless hundreds on it each year i hope i can understand bunny and her priorities when we get to know each other better thank you for your wishes of luck stranger its moments like these which make me love /cgl/      none of my friends ever ask me for money like that however i have noticed that if im hosting anything at my house and buy food for it beforehand im really bad at asking my friends to split the costs thanks to my parttimejob im in a good financial situation and i know a bunch of my friends are not if i forget during the event i host because im busy having fun i feel like id be a downer to then hassle people for food costs afterwards so i just let it slide am i buying friends through food yet pic related
  am i buying friends through food yet pic related  typically if youre hosting it shouldnt be an issue the only time that ever comes up in my life is if theres a spontaneous pizza order if youre setting out food ahead of time like before they arrive expect for them not to pay for it as theyre guests if youre at a party at random and everyone could go for some take out food expect everyone to chip in hosting has more responsibility
  am i buying friends through food yet  i mean as a host providing food is a given and when i go to my friends house i bring food too since i have the means to do it ill do it splitting the costs when im not actually hurting for money sounds kinda cheap honestly as long as your friends arent specifically trying to be in your company for the sake of nice food i think its fine     i would consider myself middle class by the way familys household income is around 200k
  you really seem to care for that girl i think when one puts in that much effort its hard not to reciprocate and keep being friends especially if youre already liking each others company if that guy put in that much effort to still be my friend i think we would still be in touch today no need to thank anon it makes me happy to read youre trying your best at being a good friend
  yes
  ill be your new money bf
    alternative fashion in general is hardly socially acceptable as it is even teenagers who you would think would get a bit more leeway for experimenting get shit for it  there are plenty of guys into jfash even the colorful styles like fairy kei and decora wear what you like anon life is too short look up style guides look at street snaps try experimenting with your look do it for your own happiness than anyones approval and you can get there    i just wish i were really good at fashion  most people arent naturally born fashionistas its a learned trait its true that some people simply dont have an eye for aesthetics but you have ideas of your own and thats a start just go for it live your best life
  come on dont say this anon tons of harajuku styles look good on guys you need some effort and courage though is there a particular style you like
  i dont know how your reading comprehension is doing but i never asked for a money bf be careful where you say that though atmkun
  holy shit kill me i needed a hungry seagull but didnt notice the unholy watermark for 9gag heres a clean version
  the perils of using google for reaction images instead of having an external hard drive from years of casual downloading for your reaction images
  all my previous reaction images come from such a collection they just didnt have a hungry seagull which i then had to go find i agree though i hate not having the images i need its the reason i keep collecting
  if im hosting anything at my house and buy food for it beforehand im really bad at asking my friends to split the costs  is that really a thing where are you from if you invite people to your house you dont ask for financial compensation for the food and drinks not beforehand not afterwards not ever if you want to split costs go to a restaurant seriously i hope its just a cultural difference otherwise i dont know wtf is wrong with you
  actually the only rich family i know is exactly like that they ask financial compensation for everything im sure they would ask compensation for letting guests use their toilet if they could get away with it
  was joke namely about disappointing your parents by dating new money  feel flat oh well
  your post comes across as massively detached from real life i grew up poorer than my friends and as we grew up the comments they made about my house the clothes i wore and the differences between our lives really fucked with my head for a long time i wasnt under the poverty line or anything just way poorer than the girls i was friends with     in the end their money didnt magically make them a better person than me everyone has their personality flaws maybe she doesnt mamage money well but youre not perfect either thats just how the world is and plus i agree with what the other anon said if she had money handling issues she would have bought it anyway i know you think youre not looking down on her but you massively are if i found out a potential friend had written something like this about me id be disgusted i hope for your sake she doesnt read cgl     30 on makeup isnt much for you but it would be for me however maybe theres something that id spend 30 on that youd think would be frivolous i suppose i always ask for a certain perfume for christmas but someone else might not think spending 80 on a perfume is a lot its just priorities id rather spend that 80 on a jsk or going out with friends its really not that deep pls stop having a martyr wank over this
  you literally got so mad over an anon asking if you were a detached from life rich kid    this response solidifies the fact that you are
  i thought we moved on from that feelings hurt
  unfortunately for you no im fine with my place in life you however seem unsure of yours and your inability to not reply to anyone who vaguely critiques you really does prove that  have a nice day
  well at least theyre rich and dont need to call people detached or stupid to feel better about themselves and their situation
  i forgot that were all just jealous of you little rich girl go make some friends like a normal person and stop fretting over concealer on cgl
    nayrt but they came to /cgl/ to get asspats about their quite frankly not very relatable story enough said
  complaining about being called detached or stupid  on my 4channel are you lost thats pretty mild
  uh im not  and shes not  who was actually extremely nice  you literally just confirmed you cant read and you hate rich people and im assuming its because youre poor congrats
        why are you samefagging so much
    graduating and getting a good internship  thought id be haunted by ghosts until the day i decided to quit the cgl life  now transitioning to lifestyling  person that tried to ruin my reputation for years now works a dead end job and does nothing with their degree killed their chances by doing costhot shit  karma working its magic
  extremely nice  yyou must be samefag1   not that im going to post my paycheck or anything but if you could read youd know that im happy with my part in life not poor and even if i was your point is still moot and i assumed you were the same poster because there cant be two people who are this retarded      only one of those posters is me nice try
  as the mean girl out of those two posts please do not pretend to be me i meant what i said to someone i didnt think would spam like a crossboarder multiple posts per ten minutes 
  first of all where am i pretending to be you second of all what the fuck do you mean people watch threads are you dense
  i didnt say you were samefagging are you ok  isnt  look at the reply chain      uh did you misquote i only posted  those first two quotes are insulting me and the fourth one is insulting the other anon
    theyre thinking were one person arguing with ourselves or theyre mad that they are losing and are now screaming samefag i guess it works every time tho so i dont blame them
  would all one of you please go back to /r9k/
  im a lolita though      im not sure who you are but now im mostly concerned over the retard who interjected into the argument screaming samefag
  if you were you wouldnt have to prove yourself by saying you were you would just ignore you are bait at this point so no more yous
  i have nearly 90 brand main pieces but ok thanks for the yous
  ive been chuckling at this for 5 mins now jolly good reply anon
  my friends and i used to do this when we were at uni the person whose place we were at wasnt so much the host as they just happened to have the most convenient house on a particular night which mostly came down to location and whether there were any family members expected to be home since this usually resulted in the same few hosting it wouldve been unfair to always place the burden on them
  i can understand that but still in that situation in my country we would bring a gift/bring food/dessert/drinks instead of literally paying someone
  im not going to assume what country youre in but in the off chance were in the same north american area polite guests bring something to be consumed at the party hosts make sure there is more than enough there beforehand so usually the hostess runs out of alcohol and has to clean puke from their kitchen only twice that night but has 30 bags of cool ranch and nacho cheese doritos that the vast majority has brung to make up for it
who am i what do i even want out of life
  you are you your name your being you want whatever makes you feel whole if you feel small know that you can feel big again
  hate my job  pay is shit  no vacation no bennies of any kind  keep job hopping every few months to get a small raise  i have an asshole friend who makes big money and has 5 weeks pto and full coverage healthcare   im unironically both smarter than them and have a better degree  i understand school shooters     salty af fattychan     lady oscar  god tier taste marry him immediately    scam  how tf nigga go on craigslist and message people finding a rental is not difficult
  there wasnt always a direct exchange of money we might cover someones share of a taxi/uber buy them a drink etc but there was always an understanding that everyone would pay their share they were invariably very casual gatherings of close friends so most of those things you mentioned wouldnt have been appropriate ive always associated that stuff with more family oriented gettogethers im australian if it matters

  it is when your entire town burned down and 65000 people all need new housing competition price gouging desperate skeezy real estate investors trying to scare people into selling their lots and scams are super rampant right now please dont act like trying to find a place to live after a natural disaster is the same as finding a place to rent in a normal sitution

  i live in oroville i feel for you guys i honestly dont know how so many people have made it through this far without giving up are you thinking of rebuilding if you can   id love to buy you something off a wishlist or give you some money through paypal if youd like    pic related wall fire from walmart
  f u c k  h e r
  craigslist  the housing marking in the area has been almost saturated for years and 65 thousand people lost their homes in 8 hours thats not a situation that lets you just go on craigslist and message people
  is this their dog maybe i will watch gems now i like the dog
  thats very kind of you to offer i dont have any wishlist just yet but your kind offer warms my heart im still debating on trying to rebuild what i had or start fresh and use this as an opportunity to refine my style     we arent sure if we will rebuild yet it all depends on what insurance will pay wont know that until an adjuster looks at the property our zone isnt open yet so no one can go look i know you guys had a few scares in the last few years a fire and then the oroville dam almost breaking california infrastructure is a mess right now      as others have said california already had a housing crisis and this fire displaced a massive amount of people there are many using this as an opportunity to take advantage of those who are desperate    sage for mostly off topic
  its not socially acceptable at all  isnt that the reason why alternative fashion exists in first place defying social norms and expectations well unless you want to go for a cute normie look    dont chicken out jump into the cold and try something new anon life is too short to care about every minor thing im sure you can do it if you put your heart into it
    letting 12 year olds wear gstrings  they make gstrings small enough for a 12 year old  what the fuck happened to the world
  nayrt but girls get away with alt fashion a lot more than men fashion is perceived as a female orientated interest because girls in general care much more about how they look    there is a lot more stigma to a guy dressed in altfashion than a girl  hes gay  hes a weirdo  hes a try hard  hes an attention seeker  hes a wannabe  hes compensating  he wants to be x eg japanese    like of course girls in altfashion get criticism too but they get a lot more support mens fashion is very narrow just try going to a mall and go shopping for mens clothes the range is very very limited because men are expected to dress in a limited range of clothes    the only reason ive been brave enough to tackle the weird looks is unironically because of pewdiepie and him being more open with his fashion interests
  pewdiepie   love him dearly    also i would rather people think im deranged than have men making weird sexual advances bc they think im wearing something to be sexual or some shit
  because of pewdiepie and him being more open with his fashion interests  what are you some kind of faggliolociio
  i like his content he unironically helped me get through some shit times in my life especially when i was unemployed and i was burnt out after applying for jobs and all i could do was just think about how my money was running out and i was going to be homeless his videos offered me some time to just not think about stuff for a little bit    hes the only yt celebrity i follow anymore
  nayrt but what
  i feel u anon
  a faggliolociio like a putterpoontzmueschenhausener but less german and more italian
  are you sure it was him that helped youi mean you could have gotten the same effect from boogie2988s mayo munching adventures or jon trons return to nazi duct tape series
  i enjoy his personality
  fair enough im not one to be scorned in unrequited love
cosplay 6taro  too shy to ask to do any fun poses besides stand next to each other when i run into a jolyne
  unrequited love  i dont want his dick in my ass or anything
  i wasnt thinking that at all but you most assuredly were are you sure you dont want some blond bearded love on your brown town
  did any of them randomly jump on your back/dick
this is going to sound really petty and stupid but whatever i am looking forward to a con that will be next year one thing i wanted to do was participate in the cosplay games they always looked so fun but for many reasons i couldnt take part in the past for the next con however i got my outfit all ready and i am waiting to fill the form out until i heard from an acquaintance about the change in con staff this one girl who has been caught cheating in cosplay contests before is now in the staff organizing the cosplay games she can influence who gets in or not along with what they do it bothers me because she used me and others to get buddybuddy with the staff then takes credit for it all pretending that we dont exist sending her orbiters after anyone who tries to speak up thats the problem anyone she knew who knew or helped her she could simply could reject honestly it happened a few years ago and i realized being mad wouldnt get me anywhere i dropped it and moved on its stupid and petty to fuss over it as there are other cons with their games the con i was going to has there games as a big event big stage lots of people always enjoyable to watch everyones happy and having fun i just wanted to be there on stage for once   tldr attention whore cosplayer will not get the attention they want
  you want whatever makes you feel whole  and what is that is it what i decided to aim for i hope it is
  no need to be such a dick dude
  do you ever stop whining 
since everyone is bitching about jobs ill join in i have the best job i have ever had in my life up until now pay benefits coworkers everything is prefect except hours i have to work 60 hours most of the time with 80 hours during the busy season     i have been going hard at it for over a year but its starting to get hard i am starting to get worried that i will never be able to find a partner i cannot seem to focus on anything outside of work all of the joy seems like its left my life    a lot of other people have been leaving and i would feel bad since its a small rural company that cannot replace people easily although with each person that quits more work gets piled on me
finish doing my course in design recently   feel so ready to finally start working again and buy all the burando ive been wanting this whole year  not have much luck but fingers crossed  get a group interview at a call centre  beginner role aw yiss  go to interview to only spend 4 hours getting stomped on by people in their 40s who have been in the industry for their whole lives  feel genuinely embarrassed and dont understand why i even got the interview   tfw i just want to sew pretty dresses and wear cute clothes
  what about manga/webcomics/webtoons
recently get a dream dress  its aps toy fantasy op  fawn over it for a while  decide to try it on  zip wont go further than my waist  feel like crying  guess i need to slim a bit    the thing is i have plenty of room left to pull the zip together everywhere else but the waist on this op mainly at the join where the skirt meets the bodice seems a few cm smaller than usual and every time i successfully get the zip past that point i let go and it drops down again ive owned a fair few unshirred ap pieces from similar years and earlier and never encountered this issue before it just kinda sucks really
  ow  maybe its just shitty construction or something please stay safe dont get too much underweight for a single ap dress
  what makes you think shed need to be underweight
  not gonna lie to you lads im lonely as heck but atleast i know you guys are wholesome and deserve love
  thats not what i was implying i meant that if she needs she shouldnt do it
sad cause i dont have anyone to share this with
  i am embarrassed for you
  girls get away with alt fashion a lot more than men  youre not necessarily wrong but girls get shit for it too speaking as someone whos been wearing alt fashion for a very very long time we get told that were weirdos try hards wannabe japanese attention whores straight up whores people like to think that if a woman dresses out of the ordinary it means shes looking for attention specifically because shes a prostitute fun times not to mention the occasional physical harassment     if all this deters you from wearing alt fashion then by all means continue to admire it from the sidelines but imo youre wasting your life by not at least trying to follow your passions on the flipside of all the above plenty of people love and appreciate seeing something unique that brightens up their day even if they arent familiar with the fashion style youre wearing it makes life a lot more interesting and fun in general
  thank you for your kind concern anon im currently a healthy bmi of 22 and would only intend to try and lose a few cm off my waist just to help the zip up its possible i gained a little weight from a little extra festive eating so im not gonna sweat it too much as im pretty happy with my size already its just a real bummer my dress isnt zipping up it seems to have quite a nipped in waist compared to my other ops despite the lolibrary measurements being quite average for unshirred ap
  s a weirdo  s a try hard  s an attention seeker  s a wannabe  s compensating   wants to be x eg japanese  girls get all of these criticisms too people dont assume were gay unfortunately desu but they do assume its a sex thing
  hells yeah cheesecake factory the rest can go
  i havent read manga in a bit last one being that seven deadly sins one which was a boring rave master/every shonen ever clone     any shonen reccs anon
    i did say  like of course girls in altfashion get criticism too but they get a lot more support  people are more forgiving of girls being spontaneous with their fashion    i stopped wearing all my stuff for a while because i became very scared to after some old lady started to harass and berate me for wearing a black surgical mask pic related in a shopping centre telling me im a shoplifter and i shouldnt need to cover my face if im doing nothing wrong i told her its just a style choice and that im happier with the mask on because im not content with how the lower half of my face looks she walked off in a huff this was the first time anyone had taken a serious problem to me covering my face i even usually take it off if i need to speak to someone because i find it rude if i didnt couple minutes later she returns with a security guard and he tells me i need to take it off or leave so i chose to leave despite the fact i had done absolutely nothing wrong because i didnt want to give the bitch the satisfaction of seeing my face
  whats the waist measure for the op lolibrary says 70 cm is that accurate asking because im the same bmi as you and thinking of getting toy fantasy too
  how do you know have you worn alt fashion as a girl
  at least shes dying soon
  some normies are retarded like this were closely familiar with this and its not exclusive to any gender or even a specific fashion style i recall a post on egl on livejournal about a group of lolitas who were harassed and then kicked out of a mall in the us because security thought they were suspicious it sucks when shit like this happens but its just something you learn to live with when you decide to break through fashion norms
  but why were you scared of that old lady did you fear that she might hurt you or sexually assault you because thats how we feel when old men shout obscenities at us lift up our skirts ask us what kind of fetish were wearing etc
  i follow a lot of altfashion accounts of both men and women a simple look at follower counts is a good first indicator    i could never objectively prove women are more supported in fashion based pursuits but thats my feelings      im just a timid and shy person who doesnt like conflict i do deliberately avoid going on things like public transport or into rougher areas because i know people will get physical     i also know what my position looks like a 61 grown man in strange clothes with his face covered arguing with some old white haired grandma whos no taller than 5 no matter what is actually happening everyone around assumes im in the wrong thats why i couldnt reason with the security guard it doesnt matter if ive done nothing wrong im automatically in the wrong so i just accepted leaving    ive even had a woman grab her child and pull them over to the other side of her as i walked past them as if im going to just grab the kid and run because scary suspicious man in scary suspicious clothes    i just want to wear cool clothes and feel cool
  a simple look at follower counts is a good first indicator    actually since there are less men into altfashion you would pop out more thus getting your fair share of followers but anyway you sound very timid/anxious maybe youre right and alternative fashion is not for you anyway rheres a thread for supporting people like you not sure whether it saged though
  i couldnt name a single jfash couple where the boyfriend has more followers than the girlfriend usually the girlfriend has more followers by order of magnitudes i will say though girls tend to put a lot more effort into their social medias more regular posts more fan interaction better photos better coords/fits and personally i find girls fashion to be more interesting because theres more industry surrounding it therefore more pieces produced and more crossbrand opportunities guys just kind of use it as a look book or as a quasitinder to attract girls    i enjoy wearing alt fashion even if im just wearing it privately around the house i need to work on my confidence as an entire person not just confidence in the clothes i wear
i wish i could remember how to hare hare yukai i got drunk as shit at yama and wanted to impress some thots with it
  i got drunk as shit at yama and wanted to impress some thots with it    thanks for brightening up my day anon
  checked the only couple i know and the man has more followers i know a man with average at best clothes and ugly make up who gets tons of female followers thirst after him with a little bit of effort into his social media the other anon was right guys do stand out a lot more than girls do inside of the community and receive much more attention in my experience as a girl wearing lolita i can tell you outside of the community its not generally accepted at all i can symphatize the nasty comments and behaviour you get but you have to accept females get the same  if not worse because they are considered less intimidating  treatment from normies i hope you get over your anxiety though anon
  you have to accept females get the same  if not worse because they are considered less intimidating    nayrt i quote all your answer but this part so much we all get shit for dressing differently but if you are a guy its harder someone will make inopportune sexual avances and hit on you as a girl i get pretty scared when guys start saying obscene things just because im wearing a pretty dress its a very unpleasant situation to be in the only way a guy would get the same shit is if some guys tried making fun of me because they think hes gay but nowadays making fun of gays is more frowned upon than hitting on a girl imo
hey everyone holmats right around the corner whats everyone got planned    
  i planned absolutely nothing people would recognize bcs its not overwatch nor from a recent anime gonna add a chistmas hat though tis the season  anyhow its my first na/fl con how does getting pictures/shoots work over there do i have to plan stuff with photographers beforehand also does it cost 
  you can plan with some photogs before hand but theres always a good am of them wholl be there trying to get their name out there and are more than willing to take a few photos as well
been having a huge surge in my maid outfit interest so i thought maybe having a thread to see and share pictures would be fun      maid lolita and maid cosplay are both accepted  anyone know of any good places to purchase high quality but cute maid outfits  what do you like about maid styles  talk about your experiences with working in maidstyle service jobs maid cafes etc    just post maids thats all
  sadly the only maid outfits i have are from bodyline not saying they are the worst but they are definitely costume quality
has anyone ordered from milky ange they have some really cute items but i have never seen any of their things in person and occasionally they seem to be made of questionable quality items seeing as how they have been around forever and have lolita brand prices im assuming that is just due to pictures though
  i have seen some of their items on the secondhand market and it always looks really bad qualitywise i cant imagine why they ask brand prices for it
does anyone know of any maid instas to follow or any maid shops that sell quality goods     also for the maid instas i prefer actual maid looks and not really slutty/weeb shit maid cafes are okay if theyre quality maid designs/uniforms can be short and cute but prefer no cringy western maid cafes unless they are good
  some of their items are pretty wellconstructed but they are more cosplaygrade than anything their beginner maid outfits had differentcolored laces and that was a big nope    some candyfruit items look nice and are original designs so maybe look into those
  thanks anon i completely forgot about candyfruit
so my maid cafe group had a meeting the other day to start planning for our annual event one of the topics we brought up was typical japanese maid behavior we decided not to do the whole okaerinasai goshujin sama thing because that sort of overly cutesy and shy behavior doesnt go over well with western customers especially from nonjapanese maids do you agree or does that sort of behavior distinguish a real maid cafe from simply a casual cafe experience and if you agree what sort of behavior would appeal to western customers without you just becoming a standard waitress persona how should western maids preserve the maid cafe experience without being cringy and making customers uncomfortable
  are you able to go out and observe typical cafe barista behaviours as a barista with plenty of regulars knowing their name or simply asking their name makes them very happy perhaps there are other things that your local cafes and little restaurants do that you can pick up too giving them a choice upon entering the cafe would they like new read american or traditional read japanese service may also help customers feel more at ease and give them something they can control in the strange environment its as simple as asking booth or table sir you may need a staff member dedicated to greeting guests for this and have that staff member place a color coded tag on the table so that serving maids can serve them appropriately you cant please everyone of course looking polished and having decent coffee is just about all one can really expect from a good cafe
  formerly worked in a maid cafe and unless a cafe enthusiast is at your table just act like a server/yourself most newtocafe people dont understand or are putoff by fake cutesy personalities
genuine question not trying to sound like an ass why do maid outfits/jobs/cafes in particular appeal to you guys is it the anime trope the aesthetic the persona you can get into etc
  i actually really find the role of service to be a huge goal in my life im not sure why i really like the idea of being a maid to a master or a mistress taking care of things cleaning serving plus the aesthetic is really cute
  is it the anime trope the aesthetic the persona you can get into etc    id say all of the above maid outfits are cute and wearing them makes me feel cute and happy
  this pic is so adorable
  anyone know of any good places to purchase high quality but cute maid outfits    buy a solid colour lolita dress that fits the aesthetic  buy a cute apron  you now have one maid outfit in good quality and a lolita dress that you can coord or wear in a toned down outfit if youre not lolita
  ive never ordered from them personally but 23 years ago they were regarded as the best you could get
kinda random but does anyone reading this have any experience with actual livein maid work or something less weeb than a maid cafe unless it was an actual honesttogodnotweebycon cafe and a bit more upper scale than cheapo rentamaid domestic service
  the girls are cute the outfits are cute and it feels nice having a cute girl talk to you even if its just their job
  i have some milky ange shoes they are incredibly comfortable but super bland i throw some clip on ribbons on them and they look ok they have large sizes which is nice
do you have any cringy local maid cafes in your area im curious post em here if you got em
  just let people have fun anon someone actually cheers up in ways other than making fun of others
is anyone planning on going
i might go on saturday im trying to decide if i want to participate in the cosplay showcase event or not i have no idea what it is from the description on the website
i went last year and was completely underwhelmed it was small and crowded and none of the panels/guests seemed appealing to me personally
nc comic con seems to have been gutted by supercon it was growing pretty well up until last year when supercon came on the scene and then they also tried to keep people from cosplaying in the main hall and made up a bunch of other stupid rules    i doubt it will even exist in a few years i know a few people who popped in but it looked dead on arrival
are there any vlog series on the youtube where a person goes to conventions n shit n vlogs about it but its specifically aimed at steampunk stuff and cosplay shit like that
dude convention vlogs are everywhere try searching for yourself instead of being lazy
i did tho  couldnt find one specifically about cosplay and going to conventions aside from this one video that was like 6 minutes long  maybe im doing it wrong tho
  just found out how to tag ppl haha  im new to 4chan  sorry for my autism
imagine thinking a man could fall in love with you when there are so many better looking girls around
  tracy is probably dating chad though theres still hope
and then i saw the hands
now im a beleiver
last thread saged about a week ago  how was birmingham mcm im seeing drama on instagram about the competitions what are you gulls building over christmas any other drama need it to warm us over the winter months
what drama are you seeing about the comps just curious
  yeah i havent seen it either so id like to know
    me too all i heard was about a friend getting runner up
  havent heard anything either winners all looked pretty good to me
competition all looked good from what i saw no drama during the event about it or on instagram that ive seen so i dont know what op is on about s
did any gulls go to hyper japan this year i heard it was tiny this time and there was nothing much to do
christ all these brit threads built on drama
if drama involved creepy photographers press 1    if drama involved female cosplaying being stuck up bitches press 2    if drama involved lewis press 3
  hyperjapan is the one con i go to and it has declined drastically over the years i couldnt go this year but apparently it was awful this year such a shame
  are you new here thats all the britfag threads have ever been the same 10 salty cunts bitching its fun to lurk it
  been away for a while but that is quite sad then again we are built on miserable cunts
  you forgot to post discord doofus   
wales comic con  they oversold tickets and continued to sell on the door tickets despite being sold out not enough staff to control the crowds and the owner got so stressed he had a heart attack and currently in hospital printers breaking and people waiting 2 hours for photos to be printed and some photos have apparently been deleted because of corrupted data its a massive clown fiesta
  oh god please share more on the heart attack and the lost photos
  are there any pictures or general proof he actually had a heart attack you dont just decide to have one lol
  it was pretty tiny this year only one room and almost no stalls dealer friend of mine ended up losing money big time from it as it seems attendance was also way down    i hope july turns out better or the event is basically dead by next year
  what the actual fuck happened to hyper japan i bought a weekend ticket because the july event was phenomenal but it was an actual mess a literal third of the size as summer a handful of acts for the main stage and a tiny bunch of stalls which were mostly packed with obvious bootlegs how the fuck did that even happen
  costs go up venue gets more expensive insurance or whatever organisers attempt to downsize but unit costs still high for traders etc most people buy tat online now if at all if its based in london you have china town to compete with and they sell bootlegs openly its not cost effective to try and compete so they also just sell bootlegs at hj too     if you arent going for the culture/food/friends then the tat is less of a draw but you could just as easily meet up with your friends for free so no need to go either
lol duggan at it again with being an absolute twat now threatening girls who wont date and hoping they get cancerthis so makes me want to go to his failing cafe    anyone else had experience with this fucktard
  the market in chinatown has been gone for ages so i dont know where else theyre selling bootlegs
  but hes gay
  yes he is but tries to hide it by harassing girls i should know i used to be part of his cafe where he tried it on with me luckily my friends where there to look after to me as he proceeded to try and get me drunk
why is weird nose beth such a cunt
  doesnt surprise me he is a gay cunt on the same level as lewis if you ask me
  literally who
  is this about amazoniancos again you guys need to obsess over something other than hating some random girl just go outside once in a while
  speaking as a gay cunt we dont associate with lewis or duggan they were long since blacklisted from our organisation
  i dont think so i cant remember her full name but she always looks a mix of sucking a lemon and smelling a ripe fart which might be the case cause her attitude sucks dick
  whats her cosplay name then doesnt sound like the beth anon mentioned
  from that description id guess they mean beth brookes minachi cosplay lol im not overly familiar but the name crops up a fair amount in dramu talk
  oh yeah her shes a cow
  i get how cons work just not how hyper japan shat the bed so quickly between a great summer event and a dismal winter one i want to hold out hope next julys con will be a return to what i assume is form and not more of this crap
  the gay is a lie
credit where its due for beth she blew the whistle on a commissioner who was ripping off a lot of people   she can be difficult to get on with but a lot of other people just let them get away with it for over a year and crept out of the woodwork when they thought theyd be able to get their money back with someone else fighting their corner
  give her credit for that but then she did the same to other people / shes also been known to lie about having made costumes she bought/commissioned and entered them into contests
  whats up with her apart from being fat
    thats shitty and all but its ancient in terms of news and beating a dead horse she took herself off the market as a commissioner two years ago at least and i dont believe shes competed with anything bought in that time either let alone won anything with the rushed messes she does manage to make   the last noteworthy thing she did was fall off a stage midperformance and i found that hysterical    im all for having a good ass kick of someone who really deserves it but she hasnt done anything worth talking about recently its like bringing up that emoemu girl who pretended to have cancer years ago its not adding anything to the conversation though i suppose i cant really blame anyone for having to dig up old things because the british comm is well and truly dead at the moment    so whats everyones next con what projects are people working on is anyone pulling together any christmas themed cosplays for shoots

  no kuma is ever to big i like my big kumakumya cuz it fits way more inside then all the other ones and it looks cute as a rucksack unless youre like 3ft tall it looks cute on everyone
  thank you may i ask how much it can fit inside i know the smaller ones are notorious for fitting very little
  i can fit my android phone ear buds cardholder keys and pepper spray but honestly i could probably fit more if i tried an actual wallet could fit if i had one not those rectangular ones tho unless u wanted to really shove it in there

  can be classic or goth u baka neko
  gothic more than classic

  if u had dignity u wouldnt be on 4chan kek
    i have this in black i might take a picture next time i wear it as i looked all over and really the only thing i saw was the shop photo     cryptkasper has the skirt i know it isnt the dress but maybe gives you and idea of styling
    confirmation that bitches who come here to whine about fatties are fucking skeletons
aatps beauty and the rose promise jsk in blue anyone  all i can find are the other colours just bought this spontaneously after i already owned the cream version at some time and now im at a loss how to coordinate it the best way
        with reactions like these no wonder no one wants to post themselves or post in worn threads
meanwhile ctp reservation is over lets share some inspo in any colorway bonus points for coords other than white blousewhite socks
  i hope if you have an ed you get help anon i believe in you and love u stay strong
  nobody wouldve said a word about it if the girl had on otks and long sleeves
  wearing her own print tho 3
  is that imai kira she looks cute
  it really is hard to find creative ctp coordinates maybe well see some next year or whenever the new ones arrive
  i dont anons just assume      this looks like itd be really pretty styled in a moitié way
im getting ribbon berry bunny in yellow so looking for some inspo in this colorway if at all possible
  anon i love that print im also tempted to get the yellow but i already have it in blue heres the only pic i could find in yellow it might be the op though
  here is the laziest photo of all time maybe it helps
  so uh self post but the story is someone lent me ctp to wear to a sneakers meet
got this recently and just wondering what others have done with it
   thank you so much the size looks much more managable irl than i thought it did its so cute thanks again
    ronald mcdonald kei
cant find any worn pics of angelic prettys sweet bunny chan if somebody has anything itd be great  thanks
  oops i meant sweet bearchan time for bed i think sorry
  glad to help i meant to take a photo days ago but only just got around for the record my pixel 2 with a case and a popsocket fit in my usa but anything taller than that wouldnt go
any good worn pictures of these i found three coords with them on cof and a couple on instagram but the boots werent clear/prominent in the pictures
  example of the sort of quality i was finding pic related
if anyone has pics of this pls post any colorway is fine
  shes huge so much floof fuck this is amazing thank you for sharing anon
im looking for some inspo in this colorway it is bodyline t___t
anyone have worn pics of this that arent stock images or already up on taobao im wondering how the fabric looks irl
  the navy looks so out of place and those tights dont match either
  its black and white anon how do not not understand how to coord such a simple piece
any thoughts on how to coord this bonnet or what to use it with i kind of thought either magical etoile in red holy night story in white or possibly metas red firework print forget the name
  i honestly the only print that could work with this is holy night story but red instead of white the white would look super unbalanced imo
  aps lovely bunny jsk in red
  that could work but ive had such a hard time finding it  everyone only sells it in black
admittingly its a dress that everyone and their mom owns but somehow ive yet to find a decent coord that uses the normal waist version most coord pics i could find included either the highwaist version or the op so any decent coord pic with the normal waist jsk is appreciated
any worn pictures of lady sloth dresses without the waist hidden by a belt/sash  in her stock photos the waistline is always covered with a belt or waist ties or something makes me worry about whether or not the skirt part is gathered and pressed properly i had an indie brand dress with a lumpy waist before and i dont want to be ripped off again
requesting worn pics of aps prism princess
  lolll i used to own this so i looked back through my photos and for some reason the only coord pic i have is this one i sold it bc it was too sweet for me but its a solid piece
looking for pics of these in any color especially side view
  i really like how you used the socks this is something id totally wear out and about
  ewww bangless ita and anachan too
  and people wonder why no one selfposts here any more
  theres one in the cof thread right now with a blue blouse and socks anon its pretty cute
  just look up pink clown shoes on google images
  nayrt but i was thinking man no wonder nobody selfposts on cgl if most of them look like this
  this is the worn thread not cof take your gripes elsewhere  the picture is of someone wearing the dress posted end of story      the ones that dont selfpost are the landwhale lolitas at heart
  this its obvious the coordinate you fatties are bitching about is just trying on its not serious
  we used to have a board culture here we even had waywt threads that died with the new rules now anons are even worse
  thank you for answering anon  i noticed that some of the earlier releases of this dress those without the bows at the front and back and that arent slightly pulled up but still normal waisted like yours seem like theyre shorter than the later rereleased ones that do have the mentioned features see initial post do you know if this is true asking this because im scared to have another fail buy because i underestimate the numbers and the structure of the dress need the long length to not look like a shapeless rectangle    pic related is what i assume is the navy colored version of your dress and possibly an early version
  mine was from the first release so yes im not sure how the new ones sit maybe you could wear an underskirt with it since its not a busy pattern
reve du paradis jsk
sorry if this is the wrong thread but does anyone have pictures of people wearing original lotta jsk vs revival people dont generally put which version they have in captions and they look different from each other in the stock pictures
i didnt think i was going to end up getting another dress before this year ended but my mom pulled through for my birthday with giving me money for this jsk    only problem is that despite my overwhelming love for it i have no idea what sort of blouse i should even be looking at to pair with it i feel like i need more faux fur items to go with it but maybe im being tacky lmao does anyone have experience with this jumperskirt
  anon they said it was an old photo and that it didnt fit their style lol chill the fuck out saltchan
anyone know the source on this print i thought it was celestial at first am i just an idiot
  i think its royal princess alice
  thanks i found it
  found another
  i had a jumper skirt like this turtleneck looks nice with it in my opinion fau fur items will look good too maybe a long sleeve cutsew congrats on the grab super cute
  idk if youre still around anon but i have this op in black sans apron i just want to check before posting in case youre only looking for the pink version
  the original is cotton and much darker and the revival is lighter and polyesther  
i believe this is an official picture by meta but has anyone seen this dress around lately
  what shoes are those
  theyre from antaina or angelic imprint i cant remember which
  well people will react if youre a whale or a skeleton
  they shouldnt were here to talk about fashion not bodies
requesting worn pics of the vanillachan jsk any colorway
  this but not in a bad way  she would be aesthetic af if the only thing she did different was hide the ed
  underweight / ed    underweight even severely affects the body  an ed is also in your mind and do tell me please can you read her mind    or do you and all the other anons think the jews had all anorexia nervosa back in wwii    you shitty people get off cgl she was only trying to help

  someone asked for inspo not shit that belongs in the ita thread

  nayrt but no one asked for salt
any coord pics of deborah doll from mary magdalene thanks
  searching wa in cof yields mostly results of these meta jsks you should take a look over there
  i find this hard to coordinate if you dont have a lot of the flowy btssb stuff  heres a floordinate i made socks should be white tho

i swung by midwest fur fest yesterday out of morbid curiosity and to kill some time and the things i had seen cannot be unseen i was only there for a couple hours but the emotional scars will last forever any other anons ever been to a degenerate con like that just for shits and giggles how did it go
  i went just cause i was curious haha i wonder what crazy things will happen haha lol
  makes a post about stories about furry conventions  was at a furry convention  doesnt post any story    guess it wasnt that much fun
so right off the bat the stench of the convention center was just vile the stench of sunday anime and comic cons aint got shit on the foul odors of the sunday furry con it was so bad that the smell was starting to give me a headache     everyone there was also fugly as hell im far from anyones standard of attractiveness myself but my god it was like no one else attending had ever heard of soap or a hair brush before the only decent looking people were a handful of the artists and dealers who were the ones there to make a living     and the autism was unlike anything i had ever seen there were grown ass men unironically making uguu kawaii sounds and hiding behind others and extremely questionable fashion choices galore so many people wearing shitty corsets that didnt fit paired with dirty blue jeans and tank tops     also the amount of 18 content was as ubiquitous as it was unsurprising there was a whole gallery of framed furry fetish work with bidding on each piece i got the chance to see someone sperg out firsthand when he saw his bid on a furry threesome piece had won     after that entire experience suddenly anime convention crowds dont seem quite as insufferable to me anymore
  i thought i knew what i was signing up for but then again i am a certified dumbass
  sorry senpai im a slowass typer i posted 
  my bad it was an interesting read
desu i respect furries as much as i dislike them    they have some real nice craftsmen in their ranks like some of the work they put is legitimately nice and they could go far if they poured their efforts into well something else
i vaguely remember an ad for this somewhere was this around the kc area
ive been to two furry cons both were fantastic the first had a huge amount of free cookies pic related and the 2nd gave all the vendors free lunch and dinner everyone was super nice too
  my friend vended at a furry con once and she said it was one of the best experiences shes had selling at a con everyone was polite welcoming respectful etc i dont think that con is active in my city anymore but when it was all profits were donated to a wildlife rescue    because theres so many shitty people in the furry fandom the rest can go overboard trying to erase the bad image so i feel like a furry can either go really well or really terribly depending on which way the scales tip

  the rules are the same for men as for women    you do not need to wear a wig but your hair must look good with your coord most men keep their hair too short or unstyled and it looks bad    makeup is not necessary but a clean face is maintain good hygeine and grooming you will look better with at least minimal makeup though a bit of bb cream can help smooth out imperfections and provide some moisture     oujis armoire on tumblr and buttcapes ouji guide on blogspot have good rundowns of rules for ouji so read and reread em    elliott aka technotropism pictured may be everyones favorite ouji man he uses his natural hair and moderate makeup

  not sure why you called this menherastyled makeup looks like typical asian makeup styles not menhera at all
buttcape has a brief overview of aatps design timeline     she tracks who the main designers were and points out that the latest looks on the runway lacked any black coords the writeup misses including sweeter sets from old/midschool times though      that is what the ouji in the photo labelled it menhera shiro ouji i used a screenshot so the original japanese caption would be demonstrated i am no menhera expert but the look does seem to me to be different from what oujis in japan usually wear for makeup perhaps it is meant to combine the styles
  keras writeup of the anniversary event is also up     to review the ouji looks you can visit them at     however the kera article has coords beyond what were in the fashion show they have disabled rightclicking to view and save the images so here are screenshots of the nonrunway ouji coords from the article    props to pic related dude for rocking natural hair without dullness
  it seems ouji is entering ott sweet mode buttcape attributes the design shift to chinese consumer influence but i think it is just an overdue evolution of ouji as it finally breaks from the standard of butlerkei to move closer to what is happening in lolita fashion
    who is the qt in the pic
  buttcape
is boy style actually for men or is it basically a crossplay genre of cgl
  your answers are in the first post newfriend
  i skimmed the thread to confirm that there have been discussions of men in ouji in this general already if you cannot read a gen this short 69 replies many of which are just images or search to see if your topic has been covered 4chan may not be the right place for you
  every single ouji is a woman crossplaying a male character    pic related the lolita is in an alternative fashion but the ouji is actually a crossplay of an npc from a mobile dating sim
  another lolita with a crossplayer this woman was so dedicated she picked a character whose outfit would match the lolitas clothes and for realism she applied each facial hair individually
  lolitas dont mind their partners showing up to fashion events in crossplay as long they match this is why oujis are called accessories women have to pick a male character who will complement a lolitas personal style
  of course its easier for asian boystylers to pass as men because asians are naturally more androgynous     pic related an infamous crossdresser who sticks to kaori yuki characters when she crossplays
  in fact the most popular boystyler is manna samma who is so good at crossplaying video game characters that she makes people question their sexualities
  this is what she looks like out of crossplay for reference
  those poor clothes are about to explode
i noticed that ouji has mostly long sleeves for every jacket and blouse is it possible to wear short sleeves and not make it look like a blouse meant for lolita please dump your pics if you have any good examples
  its weird to me because so many people consider the roland a dream item while it is perhaps the most toned down traditionally masculine piece in the fashion while more on the ott side people also consider things like captain hollow napoleon versailles and crimson jack to be aatps peak while they go on to release fewer and fewer things in that style maybe the asian market is eating it up in comparison    i find it difficult and imagine it impossible for the average person to look at most ott lolita and see something wearable while the material in     leaves a bit to be desired it at least looks like a functional outfit inspired by but distinct from vkei           these are nice examples of what people imagine when an ouji accessory is mentioned  and if they could be considered accessories it is undeniable that they fit in and match the aesthetic of lolita         these things for example strike me as distinctly ouji         while these bear very little resemblance these look a lot like a lolita coord with pants and i think there is a difference between lolita with pants and ouji as an exercise you can look through cof or wherever cover up the top half and then the bottom half of a coord rate each individually and then as a whole the top and bottom of most outfits rarely seem to play well with each other because people are mixing things like rolands with shorts and otks and while we consider both of those ouji the bisection looks like two completely different styles are being propped one on top of the other     meanwhile where do we draw the line between aristo and ouji  why does lolita have such ridiculous rigid structure and we have like 5 distinct neglected and poorly understood styles huddled under one name like an orphanage for bad fashion ideas
  anon this is a dude not a crossplayer
  i am in shock that you could not detect their sarcasm
    cant see someones being sarcastic
  shes just really good at crossplaying much more believable than  whose beard is obviously fake
  meanwhile where do we draw the line between aristo and ouji  why does lolita have such ridiculous rigid structure and we have like 5 distinct neglected and poorly understood styles huddled under one name like an orphanage for bad fashion ideas  because people spread misinformation over a decade ago and nobody corrected them loudly enough    aristocrat is only really used by moitie    ouji is what most people call boystyle lolita and boystyle is a phrase used by entities such as kera to describe the masculine counterpart to any particular fashion it got traction in the west in order to refer to ouji and aristocrat a few years ago    for many designers ouji is simply lolita with pants especially feminine ouji styles and also i think especially for taobao brands for japanese designers ouji is often an afterthought for lolita not much energy or creativity goes into the design    aatp is trying some very experimental silhouettes for ouji maybe because the fashion in general is nebulously defined and even they as the most popular ouji brand maybe do not have a clear vision for it     when i look at a kera spread like this which features many casualer ways to wear ouji it seems like there is a lot of untapped potential to the style that most designers ignore so fashion editors and oujis themselves have to compensate and figure out the possibilities and limits of the fashion on their own or else stick with the very practical but boring default of lolita but not as girly with pants and other plausibly masculine clothing items ie no headbows or bonnets
  furthering the status of ouji as a bastard child of harajuku fashion a genderless halfsibling if lolita a lot of japanese people who wear ouji just call it lolita here is my lolita coord today they say and it is a standard ouji look    even this kera spread throws some stuff together and calls it a lolita school boy look not ouji but i have seen coords that look like this tagged by the japanese person wearing it as ouji and offbrand ouji coords on sites like wearjp tend to follow the basic structure of pants or shorts a button down and another layer on the torso a vest jacket or cardigan     please forgive my disorganized thoughts i am on my way out the door i share your frustration about ouji as a fashion orphan and it has driven me to obsession
  genderless halfsibling if lolita  of not if
  there used to be a big fuss over people combining the ouji and aristo threads as though they were different enough so as to require separation but the aristo threads were even more dead than the ouji threads and have now been assimilated into the boystyle thread im still not sure if aristo is an ouji substyle or if ouji and aristo are very distinct boystyle styes       early lolita in general is full of creativity and experimentation i think i recall someone on lj proclaiming themselves an authority on lolita and pulling a list of rules out of their ass and for some reason it caught on im sure original lolitas would look at those rules we now follow and spit on them     casual lolita and ouji is really interesting because half the community will swear that any casual lolita coord is not lolita at all probably citing one of those rules a westerner made up on lj a decade after lolita became a thing the death of punk is pretty unfortunate since it most often broke the established rules with creative offbrand and unconventional silhouettes it doesnt feel like there is much driving the fashion forward except for the taobao brands that are mostly producing shonen protagonist and sherlock holmes outfits which while cool in their own right are pretty difficult to build a daily wardrobe out of
    i am very tired and not thinking properly but i had a recent discussion that is sort of relevant to how the japanese do not necessarily distinguish lolita from ouji i love and hate ouji with equal intensity and this annoyance has plagued me for several ages and i have grown old with the deep existential sorrow in my heart of not knowing exactly what to tag my photos as besides notkodona     when a lolita brand makes tshirts sweaters and pajamas it is sort of accepted that these are novelties not to be worn with lolita but to show your support of the brand or something in normie wear this seems silly to me when the brand is clearly making more clothes to be worn with their other clothes meta makes a pair of pink shorts you wear them with a blouse socks and shoes all from meta meta is a lolita brand and everything you are wearing constitutes a lolita coordinate except for the pants this does not suddenly make it a different genre altogether it is lolita if you posted it to cof however the community would be at odds arguing over why it was not lolita that it was ouji or that it was neither     this is sort of why i feel like ouji should stay on the masculine end of the spectrum because its mostly just lolita with pants and i think lolita with pants should just be lolita by heading back into the cutesy prince end of the spectrum the more similar it is to frilly lolita the less of an individual identity it has it becomes less its own thing that might be exactly where it needs to go and should have been all this time to begin with and maybe the masculine/mature look can live on as aristocrat or something the dozen active ouji in the world should make a vote personally the less interchangeable lolita and ouji clothing is to me the better
  while i sympathize with you and generally prefer the more masculine side of ouji myself i dont really understand or agree with your desire to create such a dramatic distinction between ouji and lolita from the very beginning ouji was always the boystyle version of lolita theyre like sibling fashions so i think its reasonable that there would be some overlap or gray area between the two if we were to eliminate all of the lolita elements and pieces from the definition of what is considered ouji i think wed be left with a very limited and rigid style with a tiny number of brands rarely producing pieces which would be nearly indistinguishable from western historical fashion maybe thats not exactly what youre suggesting in which case i apologize for misrepresenting your argument but to me the variety of styles and mix of masculine and feminine elements in ouji is a positive thing it gives us flexibility and more pieces to work with and its not like you have to wear the more feminine or sweet elements if you dont want to    despite the stricter rules laid out for lolita mostly in the west theres still a good amount of variety within the style for example a cute ott sweet coord will look quite different from a mature gothic coord which could even feature the traditionally masculine roland mentioned in  i think what youre proposing would be similar to lolitas saying that only the most ott sweet coordinates should truly be considered lolita because all other styles are not frilly and feminine enough it really cuts down on what you can do within the style
  why cant people just wear what they like the way the like it if someone likes cute ouji good if someone wears mature ouji still good who cares you dont necessarily need to find a term that 100 perfectly describes your style and a style doesnt need to be 100 definite and precise i think it isnt even possible im not disagreeing with you im just sorry that its so complicated for you and that you are kind of feeling bad over something that i personally find quite simple
 you  that being said i do understand the frustration that comes comes with your preferred style falling out of favor and not getting many new releases i like the more masculine stuff too but unfortunately narrowing the definition of ouji to be just that and nothing else wont change that all we can really do for now is scour second hand sales for pieces we like share photos of our coords/support others with similar sensibilities and hope our style catches on and of course throw money at brands on the occasion they do release stuff we like trends come and go and if were lucky itll come back around eventually        not sure if aristo is an ouji substyle   the masculine/mature look can live on as aristocrat    in japan aristocrat is definitely not a substyle of ouji i kind of think of it as a cousin to the sibling relationship that ouji and lolita have there are similarities/overlap but not quite much the styling is a lot more gothic it generally has a pretty flowy look makeup is dark around the eyes to contrast with the rest of the face and visual kei hair is pretty common i feel like im not doing the best job of describing it but if you just look at a picture of mana and compare it to any ouji the differences should become apparent since they are so distinct in styling under this definition it would be a little odd to transfer more mature variations of ouji to be under this label    in the west aristocrat is what you call your ouji coord when youre worried about being perceived as cute or girly so i guess if we stick with this definition it could work    people are mixing things like rolands with shorts and otks  just out of curiosity do you think rolands should never be worn with short pants and otks or did you just mean shorts of a certain length
oh dear i made a bad sleep deprivation rant again    i was trying to be silly with how extreme i described my anguish and confusion i think that all the labels and categorization are an obnoxious nightmare and that its all just lolita my frustration is when anything too casual or too mature is called out as notlolita because the over complicated system of categorization exists and is accepted maybe it is only a loud minority having notlolita arguments though i mean shit as far as im concerned otome is just casual lolita google otome and tell me that 9/10 of the top results arent just lolita without a petti and then tell me where lolitas in 1999 decreed that the fashion required a petticoat    ive found that we treat pirate and military and vampire ouji for example as their own substyles when they are just themes we have sweet gothic and classic ouji the same way lolita does pirate and vampire ouji are as much a substyle as pirate and vampire lolita  they generally fall under gothic maybe classic but hell you could do a creative sweet vampire if you wanted to       the only real issue that i have with the sweet and mature ouji coords being under the same label is that i end up in an ocean of cutesy boys clothing when i search for items or coords in tags if it were common use to tag gothic_ouji or aristouji or something would slightly improve quality of life maybe itll catch on like kodona if we just force the meme
  oh look its ciel
  i think what youre proposing would be similar to lolitas saying that only the most ott sweet coordinates should truly be considered lolita    i think it is all lolita ouji is just lolita with pants if you look at goth fashion they dont have a different word for what the men wear and what the women wear for example that would be silly i think i am in an argument with myself over whether or not the ouji term justifies its own existence should be abolished or try to branch off from lolita      do you think rolands should never be worn with short pants and otks or did you just mean shorts of a certain length  i have worn them together and i have seen them worn well but the silhouette can be hard to balance i think that the length and boxy fit of almost all brandbottoms are the issue they arent something you can easily tailor to your body and most people wouldnt dare anyways     pic related is in my nonspo folder for proportions maybe on a slim female frame one of two of these might work i find similar issues with many ouji coords that use unflattering combinations of long jackets and short pants/shorts causing the legs especially to look extremely short if you look at any guide to shortmens fashion and most ouji are short women wearing mens fashion so similar enough ouji ticks off a lot of the do not boxes these guys extend their torsos with untucked shorts making them look like they have dwarf legs along with giant disproportionate clown shoes compared to whats going on up top
    before  goes off on me posting ciel was a joke
  marilyn monroe with a bandana and gun shirt  i hate these things so much that and the overly tattooed snow white shirts
  pirate and vampire ouji are as much a substyle as pirate and vampire lolita  they generally fall under gothic maybe classic but hell you could do a creative sweet vampire if you wanted to   the only real issue that i have with the sweet and mature ouji coords being under the same label is that i end up in an ocean of cutesy boys clothing when i search for items or coords in tags  agreed use classicouji or gothicouji if you like i would advise against aristouji because that would shift the jargon even further from its japanese roots and increase rather than decrease label confusion    lolita is still lolita whether it be fanny rosie or lovely lor ouji is still ouji even when it is mature though perhaps mature ouji would not be a bad tag
  i have a few i hope they are ok for your needs
  this is a bit more difficult than i thought to find pics represent diverse styles but also shortsleeved
  not sure if elbowlength is good
  sweet and especially sailor seem to be the way to go
  but darker styles seem to work if you can find a nonpuffy sleeve maybe
  and military shirts/jackets also seem available in short sleeve styles
  jackets seem less likely to be short sleeved but 3/4 seem available
i dont make my cosplays because i dont know how that said where is a good place to buy himikos outfit  with a affordable price  i need her out fit for next years convention for a bnha panel so any one who has bought her cosplay from somewhere could you recommend me a link please

does anyone else have problems where an ali seller will take their sweet time shipping stuff out even to the point of missing the ship date like what do they just hate money its only happened to me like twice but its really frustrating and i know that sellers are probably backed up from 11/11 but this feels a little ridiculous
i juat got a message from an ali store to cancel my order bc they apparently cant ship to canada due to the strike our post is still working ffs its just slower in some parts everything else shipped why cant they
  probably to save their ass in case they get a scammer that tries to flag their package as missing due to the strike
half the shit i want has a higher black friday price than the current sale price
  anon canada post sent out notices to all other countries to please stop sending mail until further notice because theyve got truckloads of unsorted mail thanks to the strike so other countries are just not shipping anything out to allow them to catch up its all bullshit but thats why
  thats kind of what i thought too    aw shit really fuck i just want my stuff to arrive why is this country hellbent on making everything as complicated and asenine as possible
  can you post some more of these fake black friday sale items you found there this is why i never buy on black friday
    they did but apparently ive heard if you use certain lines like ems or other carriers like maybe yanwen or fedex or ups whatever that some of those carriers are still able to get some mail through cant verify its just what ive heard around my comm  yeah i just want my shit to arrive too theres stuff held up for a month already and now i dont even know when ill be able to expect it fuck my christmas gifts i guess canada post union is literally retarded theyre complaining about wages and having to do overtime when they already get paid well over whats fair for unskilled labor as a starting wage and make double for overtime they dont even realize theyre paid well already for what it is they do but hey lets fuck up every other canadians holidays by striking before christmas/black friday complete stupidity
  the postal union pisses me off this isnt even the first time theyve pulled this shit they already have higher wages and benefits what more do they fucking want when will they be satisfied  i hope you get your stuff anonfriend and i hope this mess is dealt with soon
a seller has been pushing me to pay an extra 30 on a cosplay to rush my order or saying i should cancel otherwise what the heck is going on here
  cancel it then see what happens next
  obviously you can still use private courier services
  never cancel  it happened to me multiple times  extend a day every day until you dont want it anymore
im about to have a 200 craft haul purchase on aliexpress itll be my first big haul from them since im here what has been the most expensive haul you guys have ever done on ali and what were the items
  i saw this for a top i wanted to buy too the black friday price was about 4 more expensive than the actual price woke up this morning to buy it and they had already raised the price by about 6 so it looked like the black friday price was actually cheaper
  i only had one seller do that so far for this 11/11 i extended the date by a day so im still waiting on it to ship out i get that its a large order but theyre still getting like 100 for it  i just want my pants so i can stop freezing in skirts already
besides hsiu wigs what are sone good places to get wigs from l mail
  the most i spend is 3050 usually on stickers washi and stationery paper
  most ive spent on a single seller was 90 for a lolita dress that ended up not fitting my rib cage even after letting it out so i made it into a skirt and some bows    11/11 this year i spent around 130 all together
  not sure which one you meant but heres both              
what are you guys getting from the black friday sale
these shoes still havent shipped from 1111 and im going crazy
  link 3
  and a ring light for my phone
  anyone buy weeb shirts on ali  im wondering what the size difference is for burgers and if the graphic quality is any good some tshirts and longs sleeves the image starts to flake off after one wash  but this synthwave style tachikoma is just too cute

    nta but similar question good place to get bangs

  link to the cellphone star charm
  i literally cant buy most brand shoes because my feet are too large unlike stomach girth i cant really change the size of my feet im basically an underweight big foot but thanks     the seller has already contacted me several times and said they are being made which makes sense because most ali sellers just rely directly on a factory im just awfully impatient because my monster feet are cold
heres a sampling of what i bought from 1111 and black friday this isnt everything but im happy i was able to keep my spending down around 50 on 1111 and 65 on black friday    part 1 of 2
  part 2 of 2

  ive always been hesitant about buying mori clothing on aliexpress because im not sure about the quality i hate bad fabrics and most cute stuff is resold from taobao marking up the price what do you think about this do you know a good store one can trust
sorry for the babby question gulls    but is there an image search for google like there is for aliexpress google isnt giving me shit

  sauce
  sure just share
  what happened anon
  canada post workers are going on strike and china is practically refusing to do business with canadians at this point for fear of lost packages
  my stuff from taobao is stuck in shipping warehouse since nov 16 worried about the same thing
        hopefully it will clear soon and i hope that we havent lost our packages
i came back to cgl afteryears of not visiting just for this question    any other canadian anons notice due to strike a listing will say free shippinng or like xxx for shipping but as soon as you tap on it the shipping jumps to like 98 i know there was the strike and shit but is it due to that
i need to stop buying aliexpress/chinese shit clothes    the fabric is either crap or half the piece isnt sewn together    also im a tall white chick so it never looks right    plus side i had 11/11 shipping that only took two weeks crazy fast anons
  im a short average build/more chubby than not white chick trust me this shit dont look right on anyone you generally have to accept you will have to sew/modify this shit to an extent
what are the best keywords for cute pastel stuff its been a while since i shopped on ali  im looking for some sweaters i used to be able to just look for harajuku and find a bunch of things i liked but that doesnt seem to work anymore the keyword is flooded with a lot of bland stuff
  harajuku basically follows the latest trends so it went from pastel to holographic/cyber stuff to now korean inspired normie looks    try kawaii and sort by category so youre not overwhelmed with stationery and socks
  have you tried putting in the companies that these are knock offs of
  thank you   that makes sense i didnt realize it was koreanish stuff      i dont follow fashion well enough to recognize knock offs or know their brands
  i think theyre onto western vanity sizing finally i bought normie dresses using the size charts for the items and got ls they were huuuuge i normally wear a s or m in western sizes shouldve just bought a normal size
  this i am an average short girl probably similar to an average chinese girl honestly and aliexpress shit never fits right regardless of size the good thing is its cheap and you can usually modify it to fit
  would you say that this store is a good reseller id prefer to have the aliexpress protection instead of going through something like mylolitadress for taobao brands
  well i did get it from alie    
  continuing from   so yeah it is a good reseller the dress came within 2 weeks despite the 11/11 rush ive also bought from them before and never had trouble
  ive bought from this seller before as well theyre really good
  i havent bought personally from this seller but ive got in touch with the staff and they seem legit they still sell design replicas unfortunately but as long as you buy taobao brands youll be fine its also way better than having to go through a shopping service given the shipping is free just compare prices to clobba online or something like that it really is a good deal imo for reference i live in europe and here customs are really high  shipping is usually pretty expensive
      thanks guys yeah i live in europe too so shipping and customs etc can get annoyingly high ali might be the way to go for my taobao needs
want to buy a geeky video game tshirt  all of them are for men not even the unisex cut        im tall 172cm 58 tho in eu its still not uncommon but im spending a lot of time at uni business center and i see that many of the freshmen girls are almost american level of round and everything fits unless its simply too short just dont buy kawaii stuff thats clearly for kids or not so obviously on this board because these usually have theconventionweeb looks
time for a new help thread old thread   what are you stuck on
  if you wanna make a large pony tail like thisyou should start with a foam base to get the general shape that you want and from there you can coat the foam with wig fibers to give the illusion that you have a whole ponytail under the first layer of hair
  my clear coat faded some paint underneath on a piece made of plastic has this happened to anyone else how can i prevent this from happening    the two paints the main color and the clear coat were both of the same brand and it faded both glossy and matte finishes
i bought a cheap wig and the top of the wig is kind of pointy how can i fix it so its not as pointy
  heat it up and press it down  with a blow drier steamer etc
  how would it attach do you think i wonder if i glue the foam base around the short base wig ponytail and then coated it in the fibers from there butif anything were to happen with it detaching itd be a mess to reposition the base wig fibers without taking the whole ponytail off and reflying eventually i imagine that would become ugly  i dont think a regular alligator clip would be strong enough
  ah i just saw the last threads reply i did a regular ponytail wig once before and the sewin clips worked even with my shirt hair but the wig was still hell to wear all day maybe with this one being up high and not low it wont hurt as much     and actually i take back my last comment maybe i could make the ponytail with the foam base attach it and have a separate strip of fibercoated felt to wrap around where they attach that would cover the ugliness i just dont understand her hair lol
  look at cowbuttcrunchies tutorials regan is a master of wigs
what materials should i use to make tokoyamis head i want to avoid using feathers and furs since i want to keep it stylistic im considering using eva foam for the base    also how should i construct the head ive cosplayed object head characters in the past so i have a good idea on how to make the head but it feels like i should treat it as if im making a fursuit and i have no experience with that if it helps i want the beak to be movable
  you can find an eva foam head pattern for tokoyami on etsy it was quite useful you can use some rivets to make a movable jaw
can someone please help me figure out how to do this monstrosity of a wig
  what can i use for make up pic related never done anything similar my skin color is like coffee milk but a bit lighter i think
  lacefront tie the back up and sew on extra wefts to hide the seams the bun maybe do foam core
the chest piece/glove here have some padding that im not sure how to approach my instinct is eva foam but will it look too flat
  maybe carve the pieces out of the green foam thats at joanns idk what its called officially and then cover with stretch fabric looks like a life jacket i think they are foam with neoprene or something but you dont have to go that hard obviously
  that green foam is called floral foam and thats a terrible idea the first time someone bumps into him that foam will dent like a motherfucker
  no the flexible kind by all the batting and pillows and stuff not that styrofoam its green
is there any place that sells a good chrom or is it better that i just make one from scratch
  sounds like the coat under the clear coat hadnt fully set/cured yet if this is spray paint the outside humidity/temperature are big factors in how long it takes paint to cure above 70 and its just not going to happen even though the can may say 3045 minutes between changing colors you may want to wait overnight      since the belt over the chest doesnt push into it im thinking its more armor than padding id look at using some form of thermoplastic and covering with a stretch fabric
white diamond anon here from the last thread i just had a thought i was thinking of adding leds to the inside of her cape sandwiched between two layers of fabric and using clear pieces over some of the stars in order to give some brightness to her outfit    my questions are     what type of leds should i use   can i use clear vinyl for the stars or is there a more suitable material  
  oh i think youre thinking of upholstery foam that should be firm enough      i like your idea as well if its just armor it makes thinks easier    thanks for the input
  ben nye snazaroo or any other type of face paint use a very light gray to contour and bring life back into your face
    the homestuck community will have really good references on these but any colored facepaint tutorial will be helpful
  this wig certainly is a beast i think ardas chibi classic in salmon which is on sale for 20 rn would be a good place to start i know you dont need ponytails but the pulled back look  bangs is definitely going to help with your style heres how i would do it  bunt cut half of the bangs  brush back the other half of the bangs to blend in with the rest of the hair like you would to your own head when making a ponytail  undo the chibis ponytails and pull them to the back to create that low bun look secure with hairspray and flower clip there will be extra hair to chop that off making sure to blend the hair when doing this try to make that seam on the back of chibis head look natural and less tightly pulled ponytail  using the leftover hair from the ponytails or additional wefts wrap the hair around a foam core flat block  swirl the end pieces around the visible parts of the foam block to disguise it ensuring to keep a natural look  insert the hair chopsticks and additional accessories  i hope that helped good fucking luck dude that looks really hard
  its floral foam and it 100 dents with the slightest touch
  sounds like youd have to see it for yourself to determine that friendo
  please stop being retarded ive used it before to make totokos idol fish head from osomatsusan its not floral foam
  its just upholstery foam      anon did you try to use floral foam in place of upholstery foam please show us the results if you did this i have to see
  upholstery foam/mattress foam but yeah you should use eva foam for this      i would use basic fairy lights and then use two layers of black sheer curtain fabric
i am slowly starting to work on my first cosplay i am already average at makeup and know where to find good wigs and color contacts    but i want to start with a bought cosplay instead of making it so i can get the feel of it before i invest creating one because i have almost 0 experience with it    so any tips for a noob like me
  i love how you can write 3 lines without even remotely indicating what youre looking for
  idk if you want to buy a costume go ahead what do you want us to tell you just look at reviews and double check the sizing
  so any tips for a noob like me  dont buy from milanoope
    if you want the beak to be moveable what you do is have the top part of the beak be stationary but have a separate smaller lower jaw piece that you fit into place on your chin such that when your mouth is closed the beak is closed and when you open your mouth to talk the beak downs the same     i didnt make pic related but this is one i saw at a con earlier this year maybe it will give you some ideas     it looks like what they did was use smoothed down hair for most of the bird head transitioning to feathers at the back for effect
    thank you anons ill keep that in mind i like the ideas for the beak and would paperclay be a good choice for the beak or should i stick with foam    it looks like what they did was use smoothed down hair for most of the bird head transitioning to feathers at the back for effect  i was thinking about doing that but with stylized feathers like pic related not mine and i cant find a completed pic of it not sure if ill go with that yet because i dont want the head to look busy
  my special talent    let me explain more to make more sense of myself i am looking for some tips and tricks where to look at when buying cosplay and what stores are recommend and what stores should i avoid are there common mistakes new cosplayers fall into that i could avoud    hopefully this explains a little bit more haha
  is it racist/blackface if i get a tan to cosplay tanned anime girls like pic related  is tanning racist
  nah its fine as long as you can reach that color naturally also be careful not to get skin cancer
  i would use stylized spikes without the feather indentations or markings seems the best to maintain the anime look
    
hey guys  so im currently helping my boyfriend building a gang orca cosplay especially he want me to build a jaw that can be opened just like in the picture with some red leds on the eyes  i can totally do the leds but i have no clue how should i do this moving jaw i was wondering if servomotors would be enough to make it move or if i could use straps to attach on my bfs head in order to open the jaw when he opens his    do you have any ideas or tips to give me to do this  thanks 
has anyone built a yugioh duel disk before im building one for a friend but not quite sure how to go about it i was planning to do something with cardboard for the weight but im not sure if itll be sturdy enough anyone else have suggestions or experience
  legit would just get a pepakura file and make it out of the pvc sheets they sell at hobby stores idk how thick they sell them at though maybe beveled and sanded eva foam is better anything but cardboard
      pvc sheet would work i would look into pvc sheet  eva foam for the details on top seems like the best combination imo    just please do not use cardboard straight foam will not be stable enough for the wing part so you need some sort of stabilizing material under it like a pvc sheet
      youre above me with good wigs and color contacts and i make my own stuff lole    what youre asking for is very generic to the point of being useless different stores have different quality of cosplay as in a single store can have a good x character but a shit y character you need to look for specific designs/models    if you actually want to get into making cosplay i highly highly highly recommend you start with modifying existing clothing to suit your need go to goodwill or any thrift store with an open mind ie i went looking for either a large cheap leather jacket for ryuji from p5 or a pin striped suit for shuicihi from drv3 found no jackets but found a suit so i did saihara a huge amount of characters can be done by just modifying existing clothing adding new things etc look at tons of concept art to see what you are going to need     also bought cosplays will not help you teach how to make cosplays i guarantee you that the way they make them is completely different and they use equipment that a beginner does not need/have/can afford additionally the fabric is generally shit like the shit you see on party city costumes because lo and behold its not high quality unless you want to shell out big bucks they rarely fit well just no
  they rarely fit well  i have plenty of casual cosplaying friends who buy online and it just works because theyre flatt or plain below average with little curves if youre busty or big or have an ass theres when you have problems
  in this case youll probably want to get a larger size to fit your bust/ass and take in the parts that are too big if youre not confident doing it yourself find a seamstress in your area that does alterations
last time   since the last one had a few bits of dota sprinkled through it we may as well group all of the arts games together to hopefully keep things maybe slightly more active    assfaggots  aeon of strife styled fortress assault game going on two sides so you dont have to hit urban dictionary
dump to get things started
anyone seen a good makeup new evelynn cosplay yet i really want to take on that wig with leds and smoke effects but i absolutely despise body paint so i dont want to do the full cosplay desu and before anyone suggests a modified bodysuit has never looked good on anyone so no
  jesus the paint job on that bow
  bodysuits  looking good on anyone  at all
  what character is this
  its windranger from dota 2
  oh that explains why i couldnt find it thought it was a new lol char  thanks anon i love the costume
heres a few more
bump
a crystal maiden from the epicenter event a year or two back
i really dont want this thread to die  i really want to attempt to cosplay cyberpunk zoe but im clueless as to how i would make the wig work without it being five bajillion pounds does anyone have any suggestions i was thinking maybe incorporating some type of ribbon for the green things but i feel like that would look so bad
  i really dont want this thread to die too  i was gonna let it die but now that theres another anon with a common interest between the both of us itd be silly to let it  as for that zoe wigtake sona wig suggestions and hope they work on something longer than sonas hair length should be haram to go longer than that desu yet riot did
tis the season anons
anyone into smite im currently working on a cosplay from it
  if its cyberpunk the colored strands look like theyre supposed to be cables
might be a bit weak but here is my teemo cosplay    constructive criticism welcome
  great stuff 8 out of 8
saw this on my feed a bit back group cosplay of the newest star guardians
  sauce is fb/gorvennacos/ theres a couple extra behind the scenes ones too
    these look really good but wtf is that soraka horn lmao
  oh god that angle doesnt help battle bunny riven one bit
  needs better paint and the bell looks like its gonna fall apart any second
adding with this velkoz i met that looked sick
  ttthat soraka skirt what the everliving hell why would you shoop it like that
  its not shooped actually
  ive been interested in doing cosplay for a while now sorry for being a newfag and i thought id tried ot cosplay as mordekaiser but im honestly not sure where to begin any advice
  took me a while to figure out what this was then i realized it was the chinese new year morgana
  i hate out of proportion weapons the weapon isnt the full size a person its the size compared to the champ why do people not get that     anyway have i havent seen any eves yet any good or bad out there she would be sexy cool to do if someone could figure out how to do her tail coming out her skin/body and not just weird addons like a belt
    jinx doesnt have a nurse skin and she doesnt have blood splatters on her other outfits
  cosplayers do concepts like that all the time look at all the popstar versions of champions pool party versions of champions ahri gets cosplayed a lot in a pool party skin and doesnt actually have one
  theres a lot of eve cosplays
  tails and similar things like those eves tentacles or w/e they are lashes nearly always look so poor in the cosplays its kind of sad
  they are hard to make i give points to people for attempting them     have a yasuo that isnt half bad for once hes another champ that seems to be hard to pull off
  hes another champ that seems to be hard to pull off  probably because the people that actually like yasuo are bronze shitters
  is that kinpatsu she looks so much worse than her photos lmao
    girl tilt your head down you look like he who must not be named
    thats a sweet af gender swap
      now kiss and make default varus lol
  whats with his eyes why are they white its scary
  oh god youre right looks like a unicorn
  yeah what  said it was one of the ones featured during 2016 worlds damn good    probably i know that the last time we had a league thread her sg ahri was posted and people thought it was reasonably okay    also on the matter of things discussed a thread or two ago weapon proportions was also one of them mostly around star guardian lux but i guess this is becoming a bit of a theme with all of the guardians
  that shit aint cyberpunk  more like cyberpop or cyberpastel   go ruin other punks but not cyberpunk please
    its not cyber punk though its hacker do you even league
  hacker  lmao
      the skin name is cyber pop zoe tired of retards coming to shit up threads they know nothing about
  this onecant quite put my word on it somewhere between good and bad
        itt anons engage in a back and forth over something that a simple google search settles
dont mind me just a little lux dump from a showcase rito did a while back
  i love how this one turned out desu
  like how this one made her staff and back piece light up
  lil bit of shoop on this one for the effects though it makes sense some of the others are a little crazier and one is filtered to hell
  this i think is a bit out there with photoshop you be the judge on this one anons
  end of the dump
bump
  good for the most part the rocks seem like theyd be a pain to get right  bonus points for the funky nose that people love to make fun of
  tumblr nose
  yeah that
what do you guys think about original concepts
  sounds like a cool idea but most are terrible and lazy
  riot games will not invite you to the local tournaments cuz they dont like original concept cosplays except cute and sexy yordle humanisations so fuck no
  if the concept makes sense for the character and as long as it doesnt look like shit go for it  like this one this one makes reasonable sense even if riot wouldnt ever give sona a pool party skin for whatever the hell reasons they have
  riot didnt give pool party skins last year but you never know if this year will have one what i find amusing is the popstar cosplays for champs that are not ahri its not a skin line yet but is crazy popular to cosplay from
  youre right they passed on the series last year i think theyll probably put something out this year but another ultimate skin becomes due around that time itll have been about 18 months since lux got hers by then so well see
  im starting to think they passed on blood moon this year becuase we knew who got skins by led febuary every year before they should be announcing the ultimate soon but thats not a skin line that comes out with seasons like harrowing valentines lunar revel/bloodmoon pool party academy and snowdown
  yeah but it would probably be a good excuse for riot to pass on the pool party line for another year if it was closer to summer
  its march anon people dont even start preparing for spring and summer pool party stuff for at least another two months
  source
posting my still unfinished kayn cosplay
        source is facebook/haganecosplay
now for something completely different from league
  source is  shes also got league stuff too
  like pic related of star guardian miss fortune
  thats cause she shops them to hell and back honestly her photos always look eerily unnatural to me like her face looks exactly the same across all her characters
  tbh its not even her face idgaf about people shooping themselves to look better face wise but her costume looks so much shittier which is pretty sad since shes supposedly known for her crafting and not being a pretty face
i can understand why some might think its way too much shoop but i think it helps with the whole templar assassin using her abilities thing i dunno maybe its just a little too photoreal thats probably what the lens flares does to it now that i think about it two sides to each coin
  who has better craftsmanship boxbox or sneaky
  sneaky just buys cosplays im pretty sure boxbox had a friend make his arcade riven cosplay and i think he also helped out with making stuff so i think boxbox wins i love the both of them but boxbox is less of a memer and cuter
  sneaky happens to have a gf that also does cosplay so maybe she had a hand in making it i know she said she did his makeup
does anyone have sauce on where he bought this costume from i didnt see him answer but i was hoping someone would recognize the details
  its probably his gfs and she made it
  are you stupid esther cant sew jack shit shes a titty streamer for gods sake lmfao its from ascos
  wow you need to take a break from the internet
  says something stupid  gets btfod   iit was le joke xddd   guess you were only pretending to be retarded
  it looks like the one from miccostumes
  miccostumes  no its not its from ascos the miccostumes one is way lower quality/inaccurate colors and doesnt have lace on the gloves
so any wannabe first irelias already
  i give it 48 hours before they start appearing
  shes been out on pbe for a bit anyway so theyve had time to shit out an outfit
    shes a rework champ they dont get rush cosplayed as much as new champions probably because when you search old champion cosplay you find the old cosplays new champions in a cosply search is easier to get noticed because of the non existence of other cosplays more traffic to your image and easier milking of likes     but considering the newest champ im shocked there wasnt as many flood of cosplays of kaisa as there was of xayah when she came out
  this is giving me really conflicting feelings
  set that staff on fire and try again
  most of the rest of it is fine but for accuracy i wouldve gone with a different set of heels i know he was doing it partly for shits and giggles and probably asked his gf for whatever 5 inch pair she had something with 25 to 35 inches would be a lot more realistic but again sneaky did it for the memes theres another view where the heels are shown much better that i dont have saved here ill get it up later
  pic related
pax east is on someone already did pizza delivery sivir
        waist up he looks pretty good but his legs look exactly like someone that spends 90 of their time on their computer disappointing
      this looks shooped to hell but it makes sense because his gf also shoops the shit out of herself
  explain expand
  what is there to explain sneakys gf shoops the shit out of herself and looks like trash irl and shes also the one whos dressing him up and taking photos of him and likely shooping the shit out of him as well
  what more is there to explain his gf cosplays his gf shoops herself to oblivion he is shopped to oblivion theres nothing to expand on other then hes shopped because his cosplaying gf shoops
  what is happening to the crotch and i missing something here
  thats a penis buddy
tfw no jungle or top cosplayer gf    why must lux katarina jinx sona soraka and ashe exist
  why dont they make cute junglers or top laners
  because jungle and top lane is for fit women
  jungle and top lane is for fit women  fit  ah yes the main demographic of league is definitely fit
  lux  because perfection  katarina  because being fit is cool  jinx  to appeal to the crazies  sona  because tits and being mute  soraka  because healsluts  ashe  because riot felt the need to have a clone of drow ranger
  vayne  because riot has a boner for blizzard and wanted to cash in on the diablo iii demon hunter   kaisa   because riots boner is raging for blizzard and who doesnt love kerrigan
  hey quinn is pretty cute and she is a toplaner
  especially heartseeker probably because zeronis is the king of legs
  who even is his gf tho
  poppy is cute
    is this winter wyvern humanisation or bad executed ice drake shyvana
  wyvern humanization it sucks ass
guess who
  doesnt mention ahri   the premier korean lol waifu    also a lot of top laners arent kawaii girls because theyre mostly tanks and bruisers meaning mostly buff men and monsters jgl is a lot of animal people with some nice girls mixed in but a lot of them ramp up the sexy vibe to 11 eve elise nid although there are some exceptions like vi and diana hell if she does vi she can arrest all the shitty jinxes
  insert that one image of an ahri cosplayer playing dota in a cyber cafe here
  at least he started to rake in the patreonbux for the meme cosplays wise man
this is my pyke league of legends dagger the character yet but i already started the cosplay d  sry for bad english o/
  the character is not release yet but i already started the cosplay d 
  i mean noxus killed his girlfriend so theres that
  this is guts from berserk d
  yes and 2 have white hair d
  lmao
  anyone knows the shop he bought it from
  judging by the blue parts its from ascos as well as his dark lux costume
  shes thicc but starting below the tits
mcm london
  love this
    were you at the meets i was at mcm satsun but passed on the meets i heard cosplayers got some ingame freebies
  not mine anon wouldnt know
  seeing that sven cosplay in person actually gave me palpitations genuine cosplay goals
  that pic definitely doesnt do it justice
  that looks really cool post a pic when finished
      chubby arcade sona is real  that moment when you realize that dreams do come true sometimes
  those arrows are cool
  mediocre waifu cosplays  chad sven
  sven doesnt deserve either of those cms in his life
  the popstar versions are popular because of an artist named loiza he made a bunch of designs for other champs that had style so people started doing groups of his designs lots of garter belts
otafest otafest

how the hell is this thread from a year ago still alive   just how slow is /cgl/  confirmed dead board
  not as bad as you think this thread is just constantly getting bumped and saved from death
  you shoulda seen last years ax threads
  dayum who is that
  
any first k/da skin line cosplays happen
any halloween cosplays
  oh please dont  the clip is released and all my feed is full of i want to cosplay kda girls who never actually tried to play the game   one of them thought that the girl with glasses is vayne     im okay with ppl who saw a concept they fell in love with and immediately wanted to cosplay it and are working on a cosplay while diggin into its source   im okay with i havent played for a while but still want to cosplay  but those hype hungry fuckers god i cant help myself im pissed as fuck
    couldnt find ascos website is it a taobao store
  yes  
  this girl is my fav kayle
just happened to come across this sg miss fortune on reddit she has more pics here    i think she really suits the champion
  dont selfpost like this please its embarrassing
  that angle makes my eyes bleed  and her your face is too rounded for mf  its not a bad thing in general but doesnt really help the really suits the champion definition
  if you say so why would i post myself here on 4chan lmao no thanks
  this is really neat are the wings part of the costume or are they shopped either way its still a good costume
  k/da skin line cosplays        spiral cats did it but they look pretty poorly made
    i just okay i just really dont get why people are so crazy about spcats
  sure thats why your instagram is in the description of every picture and why youre complimenting this fat thot with a shitty cosplay  please dont embarrass yourself further
    usually i like the studio that makes spcats stuff but this is just pathetic they look super inaccurate
    album removed after being called out for selfposting  kek
  oh fuck i think that thresh is actually a ninja in disguise this was taken moments before the lady on the lefts death
  didnt they do something with sneaky not long afterwards

theres two burlesque shows so this is going to be fun
      i love how this con always self posts about itself
  theyre desperate all signs say its gonna be a ghost town
im just here for the cringe
lol did you really come here and start a shitty self promo thread so you could post a full guest bio no one gives a fuck    ill be at ant its not great but id rather bet on something established than a first year contract that loves to post about itself on 4chan
        hello staff from other cons lets be friends this isnt florida
  then go promote your con in the texas thread neither ant nor anime dallas deserves their own
    bless your heart
okay ad youve proven yourself to be run by retards    anons dont give a shit we will proceed to shit all over it
this actually makes me not want to go to anime dallas now
      im not staff so thats on you
  youre probably a guest then
  hello staff from anime dallas lets not throw other cons under the bus as an excuse to start a shitty thread to try to promote our poorly run shit show
    not staff you fucking retard
    the backpedaling is hardcore
this con had the potential to be really good but it turned into an immediate va circlejerk that realized too late that they need more than their tiny chairman club to run a con and with minimum advertizing they assumed people would show up when they didnt have their shit in order    i wonder how drunk anyone has to get to make it through this
  it no longer works to announce a con then people show up you have to work hard to stand out at all troll posts on 4chan doesnt work
  it didnt turn into one it was built to be one from the start it says blatantly on their website its made of  members of the anime industry
    the blatant elitism in this thread is disheartening cons are fucking cons man just because it doesnt have the creator of my hero academia and a bunch of lolita guests coming doesnt mean you need such a stick up your ass for a 20 convention
  we can say the same thing about the elitism of the people running anime dallas but it wouldnt look good for your con wouldnt it
  hey no one wants to go to your con because its poorly run and you are trying to advertise on 4chan it has nothing to do with your run of the mill guests 20 dollars on a shit show is still 20 dollars lost
    why dont you get your head out of your ass im not staff    i guess you cant understand people just genuinely being excited for a con no wonder no one posts here anymore
  there are like 30 anime cons in the state we dont have to be excited for shitty ones
     said it well if theyre trying to make a good con they need to prove it to gain interest ive helped with a lot of baby cons i actually went to the mini akons all that shit you have to prove youre putting in the effort for it to be worth it otherwise its going to look shitty and right now this looks shitty we dont have to suck it up just because it hurt your feelings
im not really expecting much from anime dallas they rejected higher quality panelists and accepted bottom of the barrel ones which leads me to believe they arent doing much in the way of screening panel or panelists one guy was recruiting panelists for his incharacter cosplay jurassic park vs star wars panel on the nt cosplay facebook group    they have two very shitty berlesque groups attending have watched both they really are bad bad    the concept of a con run by those in the industry sounded good in theory but the final product is looking pretty sad at this point
  thats what happens when you get events run by industry they only let their friends run the show
im actually looking forward to the my hero industry panel
  is the schedule up
    yes its on the website    still no info on the cosplay contest though
  still no info on the cosplay contest though    also looking for this
nothing about the cosplay contest on the website  google has nothing  or social anything  maybe 4chan knows    i am surrounded by idiots
    more like someone internally might post something
  you work for them staff or whatever you are calling your unpaid ass
ant is over once again it was a shit show
so whos going to ad    anyone in the aa
  animedallas  darling in the franxx panel  i guess theyre not going to add descriptions to these things huh    why would people care about english voice actors doesnt everyone watch subs one of their voice actors played an extra in a single mha scene and worked on some vn
less than a week till con and theres still no info besides the bare minimum schedule without descriptions    questions go unanswered on the facebook group    they are begging for staff  volunteers because the rumor is a bunch of staff just gave up and left    i feel bad for anyone whos paying to attend
  they posted in the group yesterday saying that anyone interested in being staff can attend a meeting wednesday with the chairmen and become staff on the spot after interviews     god i thought there wouldnt be a con in dfw worse than ant guess i was wrong
  if we a start a con we can get staff out of thin air  lets not promote anywhere to recruit for staff  we have no idea what were doing
  confirmed it from a friend a group of them quit because the director couldnt give them any info and they dont know what theyre doing at the con so theyre understaffed and the staff they have dont know what to expect i thought ant was bad but this takes the cake
im honestly just going to get out of my house for a few days  will probably just ditch the con and chill in dallas but i love cosplaying and this con im gonna be the asshole playing music through a portable speaker so whatever   also if it turns into another dashcon i want front row seats
  i fucking hate you if youre the mario guy that kept everyone up every night last ikkicon actually i hate you just because youre a speaker guy
they are officially getting desperate and im so glad i didnt enter the cosplay contest at this point
  i fucking hate those mario people i want to punch their loud speakers then throw it off a 20 story building
  im no mario i just want to set up camp in a corner and put on a lil music
    no you want to be a damn road block and point of congestion in the walkways all because you fancy yourself some sort of dj or whatever or youre crying for attention from randos    do everyone else a favor and do it outside or something at least then you wont cause problems
  thats concerning did they ever even announce who the original judges were
    i dont even think rules have been posted so i doubt they have any judges at this point
  wow so they have no judges no mc and no coordinator    how did they even know to solicit you
  im just a panelist like hell i wanna staff a con this poorly organized
  ouch so theyre just mass emailing panelists to be on staff    please report back about your experience anon i gotta know how poorly this thing goes down
i feel like hosting the con in an airport hotel was another bad decision maybe if youre staff itll be free regardless
  completely parking for up to 16 hours  3 day event that is not selling single day passes  most attendees parking will be free    so how does that work then
  will do im just going to see what happens at this point though i will be cosplaying too
voice actors are trying to run a con  what could possibly go wrong    im laughing at this pending disaster
  i dont even think its the vas fault their experienced staff is all incompetent as well
  the experienced staff are also voice actors anon
  no the entire convention is not staffed by voice actors
    theres a few general volunteers but the people in charge are voice actors with little to no experience running a convention  only have experience in being a guest at conventions
  doesnt matter if they arent if the inexperienced head staff of voice actors hire inexperienced substaff then its on them that it sucks so bad going 100 by volunteers and scraping the bottom of the barrel because you couldnt organize better and then letting it cascade into a domino effect of no information going around to any other convention help means that the whole damn thing is going to fall apart thats why they just lost a bunch of staff last minute
cash only for badges on site this shit keeps getting more pathetic
  i dont think anyone with experience would want to work with them after this they seem awful at communication and worse at organizing do volunteers get anything out of this      have they never heard of square or are they that cheap if all goes down by saturday no refunds
  they claim its cash only to maximize line speed but thats going to have the opposite effect     im starting to think theyre just going to take the money and run because they know itll be a shit show
  maximize line speed    lol that only matters if people show up  they claim this is all for charity so it would be even worse if they cut and run with the cash
  having cash means they can flub the numbers and lie about how many badges they sell i dont trust that theyre pocketing at least half of the funds
  i bet they dont have a pos system
con supposedly starts tomorrow what drama is in store
  supposedly theyve found judges/mc my money is on someone saying the wrong thing to the wrong person and a big apology from the guys in charge thanking everyone for showing but this will be the last year  because someone drops the ball
  last year  you mean only year
    they must have found random people most people i know with experience and actual skills judging and running contests wont touch this shit show     dont expect quality if youre planning to compete     not to mention signups are only on friday in person according to their facebook
  didnt they say it was going to charity
  they never said all the profits go to charity
    nvm they did say that still dont believe it though
  probably a bunch of fame hungry kids that think it means something to judge a first year garbage show i wonder if theyll announce them or just not bother along with ignoring every question about their contest    i feel bad for whoever the conned into it too even if theyre just attention seekers theyre going to show up and have no guidelines to just because this con cant even post basic rules
anyone have any idea on what i should do if im having to be dropped off at the hyatt and picked up again each day of the con by someone as the hotel is located within the airport complex
  call and ask the hotel if they can validate a ticket from the ticket only lane for a drive through drop off im sure they can if nothing else they can give you an idea of what to expect
hey just saw this on twitter not sure the details anyone else have anything  
          some of the most garbage anons ive seen salty as hell are all first year cons in texas absolute shit shows or something
      yes the hotel will validate everything theres signs saying all parking and tickets are free
  anon i dont know what your deal is but its obvious youre connected to the con somehow and its in your best interest to stop posting now
  that guy is at a lot of texas cons hes not a registered sex offer he was investigated but never charged he can legally be there
    anon theres generally some expectation that first year cons wont be amazing but this one in particular is turning out to be especially bad
  thanks i wondered if it was true or not before i bothered retweeting
  no not all first year texas cons are bad but 95of them know that you need to take credit cards for payment unlike this piece of shit
    hes a pretty big staple in the texas convention circuit ive looked him up in the past but he has no actual record from what i understand all charges were dropped and an apology was given to him based on previous googling
so it looks like anime dallas is turning out to actually be a ryan kopf show instead of being put on by voice actors     
  that doesnt sound right this says that guy is based in the midwest where did you find information he was running it caps
    let me get right on that
    i went to the staff meeting and it was clearly the voice actors in charge        i agree thats a stupid decision
who the fuck are all you anons hating on this show its cheap and supposedly goes to charity i really dont care about that because how are you going to donate money when badges are 20 go have fun are yall so broke that 20 yes its 40 at the door too bad is too much or are yall going anyway and just bitching
  you would think at this point staff would know to stop posting and yet
  its 20  its 20  well actually its 40 if you get it at the door like 99 of people    lol
  lol ur con suxx ass
      you two anonfags arent going to make me stop posting go ahead and keep wasting your time though and im not staff but i am doing a panel
  tip top kek m8 enjoy your 2 person audience
  sorry no one is coming to your panel anon next time apply at a con that isnt a colossal shit show
      post post post cons good so far so we
  ok staff
surpringly smelly for a low crowd day i heard they have 1500 people but there arent even half that dance circles in the halls couldnt find two of the panel rooms until i asked staff the panel rooms are huge and half are empty  opening ceremonies was pretty bad this con isnt very organized
  dance circles  fuck i wonder if anyone knows the choreography to the torture dance
    theres a jojo pose panel sunday so maybe
    i agree smelly but theres still plenty of kids here
  too many kids and theyre all awkward tempted to not go back
  you were never an awkward kid too
  your either a kid or pedo if you can tolerate awkward or loud con kids
    could be a dad instead my kids are young but i get what being a kid is about
    if youre one if those 21 bible study losers youre at the wrong con dude the ticket price pretty much guaranteed the con would be mostly teenagers
  also true im just people watching them because theyre having fun and i dont want them to get hurt but i also am not con babysitter and theres not much for adults to do at this con its mostly just kids running around without parents
  yeah i made a mistake thinking there was hope i just wanted to get one persons autograph im all good with a free weekend
i didnt know about anime dallas until i found out about it just now by accident why does it exist we already have ant during the fall season in fact it was two weeks ago and there are already two large cons in the area akon in fort worth and anime fest in dallas though its debatable whether afest is a large con why do we need anime dallas
    because ant is a mess and this is cheap
im working at a friends art table and bought a wristband for the day every time i run and errand and reenter the vendor hall the badge checkers yell at me demanding to see my badge    staff needs to let their volunteers know that there are wristbands
  because greed and competition       there are wristbands holy shit
  yepa mere 5 less than a badge
  because of butthurt voice actors its a spite con
  who are they even spiting this con is so terrible    the cosplay contest wasnt even 30 minutes
    its just cause the voice actors wanna party together on their own terms
    hey at least it started on time less entries will do that to you i guess though
    they barely advertised it and only had signups on friday when most people didnt want to take a day off work since the con isnt big enough to waste a day off on    plus rules  judges were thrown together a few days ago so im not sure what anyone was expecting
  they made their own con because other conventions dont ask them to be guests
  cons arent obigated or owe it to voice actors with victim complexes to invite them if that was the whole reason why the con even happened kiss getting invited to anything ever again    just go back to staffing your shitty con
  how was it then did they ever actually release rules how many entries did they even get
    maybe around 1214 entries
  its probably because theyre so terribly bitchy all weekend today they tried to win over people with fruit snack boxes        it was so small but they has the rules up and didnt link them a friend linked me this morning and im so glad i didnt enter  animedallascom/cosplay
      except half plus of the guests are guests at other cons all the time and only half because of all the newbies great deductions holmes
how was saturday so far for you guys
  better than ant at least
  i find that hard to believe
  jfc who wrote these     be careful onstage runningtacklehugs glomping might not be very safe     smoking is not allowed in the convention center contestants who leave the building for a smoke break may lose their turn to appear on stage     sewing gluing spray painting welding or other construction work is allowed backstage      _
  nayrt but it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be the biggest issue i had was guys who signed up as press to get into the con for free constantly stopping people in inconvenient spaces and interviewing them for some video if youre reading this get some self awareness and get out of the way of people walking assholes
      anyone got a run down on the ground of the differences    game room here at ad is awful i heard they expected much fewer people so ill give them this cosplay contest short as hell and i couldnt find ops    reg ok staff on a power trip anything like that
    uggh im incoherent i meant at ant reg was fine here staff too were they ok at ant i didnt go to that obviously and only came here cause it was cheap not let down for 20
  seconding this anime north texas is a dumpster fire and despite issues with staffing anime dallas has been a fuckton better
  ant has pretty rude staff especially the ones that help with panel setup and the ones that enforce dress code not to mention the incompetency of letting a known pedophile into their con thats just what i hear though    other than that they might be equally unresponsive and shorthanded i like the venue at ad a lot better than ant and in a way it kinda makes up for being bored at a con since you can just walk in circles if theres really nothing to do where ant just feels like just a big room with a bar in it but incredibly crowded
well ad has been boring but its not as bad as yulecon so i guess theres that
  a paper sack could be better than yule con so thats not really a ringing endorsement      so youre saying both cons were lackluster but you were ok wasting 20 bucks on ad because you could walk around an airport hotel your standards are low
  they didnt say they were okay with it they said the venue was better which it was they were both awful cons but i noticed the con let in those panelists who never get accepted from other cons for good reason a handful were great most were just voice acting circlejerks
        everyone wants to be a voice actor guys everyone lets flood cons with panels about it    except the voice acting world is already flooded so you are unlikely to ever get a chance but hey come to one if 20 how to voice act panels and maybe your dreams will come true    spoiler alert they wont
ad  ant but that isnt saying much onwards to ikkicon
  more disappointment
  im going to be drunk for most of it and passing out mini bottles plus its within a few miles of my work thinking about setting up dance circles whats the attendance like i hear its on a stay decline unfortunately
  yeartoyear it keeps getting smaller
  i heard people talking about ad year 2 and laughed a lot how is this going to go again
    based on this year pretty fucking ok notice i didnt say well but nothing was majorly wrong like the cosplay contest for example was tiny but it was on time and acceptable based on what my friends say    given im giving them a lot of credit for being first year    but the other cons here have problems that dont exist here yet so year two will bethe crash or it will somehow be glorious honestly the voice actors putting it on probably have  and can just use  to fix problems next year unless they do something stupid like book guests they cant afford or try the convention center theyre golden
  theyre going to need to have a consistent staff and actually plan in advance if they want to be better at all no more finding cosplay judges 3 days before the con no contacting volunteers 1 month before figuring out their line issues they thought boxes of fruit snacks handed by the chairmen was going to placate everyone and im damn amused by that    i think its going to stay like allcon small and niche until they figure their shit out
what do yall think the small cons in texas can do to improve asking as staff for one but not going to say which    arcade games  japanese guests japanese vas musicians idols or fashion designer  different american guests  certain events formal dance rave  industry panels and events  parties and alcohol  18 stuff
  its obvious youre with ad or maybe okashicon just stop
  youre asking seagulls for advice you are sad
  hi ryan
  the biggest panel draw for me is actual japanese industry directors writers composers if they actually worked on a good anime im interested obviously thats harder as a small con while i am a dirty dub watcher american vas dont really get me excited unless its a big name like steve blum 18 stuff is also always appreciated generally more entertaining than the usual panel chaff    i love video games but i almost never go to arcades at cons unless theres something really unique there i cant get elsewhere like jap rhythm games that arent ddr if a con didnt have this i would not care but i know it also does have its crowd same applies to anime viewing rooms if i wanted to watch anime i can do that at home without paying for a badge but its low effort so i get it    the rave is a must have for my friend group personally speaking but dont cheap out get someone good its the difference between 15 people bobbing back and forth and a packed room making the floor shake we also tend to party and drink and stay late so if the venue is friendly to that then even better    and to be fair i might not line up with the usual poster here i generally just pop on this board before/after a con out of curiosity ive been to dozens of cons and i generally just want to have fun with friends while dressed like an idiot if the con and the venue can facilitate that then ill be happy
  organization thats it thats literally it email panelists in advance post contest and event guidelines in advance keep your website updated with new information communication is extremely important with putting on any event especially if a lot of people are involved you can have the shittiest guests but if people believe in your event and you listen to their concerns and keep them informed then at the bare minimum you can have good fanrun panels    the biggest issue with ant and ad is a lack of communication if staff and attendees arent on the same page things get out of whack volunteers drop out people start getting really frustrated    you can expand and do really fun and elaborate stuff if you want and thats great but it will fall apart without a good team of staffers and volunteers that do their jobs and communicate with each other and involve attendees in the process
  thats because they sold out of pre printed badges from what i read      this is good advice and truly my biggest problem with ad was the lack of communication as a panelist it really left me not knowing what to expect and had me dreading what day id be needed when i couldnt attend the first day also as a cosplayer i completely forewent the idea of competing in the contest because i had absolutely no idea what to expect    i also think that advertising proceeds going to charity but not clarifying which until the last day of the con was unfair to attendees that and the advertised formal ball was never really a thing or even addressed that it did not happen    my problems aside the staff was really kind to me when i had some problems and went out of their way to help i know this probably outs me a bit but my weekend would have been a disaster without everyone helping me my bag went missing including wallet and badges and i was given a replacement by the con and i appreciate the kindness in general i was shown by volunteers and friends too and in the end it was returned and nothing was missing either so theres that on my end    i hope they can take the mistakes they made this year and learn from it because i get the impression that they are nice people but not exactly readily able to look past the excitement they had to run this con when they were so under prepared and unwilling to listen until it was over if they fix it by next year maybe ill be better    i did enjoy my weekend so ill be giving it another try again
  maybe itll be better sorry on mobile
      ad posted a feedback form be so why the fuck would they be asking you
  what do yall think the small cons in texas can do to improve  as others have said strict organization and early notification to panelists  better artist alley/dealers rooms this isnt a problem at akon or san japan but i see lots of small cons really underestimating how entertaining a large dealers hall and artist alley can be ikkicon im looking at you a big part of this too is to make sure the dealers and artists you allow in have a good variety of goods dont allow 30 tables of people selling plush alpacas or an artist alley full of only people selling prints    and lastly the rave and formal both are very important the cosplay show too of course that goes without saying i have friends who will go to cons just because of the rave or formal where to them the rest of the con is just a bonus
  no they anticipated selling out and offered the wristbands in hopes they wouldnt they only ordered 2k badges      maybe because someone on the staff at ad literally started this thread as an advertising attempt
anyone here fond of attending the smaller cons closer to home im personally going to daisho con this coming weekend and im pretty psyched theyve got a decently sized cosplay contest and the vendors are usually pretty solid anyone else
  i have only ever been to smaller cons im going to have to miss daisho but i think ill be forgoing detour to go to no brand in the dells
  never been to bigger cons just wish smaller cons had better panels fish i could make friends and stop being autistic
  ill be your friend anon
sabakon and level up expo in vegas a very fun small cons
  if you talk to people at cons not the overly retarded ones theyre generally pretty welcoming stop by a cosplay meetup or a panel about one of your interests and mention that you came alone dont force it and i think you should be good go ahead and ask if you could hang with them too  also join any facebook pages for the con too i know a lot of people hate it here but it is a good way to kinda see meetups and tag along
shutocon in michigan used to be my favorite small con before it became a shitshow i also love yeticon in ontario
  have you been to dokidocon in kalamazoo i heard thats a nice small con
hamacons minicon was pretty decent this year id of liked better stuff in dealer room but for the mini i wasnt expecting 3 day con vendors with better stuff loved them moving the artist alley into different hallway/less crowded the panels were neat hope the panel about japanese beef come back for main con as i and lots of others missed it viewing room had good content the idols were amazing and you could tell they all worked so hard on their dances the mini idols were absolute stars nozomi was amazing as well in her solo but i wish nico alone or nico/nozo did a dance together cosplay contest was good felt the judges did a good job and selecting the cosplays to win ecetera   prices were reasonable for everything       overall good minicon this was my 3rd minicon and im excited to go to main 3day con in july 2019
  i feel like small cons care a lot more about their congoers than larger ones the staff seems much nicer and it seems like they actually take their fans concerns to heart since im not usually a panels/autographs person i like going to smaller cons to just walk around and enjoy the experience
cool ill take the opportunity to gush about my hometown convention if you live in the southeastern canada/northern pa/wny region you probably already know about toracon but its a great con with a lot of really great programming chill people/staff and its just a fun time its ran by the rit anime club and other clubs also run events there im doing my 2nd chess show this year its a scripted show similar to metrocon but more comedy based and thats run by their cosplay troupe the dealers hall and artist alley are comparable to those at larger conventions and its just a whole lot of fun     the drawbacks are that rit hates toracon and have imposed an attendance gap at iirc 2000 and its all on a college campus so you have to drive about 5 minutes to get to other food options as well as hotels that arent the raddison next door however im friends with some con staff members and i know theyre at least planning in the future to move the convention offsite but in the meantime its a great con and if youre in the area i urge you to check it out
  i feel the same been going to this con since their 3rd year next year is year 10 and each year they are always striving to get vas we ask for better panels and a good experience yes they are family friendly but ive heard they are trying to do like awa and at a certain time go more 18
  move it to bufallo and you will hit 5k lots of anime cons started as college but if you are a properly organized nonprofit you should be able to jump to a medium sized hotel
  i know you youre someone i dont know who but i know you hello fellow trouper
  i like to think i know you too even if i dont know who exactly you are hello i will see you at the thanksgiving party friday
    now you need to make a codeword to share at the thanksgiving party so you know youre both degenerates that frequent 4chan      is it common for college clubs to host small cons i dont know the background for a lot of them so i wouldnt know
leaving my texas containment thread to say every thing in the central texas area is mediocre but i still like going to them all anime austin and anime ctx were fun to be drunk in okashicon i was disappointingly sober in
    i went to the main con this year and it was boring i wasnt interested in many of the panels and it seemed empty even on saturday maybe i should give it another shot
went to seishuncon in atl this year very smal around 1500 people was very fun cozy and not too series saturday night got pretty busy and good times were had     i liked it because it gave me a chance to reconnect with old con friends i couldnt normally hang out with at bigger cons
live in middle of nowhere  my state has only two cons a year  one is tiny as fuck only one or halls worth with almost no interesting panels  the other is decent but still tiny  ive gone to only a few conventions and i cant stand the tiny ones and i hate it even more because all the bigger ones seem like theyre far away from me the panels are uninteresting there are so few people to talk to and interact with and going just to get drunk barely seems worth it
  but which state anon
  its owned by ryan kopf so no thx
  kansas theres nothing here
  oof yeah i can believe it
    would you shell out a pretty penny to head down to texas or even oklahoma im sure both have pretty decent bigger cons
  theres fucking nothing in oklahoma except tnt which pales in comparison to akon
    oui you will
go to some small local cons  the sheer amount of underageb
  yeah im planning on going to anime expo finally get to see a big con i want to go to another con before then though something closer and cheaper so i can save up money not sure if anything is big close to kansas and early next year naka kon does not count
went to small con really early this year  the few people that were chatty kept to their social circles  everyone else was just awkward  tiny video game section literally one classroom a few consoles  hear someone say its always like this regarding the vidya room  nothing to do other than play games or get into a room where theres karaoke which i didnt care for  a bunch of stands bought a few posters because fuck it im here i might as well get something out of it    why do people even go to cons if they arent going to socialize a bit outside of your group of friends youre with fellow geeks talk motherfuckers goddamn this is the only negative experience i had at a con so far
  i feel the same specially when people spend all day playing games at con im like there is so much to do tho besides that and i notice alot of first time con goer tend to roam the dealers market till it closes i wish people would just come up to one another and say hey yo whats good my con has also a dnd session which is pretty cool tho if you wanna be stuck in a new universe with a bunch of strangers haha
    cons need something that would promote socializing the game room is ok for that not sure what else there is though
  hey anon im also going to daishocon this weekend though its not the smallest con ive been to sub1000 attendance locals are pretty darn comfy in constrast with bigger cons because youll keep seeing the same people and theyll keep seeing you so they tend to make better atmosphere for talking to people and making friends exchanging comments in passing and then talking more later is a lot less awkward than trying to hold a conversation with someone you just met
1st time daisho attendee here panels were trash but it was fun as fuck talking to see these new people and seeing all these cute cosplays would come back again
does wondercon count as a smaller con
  small cons suck i dont like paying 40 and seeing everything it has to offer in 30 minutes
  first con i ever went to was derpycon 2016 didnt cosplay at that point and went with a friend who was doing a panel for homestuck i got bored and found out there was a board games area and found a huge box of cards against humanity i walked out of the room and asked around if anyone wanted to play i got 2 jjba cosplayers a couple of gravity falls characters and a rick and morty all to play cards together still is probably one of my fondest con memories glad i still speak with them
thinking of going to wintercon in nyc on december 1st and 2nd anyone have any experience with that one
  yeah i do have to say that the panels were weak this year and there were weirdly a lot of noshows not sure if we can blame that on the con though as the panelists are the ones to blame hopefully they blacklist them
  texas needs a new thread some butthurt homophobe trashed the last one and it saged    anyway this is what i love about texasa saturated con circuit with cons for everything from teeny tiny gatherings to huge stuff like comicpalooza and thats why no one will miss am when its gone theres plenty of other events
  oh it will be missed by the aspies who dont leave htx they will fight to the death to keep am around until photos of the top staff being taken away in handcuffs surfaces
  small cons suck i dont like paying 40 and seeing everything it has to offer in 30 minutes    i know i say this a lot but if you wont support your small local cons they cant grow the quality of a local con relies on the local community stepping up if you dont think there are any interesting panels submit one i staffed at least two cons last year that took every single panel submission they got just because no one was submitting anything     small budgets with big venue rental fees means they cant get big name guests small budgets means no arcade cabinets for the game room most of the consoles and tvs are loaners from staff please be respectful of stuff people are letting you borrow theft and vandalism really causes people to stop being generous    the biggest pro of a small con is that most of the people you talk to live close by and its easier to make meaningful friends at small cons sure the cosplay isnt as extravagant the prizes for contests are smaller as is the competition and the guest list is extremely limited but to repeat myself without support it cant grow
i actually travel to this one but cosplay america in nc is a really amazing small con that deserves more attention its for cosplayers only obviously so it doesnt have the usual stuff like video games or voice actors but all of the programming is cosplay panels or workshops run by cosplayers like alyson tabbitha part of me wants it to grow so they can keep adding guests but the small size is an advantage because theres only a handful of people in each panel so you can ask lots of questions
  holy shit is the guy with the weird hair in the back and to the right cosplaying the guy from the berries and cream commercial
    went last year and was really impressed with the quality of the programming definitely learned a lot and it was very chill
previous thread 
here you go gulls finally got around to finishing it theres still two pages missing but they are just ads i might get to putting them in the folder later        permanent link 
  bless you anon thank you for all your hard work and for contributing to the community
  what are some good fabrics for making pleated skirts with
  you are a saint and i hope all of the good things youre wishing for come your way may you always live a happy life seriously youre amazing
  thank you so much you are awesome    where can i find a pattern for a simple jsk thats more otome style ie no petticoat needed like jane marple/emily temple cute
  handmade   if youre not maijuline dont bother
  this thread has always existed in some form lurk more
      im glad to help anons i hope you find it useful and fun to read
  thanks
  someone posted this last thread too fuck off troll
quick question  does anyone know where i can find a free pattern for a low crown 1840s hat i know theres a pattern floating around for sale but seeing how old the design is there might be one to download somewhere i have the perfect coord i want to pair it with for my cousins wedding in a few months so i figured it wouldnt hurt to ask now
i have 2 yards of a border print fabric unfortunately the border is only on one side of the fabric so theres not enough fabric to make a full skirt besides doing a bustle in the front or back are there any other creative ways to use this small amount of fabric every time i make a bustle i end up not liking it as much as i had hoped but i cant think of anything else to do
  fairy wish style panel skirt
    or even jsk
  thanks for the suggestion
  there are a bunch of bergere tutorials involving straw hats which you could completely cover in fabricthat was a thing too floating around google is your pal
    the bodices for the dresses are pretty similar to everything in the ons you can still use ons and simply reduce the skirt to 152m instead so that they dont look so heavy and limp without a petticoat     then theres a bunch of non lolita sewing patterns in the different ons as well akio namiki pretty much makes simple girly dresses with circle/flared skirts so they dont particularly need a petticoat vol 2 has a low waist low poof skirt salopette and a yoked miniskirt vol 3 has a hnaoto tube dress and this other boobless dress vol 4 has a yukata vol 9 has sailor outfits and you can pretty much reuse the accessories and outerwear patterns to coord with as well        youre awesome thank you so much
mfw when thinking about my fabric to completed project ratio  the worst part is i want to buy even more i fucking love unwrapping that sweet yardage and thinking about what it could become
im sure its asked in every homemade thread but where can i find scans of the pattern pages of ons
  this is the life of someone who sews i ran out of my allocated storage space so am on a nobuy
  the thread literally started with someone posting a translated scan of volume one in almost every other past threada link to most issues was posted use the archivegoddamit
  the translated scan doesnt have the pattern page included dumb ass  im specifically looking for the pattern pages
  theres japanese pattern book called princess dress sewing all the patterns are very otome friendly
  tomoe shinohara sewing books are also great
  most people dont scan them because they are so large and awkward you also can usually draft your own pieces from the pattern pages with the measurements they provide if you want the patterns and the scans of the book you really should be buying the book
  do you mean the pattern sheet you want the whole over 1m x 1m sheet scanlated buy the book if you cant survive with the instruction of those scanlations those are really easy
  ah i just needed the actual name for this thank you
      this is me but i also need some lavender fabric to make something sweet for halloween so i bought more fabric plus even more fabric for the contrast collar and then the lining whoops    im not actually sure i have enough time to finish my dress
  other anons are right no one really scans them the pattern sheets are scanlated for vol 1 tho something with to do with it being unavailable for sale check the archives you lazy moron or just buy it
  thats nice ill search more about it do you have one anon id love to see the summary of it
  nvmd just found it ill probably buy one thanks
  bless you anon
this might have already been brought up but i noticed the ons zip from the last thread is missing 4 would anyone happen to have it also would anyone happen to have just the pattern scans it looks like only 2 has them
  may you find your dream dress in pristine condition for an extremely low price anon
  is that blog yoursanon pleasekeep it going blogs are much more permanent than tumblr or ig postsbetter for valuable info
has anyone had any success with handknit things like cardigans or socks im trying to find some good patterns but not having much success
  i have knitted some winter socks but the pattern wasnt in english what kind of patterns are you looking for maybe modify some good one
    someone asked for knit bolero patterns before and another anon dumped a bunch of patterns i saved a few that i liked on ravelry but i havent gotten around to making them    gonna dump a few links/pics but since i havent tried any of them i cant really say if its good    
    
    
    
    
    last pattern    
    also saved this pattern bc look at it but the pattern isnt available on ravelry itself    
  yep its mine ive been trying to keep it updated but as you can see my posts are far between ill keep at it though and i have no plans to remove it      wow nayrt but thanks for the dump anon some of these are amazing
  i didnt have anything particular in mind im in between projects and was looking for something new sock patterns would be wonderful all the ones i have are pretty plain and boring      oh man these are amazing thank you
  depends how you want the skirt to sit  do you want the pleats to be crisp and need to be ironed or do you want them to be softer to be honest fabric type seems to mean less and less these days compared to just seeing and touching it in person as there is so much variation in the way fabrics are named marketed etc that being said a midweight twill weave will take to crisp pleats better than say a lighterweight suiting fabric designed for more movement even though both are fine to make pleated skirts with it really depends what you want to do  i am planning a dress with a box pleated in a lightmediumweight satin brocade which will look very soft
  fair warning drops patterns are awful really confusing instructions as a rule and stupid construction
  anon  is right that it really depends on the kind of skirt you want to make and the specific fabrics qualities one thing about fabrics with a higher polyester content though is that you can kind of melt folds into it with heat so if you want permanent crisp pleats that dont need to be ironed after every wash it might be an idea to go for a nice poly all my brand pieces with indestructible pleats are 100 polyester
any smaller knitting ideas for leftover yarn i have already knitted few hats so other ideas would be great
  rosettes are a cute idea or little fuzzy roses
  how much yarn anon it also really depends on the yarn but  here are some ideas   gloves /mittens headbands/ear muffs socks detachable collars detachable cuffs wrist cuffs ankle cuffs think of babys detachable fur pieces for their shoes or lace pocket covers needleweight yarn opens up even more options
      aaand mood is having a storewide 20 off sale please restrain me i am not even in america right now
  heavy breathing
    dang thanks for the heads up both patterns seem to have good reviews from people who have made them so i thought theyd be okay
are there any sewing books other then ons gosu rori and that ones listed above in the thread
any gulls get their hands on the latest ons yet any scans
  you can just buy it anon its not that expensive
i always seem to have trouble finishing off sewing projects  im working on a jsk and its around 80 complete when i try it on i dont feel excited i just feel ugly i end up feeling ashamed of what ive made it may just end up as another incomplete project in my box of abandoned fabric scraps    i understand that it takes years of practice in order to draft a pattern and create an item of clothing and i know its not going to happen overnight    i just want to make something cute that i can wear in a coord
   you can consider that the reason why you think its ugly its because it is unfinished try motivating yourself that it will look better when its a complete pressed piece
  yeah there a bunch out there are you able to shop trough amazon japan if you click on any ons you can check on the related books section a lot of titles
    a few blogs and ebay sellers have photos of the dresses that are included if thats what youre after     i think anons may have stopped scanning it altogether so that people actually buy the magazine otherwise sales drops and we dont get another issue
    i always struggle when i hit 80 completion too i dont know if we have the same issues though    in my case i just suck so bad at designing clothes and choosing things that go together and the 80 mark is when the dress looks real enough that you can really start to feel the print is goddam ugly some stuff just doesnt work the skirt is too long or the cut is just too stupid    at least catching it at 80 is good then i can change the trim chop half the skirt off abandon stupid design elements change whatever other details my last project i actually completed it then realised the skirt portion is stupid ugly so now i have to rip stitches and overhaul the skirt ugh     as for drafting a pattern and crating items of clothing well theyre very different skills pattern drafting to make sure clothes fit well is one skill sewing fabric solidly together is another skill if those are the portion you have difficulties with then id suggest buying easytosew patterns first so that you can work on sewing fabric together to make solid quality clothes that way you dont get to the end of the project and find out its bad because it fits badly    then once you have the sewing portion down pick up a book on pattern drafting and work on drafting your own patterns youll be able to focus on making sure the pattern actually fits without worrying its your wonky sewing that makes it look bad working on one skill at a time will make it easier to improve because youll be able to pinpoint whats bad and work on it    good luck anon dont give up but also have a battle plan pinpoint whats wrong with your failures and work to fix it so that you can improve instead of just sewing random things over and over
any sewing gulls have a good source for double sided velvet/velour ribbon im hunting and there dont seem to be many options
    i generally hunt taobao when i run out of other places helps that im not american so its cheaper to ship from china to me than other places 包邮双面天鹅绒丝绒带 will get you doublesided velvet      this is the last shop i used        quality seems decent one of them accidentally went through the washing machine and survived only issue was one ribbon being out of stock and the problems of internet shopping i have trouble figuring out how thick the ribbons are
  do you not have any local stores that would stock for fashion students or even bridal or prom dresses diy stores my local store just started catering to that group but they kept all the extras
is there a male equivalent of ons
tfw you find great fabric buy it and at home think its not that good  i had motivation to sew but now when i look at the fabric i just think it will look horrible
  ons book 6 8 and 12 all have some ouji patterns check which ones you like most 12 has the most options and has a dedicated spread
  i get this too but i guess its because i take ages to complete anything and by the time im almost finished with a project my standards and tastes have improved and im disappointed in my early design/fabric choices
  nayrt but did those in 8 and 12 come in mens size
    just buy better fabric    tfw thats how i ended up hoarding fabric
  theyre in japanese womens sizes
  sorry but no you could probably find similar patterns from simplicity or mccalls the only unique one would be the vest take some inspiration from the ega/ouji thread and search through their websites or catalogs in joanns to see if you can find something that will work you can always add the details to an existing pattern  
  thanks for the source and the keyword and its good to hear it survived a wash thats pretty important to me i handwash a huge amount of my wardrobe so surviving water is a plus       i live in the boonies the best ive got is joanns and since im using it for brand alterations id rather cast a wide net
had a halloween dress planned with a painted motif to be traced off stock artwork but almost every planned meetup in oct seems to have been moved up i think im gonna have to skip the painted motif and go with a plain dress but i dont know how to balance black x lavender if the motif is gone pic sort of related to what im going for but a lot simpler    also looking for advice on sewing a seam on chiffon thats along the bias the bias makes it stretchy and breaks my stitches i did the inside seam using zigzag but how do i topstitch it does it look weird if i zigzag the top as well
  im looking for a fabric for soft evenly spaced pleats im looking for a tartan but honestly i have no clue where to start i can sew but im yet to sew lolita
  suiting fabric may be what you want then
i plan on getting a mannequin what kind should i get  are the adjustable ones good enough  should i make one myself   i see lot of tutos about duct tape diy mannequin but i have never seen someone try to use the duct tape mold to turn it into a pattern for a fabric mannequin would it be doable     i also plan to make my first corset circa 1910 and i would like for it to actually reduce my measurements how to size your corset  because you cannot take your own waist buts or hip measurement if you plan for your corset to work like an ancient one and help altering your body shape to fit the desired period fashion silhouette
is there an simple trick to raising a sleevecap up to break up the shoulderline without going full mutton i just find it much cuter and tidy looking compared to the typical sloped armscythe
  if you want a functional corset its better to get a pro to make it for you based on your measurements when you factor in materials and labor and the learning curve its almost a wash unless you want to make corsets indefinitely    that said waist reduction depends on your starting weight if you are fat you can reduce a lot more off your waist at max lace down if you have a natural waist under 30 its gonna be closer to 24 off at max lace down minus about 1/2 from fabric bulk if you are lacing all the way down from the start its too loose    i myself have two custom corsets and there is no fucking way i would have been skilled enough to craft those suckers for proper wear the first was 1910 like you were planing and i ended up hating the silhouette its way too sline and makes you look strange in anything other than period outfits it pretty much requires you to dip forward like in this photo otherwise people will see a strange curve in your lower abdomen which digs into the skin right above your cooch when you sit down also its super tight around the hips so unless you are a pearshape it could make you look topheavy and unflattering curvewise     a victorian is much better for a silhouette that works in any era my favorite is from around 1880 because it was meant to be worn with skintight bodice
  thank you for your answer    i want to challenge myself desu for me the fun is more about the journey and the new technics you learn along the way than the finished product  if i fail with no chance of ever getting it right im going to ask a professional so that i can go to the next step and sew a late edwardian dress but i want to give it a try at least
  np good luck to you if you do get the hang of making good corsets there is decent money and demand to be had if i were you i would start as i mean to go on and use quality materials like a double layer 100 cotton coutil as is traditional and spiral steel boning for extra strength its a little bit extra in materials but the end result will be almost blastproof coutil is usually found from specialty english vendors    also keep in mind that corsets were like modern bras irreplaceable foundation wear the modern trend of wearing elaborate silky patterns on display started as a fetish thing and looks really awful to anyone with a cursory interest in history
  start with a nice pattern if you have no idea about drafting which it kinda seems is the case ive heard good things about truly victorian patterns by my reenactment friends but ive never used them myself use good quality materials like nice coutil and spiral steel bones if youre worried about historical accuracy yes they did have spiral steel circa 1970 and it actually mimics whalebone better than other alternatives whalebone has a bit of flex crosswise unlike flat steel  i like looking at the victoria and albert museum  the mets archives for design inspiration they have quite a few corsets and its always good to look back at actual artifacts   ive made quite a few corsets thus far and i actually started out with a 1920s style corset which i think is a super way to get the technical skills ie making boning channels setting grommets edge binding putting the damn busk in place sewing through thick fabric with having a bit more wiggle room for fitting errors that you cant really afford in the earlier eras or even modern styled corsets if you want to see pictures of construction or of the finished pieces let me know i can always post them ive also got some boned jackets from the 1870s90s that have a similar but different technique if youre interested  good luck
  1920s style corset  wouldnt this be a girdle by this point women widely dropped the corset by 1920 and wore shapeless dresses over their shifts
  ah classic chiffon  pain in the ass  you shouldnt need to sew bias cuts with a zig zag unless the fabric is already stretchy not sure what you mean by breaking stitches but it sounds like your tension may be offfor topstitching finding the right tension and using a super sharp needle are the tricks buy a bunch of sharp needles especially if youre sewing poly chiffon they get eaten up way quicker than you think you should definitely be able to sew it on a straight stitch if your chiffon is particularly misbehaving you can try using the watersoluble stabiliser they use for quilting ive never used it with chiffon but its a godsend for working stupid slippery fabrics like thin knits through my machine
  yes thats the word i think they were still being called corsets even though they look more like modern girdles they were still being constructed mostly in the same fashion as earlier corsets with metal busks and bones and stuff  also its late and by 1920s style im actually talking about like the transitional period between the decades so like 191823 range where we were falling out of the true corset fashion but we hadnt quite abandoned them completely
  pretty sure even girdles were pretty oldfashioned by 1920 as early as ww1 younger women stopped wearing corsets and this only picked up until 1920 where the new shape had no need for it    flappers didnt even wear bras and rigid corsets/girdles were certainly out for almost everyone they had elastic shortgirdles that were pretty stretchy and mostly there to attach their garters when we move into the 3040s we get more full overbust girdles coming back into fashion but even these usually werent boned    i think you may have stumbled upon some sort of niche or bridal wear or got the dates wrong it certainly would have been an anomaly for corsets to be made as before during and after the various wartime shortages and dramatically changing fashions    as an aside i find 20s fashion hair and makeup appalling
  hmmm perhaps i did get my dates wrong ill have to look into it
      and yes i have ordered a pattern but from sewing curvy  ill see how it turns out to be if its detailed enough for me if not im going to try truely victorian as you adviced  there is a priorattire video on youtube where she shows how she makes her corset ill use it for reference but the corset shown there doesnt have a lining and intend to add one for confort and looks if its accurate to the period        a historical costumer that i follow on youtube said that women were still wearing shapewear in the 20s except it was to reach the then fashionable super flat boyish silhouette however it wasnt mandatory anymore like corset were to be considered proper but if you had big boobs and/or a big butt it would have been unfashionable to not flatten it up
i can sew decently but i need help when it comes to materials because im clueless if i want to make a jsk that isnt too heavy or too light with a tartan pattern what fabric would be best i literally have zero knowledge of fabric properties i can tell bad from good though
  you are the opposite of me i am obsessed with fabric but suck at sewing always stick to natural fabrics synthetics are gross  jsk that isnt too heavy or too light with a tartan pattern  a little more detail would be helpful did you at least have a feel or texture in mind a highquality pima/japanese cotton would be closer to the look of something burando personally i prefer to take things up a notch and do something unique and a bit more expensive like use actual twill or flannel maybe even in wool or silk cleaning isnt much worse than normal since most burando is dryclean or handwash anyway    one thing i have found is that in todays world weight really isnt that big of deal when it comes to fabric choice because the sheer number of options and weaves and methods that produce any desired drape and weight in any fiber or blend you could think of even if you end up with something too light this can be fixed with the lining/backing choice  i think this is the minimum you should go quality wise 
  we should team up pick the fabrics and ill make the clothes   well the one thing i dont want it to feel like is cheap plaid shirts that you get from f21 or the like they fall apart after one wash and they always feel like shit    i want it to feel like its good quality and will hold up through wear i dont mind the weight as long as its not light and airy like chiffon
    so i receive the pattern from sewing curvy and its a truely victorian one it comes with a lot of detailed explanation and its multi sized it looks like a very good pattern
  we should team up pick the fabrics and ill make the clothes   hah logistically if that were a real possibility it would tempt me i am really behind in my sewing but have too many projects and fabrics in storage as well as a pipedream of a boutique fashion brand  i want it to feel like its good quality and will hold up through wear i dont mind the weight as long as its not light and airy like chiffon  i mean pretty much anything you sew properly not made of tissuepaper will be better than the garbage at f21 i think you can set the bar a little higher than that construction plays a bigger part in quality and durability than fabric assuming you are spending over 5 a yard on nonsynthetics    it seems you have some idea of the drape you want but no real preference for hand and texture which is incredibly important and makes the difference between a costume and an outfit however this is where stuff gets really subjective and it is your project so you have to go by your conception of what you are trying to create    if this is a burando mimic you are gonna use a smooth crisp cotton almost completely matte printed isnt even out of the question even though i think its a waste if you are wanting just a basic tartan which is easy to find woven    it would help if you would post some inspo photos or the pattern you want to use most patterns explicitly state a range of fabrics they think suitable and from that its easy to narrow down your options as i said before i think a nice cotton or cotton/wool tartan flannel would be cute and add a subtle dimension of texture and drape that would really elevate the end result
any advice for choosing a good sewing class/shop   there are three or four very popular ones where i live and im having a hard time deciding where to go
    look for an independent fashion school if you have one if thats not possible a community college course would be good i find that things associated with a store tend to top out at beginner level a sewing shop will have classes but will focus mainly on actually using the machine
  thats what i need i am a total beginner by shop i mean locally owned not like joanns or michaels i dont have space or money to own my own machine atm and all of the ccs nearby require you to provide everything as well as dont fit with my work schedule im wondering what i should look for in a local sewing/fabric shop and their classes
would anyone know where i can buy lace or what the names of the lace pictured are im looking for taobao shops too because id like to start creating old school pieces
  this is good advice the best teachers at a shop are paintbynumbers pattern junkies who shill their crappy machines i wouldnt recommend them even for beginners
  torchon cluny
any gulls have resources for lolita accessory making   im not great enough at sewing to attempt a whole dress or skirt myself but id love to try to make some accessories wrist cuffs necklaces chokers jewelry hair accessories broaches anything small like that
  i really dont think this is the case most shops here seem very legit some dont even sell machines and focus solely on fabric and notions probably because our local diy scene is very big and healthy pnw i guess ill ask on reddit or something
  have you made accessories before if not just look at some basics cchannel is a good japanese youtube channel with super simple loliable jewellery tutorials which could give you an idea of what you can do making jewellery is actually super easy as long as youre not looking to do metalsmithing or stuff like that  i like making accessories too for inspiration i look at pieces i like on lolibrary and go to the bead store
  anon girdles were still a pretty popular thing even up into the 1960s pic is a 1950s ad they were also how you kept your stockings up with garters    seriously 5 seconds of googling would show you this it really wasnt until the 60s/70s that you saw a lot of women abandoning shapewear
        the accessories start about halfway down i think after the dresses half the links are dead but theres a handful to get you started
    thanks anons for the ideas ill check them out
  ive seen it as crochet or cotton lace too before
  thanks anon youre a right smart one ill see what i can do
  thank you
  if your goal is to eventually make clothing look for a class that focuses more on that  the skillset required for quilting is a little different to for clothes you want them to teach you basically step by step to get from pattern and fabric choice to finished garment not just about the machine and how to use it if you are not able to own your own machine then maybe look for somewhere that also lets you hire time on their machines so you arent chopping and changing each time you go
  if you had read my post more clearly you would see i was saying that corsets were out and elastic girdles came in not that shapewear went out alltogether    i own both corsets and girdles and they are very different beasts
does anyone have any patterns for a bodice with a bib on it im trying to figure out how to add one into the front of a jsk i want to make but its harder than i thought to picture it in my head
dumb question that it may be more appropriate to ask elsewhere where are some good places to get decent fabric online i live in what is effectively the middle of nowhere and outside of one small joanns and a local quilting shop that almost never carries anything fashionappropriate there arent any physical stores within a 15h drive where should i be looking
anyone has tried the cut/sew patterns they have a couple of lolita onesbut in their samples they use completely nonlolita fabric and styling so its hard to tell how they would look when used properly
  what do you mean by nonlolita fabric cutsews are made out of a knit like a tshirt
  no cut/sew the indie pattern company
  that name  i can see lolitas being confused by this for years to come
    i mean you pretty much described why youd end up buying fabric online you just forgot to say exactly what you actually need help with rather than a general shop online    if you taobao someone dropped a list of fabric stores at   if you do japanese sites then rakuten or nipporitomatocom has a lot of stuff you can search for yuwa fabric if you need a start its a manufacturer that makes a lot of cutesy print stuff  if you do etsy then searching for japanese fabric will get you the same cutesy print stuff    for solids and if you already know what fabric youre looking for you can try fabriccom nonamerican spotlight has online shopping for most countries theyre in i think
  pretty sure even girdles were pretty oldfashioned by 1920  idk man sure sounds like youre saying girdles were on the out by the 1920s    polite sage for wtf
i want to sew cute things with this kind of fabric i believe its called sherpa but im having a hard time finding any pastel colors other than pink especially the cute yellow and blue joann always has the pink anyone know a good source to get other colors of this type of fabric
  i think this is just wool    what kind of patterns should i look for if i want to make a dress with a i do declareish bodice i can probably find this in a commercial mainstream patternsome suggestions
  sherpa is meant as a sheepskin alternative which is why its normally sold in neutral colors just buy white and dye it yourself if you cant find the colors youre looking for online
  ooof i dont know how good they would be just based on the fit of the samples on the models the samples look like customer pics from beginner sewers to be frank
  its helps to say their social media handle which is heycutsew to tell the difference
  id go with tea and treadle instead they have proper samples of their dresses sewn up if youre still curious about the heycutsew patterns i think you can download the pdf of the instructions look on the envelope pictures for the website that has the pdf
  may find similar textures labelled chenille minky or boucle
    if you mean the part of the bodice where the waistline makes a little dip in front its called a dip waist not sure that its easy to find outside of vintage old patterns though
  i dont remember specifically which brand butterick or simplicity but those pattern brands have vintage inspired patterns
    even looking at the customer photos i would avoid them beginner patterns is right  but not in the good way in the way where they look like the patterns i drafted as a sewing newbie
  yesthat but for patterns with a v waisthow do you attach a rectangle skirt the pic you posted has a seam down the frontbut i guess thats a circle skirt
  the v shape needs to be drafted into the rectangle so that when you gather it it lines up with the drop waist so you can draw the shape of the bottom of the bodice then cut and spread to the width of your rectangle skirtor do some math and spread the v shape over the width of the front part of the rectangle and draft it in directly
  well that was half my attention during the war a lot of corsets and foundation went out completely girdles slowly trickled in to replace them but not all at once it took into the 30s and 40s for them to become ubiquitous during the war everything was so knitted and fluffy there really wasnt a demand for foundation wear especially after the smear campaign corsets got from various womens health publications     you could easily keep your garters on a belt without the girdle and plenty of women did the new shape in the 20s didnt absolutely require the average women to wear one unless you needed the slimming to keep that flat boy silhouette or were particularly fashionable/famous at any rate my original point was about boned corsets and how they werent at all a real trend by the 20s  announcing sage  you have to go back
anyone else start a project thats meant to be quick/easy but then end up spending way more time and money on it than planned to get it to work
    this has been my entire year im only up to 3 sewing projects this year and only 1 went well  even then i changed it from a longer dress to a shorter one because the longer dress looked frumpy    the current one is a halloween dress but i didnt like the fabric i bought so i bought more fabric but the wrong fabric is already cut so i figured id modify the dress a bit and make another quick/easy dress out of it which isnt going well either and i have to troubleshoot whats wrong with it     tldr one of my quick/easy projects went so badly its spawned a second quick/easy project that is also going badly    also all my october meets got moved up earlier so its already too late to wear the halloween dress    im going to go back to sewing something not quick after this it might actually go better than the quick/easy projects
  once i had in mind to do simple gathered chiffon skirt and lining with elastic waist as i found a piece of fabric with nice print something you could do in few hours max    ended up with highwaist side zipper and tons of lace it took me 2 days to make it
  even if youve missed the meets you could still do a modest photo shoot right i think it would help your confidence once the main project is done to document it and share it with friends theres nothing more frustrating then to spend a lot of time sewing talk about the fact you invest so much time in sewing but then no one ever sees the results      personally i go through this even with normieclothes projects i finally have limited myself to only committing to making smaller pieces or accessories only and funnel my money into purchasing the main pieces i wanted to be a handmade lolita but for me its just that it eats up so much of my time
    no worries the halloween dress is still getting made a big factor is that halloween releases tended to be for fall weather but i live in the tropics so it makes sense for me to sew a lightweight summer halloween dress instead of being stuck buying either a longsleeved op or layering up a jsk for halloween even if i dont wear it this year its still going to come in useful in future october meetups as i dont foresee brands releasing summerweather halloween dresses anytime soon    could probably have gone without all the delays and making a whole extra dress out of it though     thanks for the encouragement youre right ill feel much better once i get the dress finished and can show everyone what ive worked so hard on
  all the damn time im currently stuck partway through a simple sundress project having realised the fabric i bought for it is a bitch and a half to work with
        fabric being a bitch was what spawned me to ask the question haha this skirt is made out of a knit fabric and doing the scalloped tier was a bitch although that also had to do with my measurements that bottom ruffle was added to lengthen it and i decided to do a zip waistband for some reason even tho elastic and knit basically go together which i have to do again because its too big after all that i just wanted some casual lolita
if all the ons books are basically the same level of pattern difficulty which book is most worth getting for a gothic lolita are the patterns mostly sweet cuts and styles which volume has the most variety
    that looks pretty neat for being made from a knit fabric im using crinkle cotton at the moment and the fabric has so much give i just want to tear my hair out any advice on dealing with stretchy fabric          its kind of hard to recommend a single volume quite a lot of them have a mix like a cutesy muumuu dress being in the same volume as well as a longsleeved op styled as a nun witch and nurse plus a fair number of dresses could be done gothic with the right fabric and trim obviously not the highwaisted cutesy stuff but a fair number of the classicstyle floral dresses could work as gothic in a different fabric    theres a nice variety of things but quite frequently the same cut so sometimes theres things like a long and short version of the same thing same dress with minor variations or a blouse and op with the same pattern    you might be better off looking through the available patterns and then getting whichever volume has the most patterns that you like misscarolbelle or lolitasewingpatterns usually has the picture pages keep in mind that volumes 14 and 7 are a bit hard to find
is the sizing table on every ons book the same the only info i can find is an outdated lj postand i remember seeing a maijuline post mentioning that in the more recent books the patterns fit her loosely when they used to fit her just fine
    this is mildy surprising comparing 2 and 9 they arent vol 9 is 051cm bigger in some measurements     if you let me know which volumes youre after i could post a photo of the tables though for vols 17 it might be easier to look through the scans aanother anon uploaded    
  do you mean this post  she says about this pattern from ons8 fitting like a sack but i cant remember seeing her having said anywhere that shes sewn patterns from earlier issues    if you look at her next post she has worn photos of it it looks like just too much ease isnt the issue  its baggier at the waist than higher up on the bodice which isnt how theyve made it look in the photos in the book and the waist is a fair bit lower at the back than at the front such a shame because she did a lovely job on the construction
  noiirc it was a different oneabout a dress maybe it was an instagram story so we cant see it now /    im a bit bigger 4cmexactly than the chest measurement in the original sizing tableso i was wondering if in the newer volumes i could fit size l without making adjustments while keeping the waist measurement the sameim loosing weight so theres still hope if you are able toplease post a pic of the table in volume 9 i really like the idea of the dorothy buttoned dressand since the full instructions are posted onlinei could make a muslin without spending 20 in the book first
  ill do you one better tomorrow ill take a photo of the table and measure the pattern pieces and find out what the finished garment measurements are
does anyone know which patterns are in otome no sewing 13 i saw a negative review for it on amazon japan
  okay so the bust measured at the underarm is 982cm when finished pic related is the table from ons9      lolita sewing patterns on facebook has a full scan of the patterns available
    if its your bust that doesnt fit you might want to look into how to make a full bust adjustment anyhow opens up the door for many more patterns to be available to you    plus ive only made a handful of things from ons but most of them the bust is pretty tight while the waist is really loose its generally okay to wear but itd probably have looked better if i bothered to actually make some adjustments before sewing
  i dont have facebook
  ill dump for you when i get home tonight sorry i tend to forget not everyone has fb
    theyre on tumblr as well same name    lolitasewingpatternstumblrcom
an entire year before more ons oh well did anyone snag anything cute while mood was having their sale
is anyone else planning christmas dresses already    im kind of stuck for ideas most of the christmas fabric ive seen is kind of tacky i dont really want to wear them i also dont want to do snowflakes or reindeer print either though i did a dark green dress last year but apparently nobody really caught on that its a christmas dress so i dont really know what to make next
this is kind of off topic but do any of you have etsy shops or anything  if there were etsy shops selling custom made plain ops i would eat that up
  you could go for a tartan or velveteen fabric in christmas colors and make a cute applique on the skirt as the deco
  i dont have an etsy but i take commissions if youre interested i can drop my email and send you a link to my portfolio most of the commissions i take on are for dance or historical costumes but i love sewing for lolita
  i own too many christmas prints already but what about a christmas ornament/gift theme thats something reasonably appliqueable if you dont like any of the christmas fabrics
      i really like these ideas probably wont do the velveteen but i think a dark green and red tartan has plenty of room to be styled old school with black cluny lace or a newer modern cut and isnt too obviously kitschy    the ornament/gift box applique idea is pretty good too though ill probably put it on a seperate bag instead of on the same tartan dress at least ill have the option of changing bags if i feel my outfit is too much or not enough    thanks anons that really helped
  this is my experience with ons patterns too according to the table i should fit their m size pretty well but if i dont adjust the patterns they always end up squishing down my bust a bit while being a good inch or two too big in the waist now i always measure the patterns on the sheet before deciding on a size and so i know in advance which parts need to be taken in
    thank you
two pairs of flannel bloomers with matching headbands i havent put the elastic in because i figured id offer custom sizing the bows could use a little tweaking and my corners arent perfect but other than that im happy im thinking about putting them up for 40 on fb concrit
  the matching headbands are a super cute idea especially for a roomwear set that said your topstitching isnt 100 there yet  its not very straight on the bottom of the bow tails as well as on the waistband casing and the bottom hem of the bloomers im assuming these still need elastic put in everywhere i wouldnt say youre ready to sell yet imo you need more practice with the machine before you do that i would make a bunch more pieces for practice and then maybe sell the early works for clearance to get some money back for material spent    its a really cute starter project but lolitas or otherwise jfash peeps are going to have high standards so you dont wanna crash and burn to start off
  im here for honesty not asspats so thanks anon ill sell these at a reduced price and keep sewing good to know what i need to work on
this is maybe a very silly question but what would you consider essential for having before you start out sewing lolita dresses/mainpieces     are there any things that a beginner might overlook    what do you wish you knew before you started making your own lolita stuff
  practice on cheaper materials because youre going to make mistakes keep practicing prewash your fabric and cotton lace sew the ends of the lace to keep it from unraveling get a good iron make crafting friends
        i think not treating lolita handmade as its own seperate hobby is the big thing the designs are different but really youre still sewing a dress blouse elastic pants/skirt or whatever stick strictly to lolita sewing patterns/designs but for techniques and howtos you can simply youtube/google regular sewing tutorials instead of searching for something specific to lolita    essentials depends on where youre starting someone whos put together a couple of things can jump straight into otome no sewing and find it really easy but if youve never touched a sewing machine you should start with learning your machine then sew up pillowcases/totebags before attempting simple dresses focus on learning one new thing at a time so you dont get too many difficult things all going wrong at once    readers digest complete guide to sewing probably covers every technique under the sun so its very useful to have its very dense though lots of tiny text id use it together with youtube to figure out the techniques you need     easiest fabric to start with is cotton stay away from cutesy prints in fact id strictly stick to oldfashioned florals or solids when starting out    what i wish i knew was what actually worked on my body most of my rework focuses on dresses that turn out exactly how i want but it still looks kinda awful on my body i guess this is also advice that you should stop and review your work along the way be willing to make changes if it doesnt look quite right plus learn to figure out whether its your sewing thats bad or the design just doesnt suit you    also be kind to yourself if a project bogs you down and becomes a drag its totally okay to scrap it throw it out and go something else do not rush a project start holiday projects way earlier than you need to cutting corners generally has bad results    hope that helped
  assuming you have basic sewing knowledge the easiest way to start sewing lolita is to stick to lolita patterns in the beginning like otome no sewing or ive heard good things about the pattern company cut//sew although ive never tried them otherwise you risk getting overwhelmed with too many parts of the project fabric selection and sewing skills are hard enough tasks to accomplish for a new sewer you dont want to add in trying to modify some random burda pattern into something passable   dont be afraid to practice on shitty ugly fabric like thrift store or ikea bedsheets its a good way to get those skills built up without worrying about the finished piece looking good or wasting your money and fabric on something you dont like  once youre ready to make your first dress id pick a nice cotton sateen for your fabric fabriccom has a nice selection in good colours its cotton so its easy to work with but it has a softer drape than quilting cotton or broadcloth and is better suited for apparel  dont be afraid to screw up and have fun
  thanks anon im just starting out with sewing lolita items and this makes life so much easier
how much ease do i have to add to my mesurement for a fitted bodice 
  thank you
  i agree with everything the other anon said and i would not be willing to pay 40 for wonky stitching     are you planning to elasticate the headbands in future as well it would definitely put me off to have to tie them on my head as im used to the elasticated towelling ones that you use to hold your hair back to do makeup and skincare and if im going to sleep or lounge about with a headband on i dont want to have to fuss about tying it or adjusting it
  its not something ive thought of doing because i actually prefer nonelastic ones but im not my customers so they might prefer the elastic kind i should try making them thanks anon
  and one thing more to remember start simple simple simple simple start with the simplest designs many firsttimers myself included are tempted to try something elaborate right out of the gate start with simple skirts simple jsks and work your way up
3 months left lets get this party started    what cosplays are you working on right now  what are your ribbons looking like right now  what guest are you hoping for    what are you looking forward to most from the con
when did the ribbons galore sale go up last time im waiting for that but i dont want to cut it close
whats ala like ive never been to it and it looks like its a lot of fun
  its chill and fun a good amount of ppl lots of parties    tfw had to refund my ticket because ill be vacationing in asia and dont get back til the day ala ends
  if you order right when it goes up it should be fine blame ala for moving the con up so much in january
  cheeki breeki
dont eat anything that isnt pie at marie callenders been there 2 alas in a row and both times my food has been cold and/or bland
see location  literally just an hour ride from where i live    i thinking i should rent a car so no one knows where i live
  jokes on you i went to maries breakfast lunch and dinner for 3 days straight earlier this year for ala and had a very pleasant experience
  what i think is amazing is that the marie callenders microwave dinners from the grocery store taste better than the versions at the actual restaurant
  haha same
i heard ala is a party con is that true
  youll still enjoy it even if youre not into parties but for the most part it is its an older crowd and really everyone i know only goes for the parties
how do you design your ribbons
3 months left until ala  jfc that was fast  time to save money and get ready to die
reminder that most ribbon places price match was able to price match ribbon galores sale to pc name tags ribbons   ribbon galores ribbon adhesive is crap and will ruin your chain if you dont have duct tape on the back
  popped my ala cherry a few years ago  go to the radisson for the gaming rooms  people drinking in the hallways  vomit caked toilets and sinks  party con  more like a goddamn den of debauchery
  goddamn den of debauchery  you say that like its a bad thing
   three months  christ time went fast fortunately it looks like it wont conflict with my schedule this year      mediumsized con manageable crowd
got a new job and then started eating bad and gaining weight rapidly and ala is only 3 months away
cant wait to throw my annual yugioh room party again would it be super illegal or just mildly illegal to host bettable money matches later in the night

  tfw its right after ces  gonna go from tech parties straight to anime parties
mfw i might have to go alone   tfw tried to go alone last year but chickened out last minute    i hate being such a weenie

    probably just like three or four illegal
  what department
  people will bet money on solitaire

anyone going to this next week i know theres a few of us out here    honestly looks overall pretty underwhelming for a 25th anniversary otafest just always looks so much more fun
  animethon just always seems so generic otafest has some character
  im going just to fuck some girls to be honest but im also looking forward to see how animethons 20th anniversary plays out at the shaw conference centre this year
  
should i go to ar
  might as well what else are you going to do
do you gulls do any meetups at cons im new to the vancouver area and will be at anirevo this weekend id love to make some friends
does anyone know or have experience if merch floors accept usd specifically anime revo
  or do most of them accept card
  they will take usd but you will get ripped off   most vendors take card nowadays
pieces of head broke off in ossoyoes during noon because 40 degrees    anyone at ani revo gonna pack a glue gun i can borrow for fixing since the tape dont work
  i will be going alone i dont mind having a meetup or whatever
    also headed there alone id love to meet up and have a little chit chat ill be there all three days
how is day one going for everyone at anirevo im enjoying it so far this is a pretty chill con at least for a friday    if we did a meetup when and where would you want it to be id schedule it myself but i dont really have my bearings yet
    the blue stage has stability and audio problems i could barely hear the performers on stage no line con aside from the vendor hall opening
  best time for a meeting would have been today or tomorrow a lot of people skip out on sundays as for where anywhere that has something that can be used as a landmark maybe next year i can organize a meetup but this year im stuck at work the last time i went to ar was the year before they switched halls so i dont even know what would be a good landmark around there im at work every year unless i miraculously get days off approved
  i heard there was an animethon after party is that true
whats the party scene like at ar were borked waiting for the dance party to start is anyone still around
  bored
  im mostly looking forward to the miku concert and cosplay contest since im entering but otherwise its 100 and hang and chill con at least the shaw is closer to some good areas for cosplay photos of you feel like going off site for shoots
  im excited for the vocaparty too also what are you cosplaying as
  im doing alkaid from hack hoping i can finish though since i had to go out of town for the long weekend and couldnt bring any of it with me to work on
  card good that means i can buy merch and charge back
any powerpuff cosplays going to animethon none of my friends coordinated with me my fault and im a lone powerpuff bluff bubbles
everything canadians do is boring and uninteresting even their threads
  dtf
so whats the deal with kimicon first year and its 60 for a full weekend is anyone actually going here i like the idea of an october convention considering nothing much else going on then      im not but i just want to say that is a fantastic cosplay idea
  im curious about kimikon aswell its at the enercare centre which is a big place to be holding a first year con 60 is steep for weekend admission too the thing is that i havent seen much advertising or talk about it and the website seems pretty empty i may go for a day but im getting dashcon vibes from it
  im skipping it the enercare centre is way too big for a first year noname con and i cant see it being anything more than a glorified unplugged or stage select its being run by five marketing friends who want to take advantage of the anime convention crowd but have no management or event experience    basically its a cash grab con
  basically its a cash grab con  this is what i was feeling cant imagine it having a large turnout as much as id love another big con for the end of the year    maybe if it was 40 for the weekend pass itd do better who knows though
anyone going to kawaii land this november   
  i love her costume in the anime hopefully youll be able finish on time because i would love to see it at animethon good luck
anyone going to toronto anime matsuri this weekend its free to attend save for the screenings and im thinking of just chilling
  i thought it was just screenings what kind of other stuff are they doing im planning to go to that plus jmfest plus foolish for ghibli
an delta room get    it sold out in 10 12 minutes faster than last year
  last year it got leaked and most sold out by the release so not faster the page held your room for 15 minutes so i knew ppl who got theirs after a bit
  i managed to get a room thank god
  theres vendors a couple of panels a games room and a dance according to their fb posts
how was anirevo
  why do people still go to an anyway its shit
  largest anime convention in ontario lots of space great socializing/partying lans     panels might be shit but they are pretty much the same everywhere you go for the most part idk why so many people have an obsessive vendetta with an
  lots of people just ghost an now to show off their cosplay the con itself stopped counting ticket sales and went for warm body count
  it was pretty nice always great to see cosplays and other anime fans not many of the panels interested me but teddyloid was awesome
  desu ive thought about not actually buying a pass considering i go there just to play dress up/socialize which is mainly done outside anyways    but at the same time its only once a year and 60 isnt that much for a full weekend event its nice roaming around inside
someone was disqualified from the otakuthon masquerade for wearing fake tan    what a time to be alive
  heh     pics please
  and the tan comparison
  how tf did the judges even know she had altered her skin tone
    wow i expected someone wearing foundation 20 shades darker but this is really mild i feel bad for her i saw her cosplay and it really looked like solid work so its unfortunate that she got disqualified the skin tone fit her so i didnt even realize that she had on darker foundation     ans she didnt even look dark/black to be honest i tan even darker and wouldnt even consider my own tan as darkskinned im southeast asian for reference
  one of the judges asked her then proceeded to go full sjw
  why cant the idiot sjws just stay at an and leave other cons alone
  i enjoyed it a lot there were a few things that went better years before but i still had lots of fun didnt go to much panels though the challenges for the maid cafe were great if youre interested in that
    i cant even finish this i am raging so hard i did a gamagori cosplay and he is tan as fuck in the anime so i got a spray tan ahead of time and even did another self tanner on top of it    how the fuck could anyone take what she did as blackface or even remotely racist
  virtuesignaling thats how    they want to find something to be offended by so they can play the hero and get social recognition as well as feel better about themselves    its pathetic but what else can be expected from people wellenough to attend anime conventions who want to feel better about themselves despite their privilege
  just further proof that the prestige of winning the masquerade is  just blah are the rewards even worth it / a big deal it doesnt seem so from an outside perspective  honestly i wish the masquerade format could change id probably much prefer the japanese style of just having a sprawling cosplay area instead of seeing it from really far away on a stage and feeling tempted to just watch the monitors do japanese cons even have masquerades or anything like that it seemingly occupies a huge portion of the cosplayers day too tucked away in a green room etc  growing up i thought a masquerade was a party not a presentation to be watched   why cant they just call it the pageant or something
  masquerade refers to a masked party historically the term was taken by a japanese man and applied to cosplay seeing as the world cosplay competition finale is in japan i would say that they do have onstage costume competition also we have a sprawling cosplay area too ie the hall at the bottom of the escalators its really similar to comikets cosplay area except for that fact that 1 no changing room at the con and 2 less crowdcontrol
  seen you today shit was funny keep it up
  she doesnt even look brown let alone black that judge is an idiot for calling this blackface she should have turned it around on them by saying that calling this blackface cheapens the harm caused by actual blackface or something like that
  do/ have you had much success with slaying at animethon
  usually most years i have been successful     girls there are an easy lay not to be rude and more often then not youll find that theyll want to suck your dick if you give them some attention already got one number from yesterday just by asking her about her cosplay
  ehhh are they sus though or are they baddies
  dont know what you mean by sus and baddies
  incel
bump any meet up for animethon
  this is like 1 shade darker than her actual skin what do these fucking sjws want to literally lay in the sun and damage your skin to get a tan rather than put some makeup on to get the same effect  cons really are fucking dying with these sjws first an now otakuthon
  havent been to a masquerade in a long time but arent the masquerade judged by the cosplay guest i may be mistaken i still find this ridiculous   she got called out for slightly tanning her skin to look more accurate but if she didnt she could lose points for inaccuracy
  in most canadian masquerades they dont give much point for accuracy they care more about workmanship and presentation than accuracy
  animethon after party at beercade on whyte ave
  people randomly just have sex at cons  cant even meet someone single to talk to    how do people actually meet single people at cons at all most i can get is a shitload of pictures taken of me by actual obese autists and old people who like my outfit ive made a ton of female friends at cons but theyre all engaged or lesbians    not even looking for sex just actually want some kind of connection with someone because i currently live in a shithole town where it feels like not even one person plays fucking video games besides me
  give me some tips bro i just want a cute weeb gf
  saw you saturday are you going again today id love a picture
    oh shit didnt think to check this thread untill nowi broke the head saturday trying for an action shot so i went normal today but heres a pic if you want it
    regularfag here i dont really come on 4chan much anymore     i just came back because i was curious about this too im newly single again and with fanexpo coming up i figured it would be a good opportunity to meet girls    people in toronto though generally are reserved places like montreal and edmonton i can get laid no problem although i avoid the latter because its edmonton lmao but in all seriousness i wonder this too    i cant imagine any girl thats dtf being anything but less than double my weight 511 150lbs or severely autistic to the point that all beauty is forsaken or as you said lesbian engaged hardcore dyke or not hygeneic     do normies who dip their toes in vidya even attend these events i went to a lesser known event last year and i remember being bewildered at the amount of overweight nerds playing in smash bros tournaments on old crts it was like a middle school lunch room with a whole slew of people sitting just hunched over made me bust a good laugh     pic semirelated
  woops this was the semi related pic
  people in toronto though generally are reserved    bullshit
  i cant imagine any girl thats dtf being    any girl thats dtf you maybe people arent some weird monolith
animethon was fun actually really loved the new venue and a lot of the events they had set up fantastic gaming hall with loads of options and space too    the festival games were a neat addition but i think they should have had better prizes on the whole some of the hosts were entertaining though like the fat dude who would shake the bell around and holler and the persona 5 guy doing some kind of shoutcast of the fishing game    panels were lacking on the whole kind of boring for the most part a lot of them felt like they just shat something out for the free pass but most stuff the actual staff did was great besides the closing ceremony oh my god that was so awkward
  post con blues setting in hard
cosplay matsuri this weekend cosplaying shooting wotaing
  my friend and i thought the panels were really lack luster too i know its all dependent on what gets submitted but it was a sad selection this year i love assisting friends with panels but im not good at making then myself lol
  you just have to go and talk to a lot of people until you find someone that is single there i would say 4/10 females i talk to at animethon are single      my only advice is to not act like a total fucking weeb there and talk to a lot of females try to be interesting and not weird at the same time also let them know you want to be friends because otherwise theyll just think youre a creep for talking to them most females wont be interested but theres always a few that are once youre friends its almost a guarantee that they are down to fuck you if theyre single    last day at animethon i went back with two girls to their hotel was not a bad con at all
guys it seems to me that im late to the party but im moving to montreal in beginning of october will there be any cosplay cons or anime meetups there after these dates  how else do you think i could get to know people with similar tastes in montreal is it even possible thanks
for anyone that didnt grab a room for an crowne plaza is up again
so apparently novii is back who has been shooting with him all ive seen are statuses of people calling out the girls for not tagging him
does canada include alaska i never hear any news here
  i think the callouts are for shanyan cosplay shes been posting really noviilooking photos with fake/no photographer credits   i heard miss rushka might also be shooting with him shes posted some sus things but idk for sure whereas shanyan im pretty much certain about   fucking disgusting
anyone planning on going to ecee 
  im probably going as a booth attendant for our store not sure what to wear yet  my boss is allowing cosplay for employees
  alaska is part of the us learn some geography anon
  i mean considering i live here and have been in a lot of other areas around the us  were pretty much canada
  no were not lmao
  probably for at least saturday i really dont want to give them money but now that taste is dead local events are becoming few and far between
when does yeti con hotels open up
  we hardly get any threads its not fair
anyone going to japan festival this weekend
  i think theres mini comiccon which was like 5 pass for a little one day thing but essentially its just a big dealers room if you dont mind driving out a bit theres ganime in january but i think thats it until next spring/summer
  speaking of creeper photogs there have been more callouts floating around recently is there a masterlist of people to avoid somewhere theres so many to keep track of ugh
  never heard of it got a link
  tw bruises/domestic abuse      his ex is certified batshit insane so i wouldnt believe too much of what either one is saying but scroll down for the court papers
  vincenzos photography poynter photography to name a few  noviis back apparently    just find a photographer whos a woman and save yourself the trouble its always men who do this garbage
  when enough evidence is stacked up against them  multiple models confide in me about it    does this bitch not realize that people lie all the time
  leave your feminist propaganda out of this stacey
  the point still stands though  have you ever heard of a female photographer being a creep to their clients cause i havent
  edmonton lmao  whats wrong with edmonton
anyone cosplaying for fanexpo im gonna be there taking photos
  whats the dirt on poynter
  pretty mild stuff compared to the above but still lacking in self reflection        i think momokun has demonstrated its not just men who do creep stuff
  everything
  define everything please i live in edmonton
japan fest confirmed lit aff especially onepixcel  go today at 1pm to catch them in mississauga  
are there any cosplayers/cosplays that ppl are looking forward to seeing at fan expo this year
  i think my sister found you on tinder anonkun
  fuck off with your sexist bullshit there some of the best photographers in our community are men and those ones are usually not creepers
  being so sexist that you will avoid all men because a few are creepers    guess you may as well just not shop at a store with a guy there too or take a taxi or just simply walk down the street you fucking sexist
  if i had the option to choose then why not you have to be intentionally dense if you think theres no difference between male and female photographers
  the whole city is one big gongshow
  no difference between male and female photographers    youre right male photographers are better
  gongshow  thats not really much to go by now is it  i dont understand are people from edmonton creepy as shit
  like who exactly
  you cant be sexist towards men and its not just a few there are plenty of creepy men out there why take the risk
  the situation is different photography usually requires closed quarters and most con photographers dont have a staff so its usually just you and them that gives potential creepers plenty of opportunities to be actual creepers    are all dudes creepers ofc not but theres a garbage amount that are and you lower your risks by shooting with a female photog instead whos just there for the money and not trying to grab your tits
  you can certainly be sexist towards men but generally about restricted topics a lot of women and men dont believe men can be raped they can and are also super shitty towards trans men effeminate men gay men etc    i do get your point but lets not hastily generalize that sexism towards men cant exist  it just more generally doesnt when talking about cishetero men and mainstream masculinity
  prejudice plus power is the madeup qualifier for racism not sexism   besides even if you dont define sexual discrimination/prejudice as sexism discrimination and prejudice are just clapping emoji as clapping emoji bad clapping emoji    not that it matters because that definition isnt valid or real anyway its a bullying tactic  you absolutely can be sexist towards men you can be racist towards white people   the funny part is when the white men get bent out of shape and start crying about it as if its an argument they can win like   lmfao  these posts the photographers who arent creeps dont need your sympathy or help  youre actually making it worse
  its not really made up any more than anything else racism is pretty complicated and its common use should reflect the prejudice plus power formula because thats the genuine article that does harm
    sjws detected
  nazi detected 
  the power plus prejudice definition is an excuse made up by groups of people who want to lash out in revenge to make themselves feel better through catharsis without actually doing anything constructive to change racist peoples attitudes its a double standard created to enable righteous revenge acts a similar double standard is visible in the claim that sexism against men doesnt exist an enabler of guiltfree revenge
  then take friends with you dont go alone with the photographer if that photographer refuses then deny them
  smells like alt right in here
  the problem is that sometimes you do shoot with someone you can supposedly trust who then turns out to be a gigantic creep vincenzo is a good example friends with that dude for years then he assaults one of our friends during a photoshoot she trusted him implicitly and he betrayed that    why run the risk when its less likely a female photog will just straight up not do that and make you feel comfortable
  but there are so many good male photographers too literally bring a friend as its a real shame to skip out on some of the really good male photographers with big names at that the one you mentioned wasnt even that big
  but there are so many good male photographers too    such as
  yeah but unless i have the money to afford someone like paul hillier or tim birmingham its not worth the risk theres a ton of great female photographers out there who present no risk and do equivalent or better work so who cares it seems like youre just trying to notallmen this which smells of an ulterior motive maybe youre just a creep photographer trying to create a more tolerant space for creep photographers idk but its weird how fixated you are
  why go to all that trouble when you can just work with a female photog     you sound so assblasted about this why are you trying to tell people what photographer they should work with if you want to shoot with a male photog no one is going to stop you let people work with who they want and feel most comfortable with
  i personally dont care who you work with its just that you really start to limit your options if you cut out a whole gender of good and honest talents just cause of a few bad eggs thus why i suggest if you see a photographer who happens to be male have a good reputation and does excellent photos that you would want just bring friends to stay safe
  ulterior motive  i just am defending my male photographers i work with that have done an excellent job without being creepers    maybe youre just a creep photographer trying to create a more tolerant space for creep photographers idk but its weird how fixated you are    or maybe you are a female photographer who isnt getting anywhere near as many hits as the big male ones and want to grab as many customers as you can be telling people not to go to them even with friends around see i can do the same and no im only a cosplayer not a photographer
  see here for some examples 
    just to add to what i said i dont see a problem with working with just women if you feel more comfortable but to tell people who would normally feel comfortable working with men to not to do so is what this is all about i do however certainly hope those women who do work with men bring friends to stay safe anyways
  bring friends  as someone whos been assaulted by a photographer before even having brought friends this doesnt work some creeps are just creeps and will touch you without consent anyway then brush it off as just a joke    sorry not sorry if you touch my tits without my consent youre committing sexual assault    yes my friends came to my aid after the fact but i had already been assaulted so what was even the point i couldve shot with elemental or conmom instead and i wouldnt have had to go through any of that friends or no
  assault  you sound like a cunt and a primadonna
  a ton of great female photographers out there who present no risk   can we stop erasing victims of femaleonfemale sexual violence it absolutely does exist its even easier for the perpetrators to wave it away as just a joke or even normal behaviour between women by legitimizing their nonexistence as a valid perspective youre targeting the victims and inciting a culture of violence to continue against them you need to stop because your arguments are bordering on hateful levels if they arent already there
  lulz    okay so    1 female on female violence in the photography community is relatively unheard of it does exist but the ratio of assault by male photogs vs female is massive to the point you could say its not a problem    there is definitely evidence for it in the cosplay community but generally from other cosplayers like momokun    no one is saying theres a zero percent chance a female photog will be inappropriate but you have a waaaay lower chance of them being creepers vs male photogs
  so do you just grab peoples tits without their permission
  no one is saying theres a zero percent chance a female photog will be inappropriate  what do the words no risk mean to you   whoever made that post was willing to exaggerate to try and make their point when they say no risk they are either misinformed hateful or lyingexaggerating  either way  nobody should listen to them there are many male photographers that would not sexually assault anyone and havent can we move on now
  there are many male photographers that would not sexually assault anyone and havent    bullshit theyre all just creeps waiting to be exposed people are just too scared to come forward thats why people dont find out until its too late you never see this with female photographers therefore shoot with them or run the real risk of sexual harrassment or assault
  add mentally ill to that list as well then
  youre having a meltdown all you had to say was that youre sorry for exaggerating  yikes
  tell me one instance about female on female violence in the photography community you said it exists
  im low effort using my own gear and throwing some japari park stuff on it i dont do much cosplay if any but if i can make anything i own for practical use in to something fun i usually roll with it hoping to at least get some photos with some other people in cosplay from the same show
  the sexism in this one is truly strong i think it goes beyond sjwism to full blown feminazism at this point
  bullshit theyre all just creeps waiting to be exposed people are just too scared to come forward    im pretty sure a lot are doing it cause they are poor and just want to use their skills to make money
is it just me or was fan expos roundhouse park more dead than usual today
  no they do it so they can get closer to and be alone with girls theyre just predators in the guise of photographers
  so theyre not photographers then their pictures arent considered photographs   your arguments just keep getting worse they are bordering on making no sense whatsoever  keep explaining your hate away  its working
  to call every single male photographer a creeper is no different than men who call all women thots    its sexist there and its sexist here too
  im pretty sure a lot are doing it cause they are poor and just want to use their skills to make money    blasphemer how dare you bring logic to 4chan
  everyone you disagree with is just an sjw nazi got it
  i never said everyone unlike you
  is this even a real post or just someone with really poor reading comprehension
    fellow edmonton cosplayer can confirm  self included city and cosplayers in it
  will be in attendance only acceptable con left in edmonton since ive grown out of anime
    all men are predators    get yourself checked into a mental asylum
kimikon seems like its gonna be the next big con are you going/thoughts on the con im pretty skeptical
  i simply wanna know more about this con all i see is these cosplay guests none of which i ever care about as i only care for ones like voice actors and such but i havent a single thing about panels exhibitors dealers etc    otherwise its super easy to lobby just outside of the con considering it is right where the cne normally is
  skeptical about this con there doesnt seem to be enough on the content for a 3 day con ill pass on it first year and see how it is before i spend anything on it    theres a schedule up and for the most part theres 1 possible thing to do at any time some exceptions really seems like they could have done this as a 1 day con with the amount of content i see
    it really doesnt look good for them im sad because id love to see a good fall con but it just seems too ambitious for a 1rst year con that and not a lot of people are talking about it
  same situation i did check out animethon but it was mostly a reality check for me im just not into anime any more hyped for expo even if its not a super big con or anything
  i sincerely hope whoever is bankrolling it doesnt run out of money during the con as has happened to some trainwreck first year cons    im seeing some different groups of kids starting to collaborate with the con for cosplay events and panels and i really hope they dont get screwed by the con
  not gonna waste my time desu it doesnt offer anything you cant get somewhere else like an or bravo or fx and its really expensive for a first year
  lookin like unplugged 20 which at one point i saw being nicknamed photoshoot con  not a good thing to be known for   thats the only reason i can even conceive of going to take pictures   unfortunately i almost guarantee most of the cosplayers of the few that go will likely be the youngest people in the community think the people that go to events like anime shogatsu and the cosplay picnics as compared to the varied crowd you see that is sourced from all over ontario at fan ex or an     its also 1 week before eglx  which actually has improved a lot over the years     i would not be surprised if the person who made this post works for kimikon considering ive seen this post happen at least 3 times already in the /cgl/ canada threads over the summer   kimikon seems like its gonna be the next big con  lol maybe desperate promoters actually believe their own lies    this isnt a quirky lil forest city comiccon thats serving an under represented market literally hours away from the gta its a late comer to an already crowded and exhausted bubble thats arguably already popped hopefully im wrong for kimikons sake and everything turns out fantastic for them
  lolnope
why cant new cons pop up in ottawa we have shitty normie comiccon and some small geek fears related to comic books and super heros
so this is the girl won kimikosplay kontest wtf that looks nothing like the mascot    also people on the inside said they were giving free passes to pretty cosplayers under the guise of random draws
  thats a closest cosplay if ive ever seen one      lookin like unplugged 20 which at one point    okay to be fair unplugged actually had some things going for it it got decent guests for some time from the sailor moon cast to jyb had some more interesting panels and nowhere near as pricey all i see with kimikon is just cosplay guest after cosplay guest and sakimichan which sadly is looking like the best thing about the con an artist being the best thing about the con is how sad this gets    if this con was 1 day at even 30 bucks i think it could look better for a first year
    this con definitely seems too ambitious for its first year i dont necessarily want to see it fail but im a bit hard pressed to see how it can succeed
  nah dont work for kimikon and am definitely not promoting it the reason i asked in the first place is because there seems to be hardly any information about it and ive seen a lot of skeptical people and by big con i mean being in a big city and being in a big convention centre not like a local comicon
  i signed up for kimikon artist alley earlier in the year but as it gets closer to the date im totally regretting it i signed up before that shady an stuff went down and the closer we lead up to the con theres no freaking promotion about it at all im thinking of asking for a refund but im getting the feeling it wont be easy
  im sorry that happened anon it is very weird seeing no promotion about it at all im not sure ive heard about what happened with them at anime north but messing up at a big con like that seems like a big mistake
  mostly cuz the ottawa comiccon runners monopolize the ottawa convention centre with their contract it was the whole reason pop expo existed for awhile to make sure ottawa geek market couldnt run in that space    sadly theres not a lot of other venues and with the occ people being shitty its difficult to get traction
  what was the shady an stuff anon i only heard of kimikon cause of sakimichans instagram promoting it but that was months ago and i think it was only one or two post im surprised shes not promoting it more desu im probably going to go since location works well for me there was a couple cosplayers and photographers who said they were going when i spoke to people at fan expo but only a handful of ppl
  kimikons booth got kicked out of dealers at an because they broke the rule of not selling fanart in the dealers
all the cool fan expo shit isnt coming to vancouver   youve got to be fucking me
  get fucked china jr
edmonton expo tomorrow see you guys there going just to cosplay and maybe find some comics im missing in my collections    disappointed with the celebs and even the comic guests this year but all the more reason to not drop some cash
should i go to fan expo vancouver if i only like anime and not comic shit
  i went once a few years ago and it was overwhelmingly comic book stuff if thats not your thing then dont go not sure if its changed at all over the years
  please dont weebs ruin comic book conventions stay in your own lane
  its okay we can let all the shitty comic book nerds ruin their own conventions
  i can triggered when i see comic/video game characters at anime cons
  oh please yet weeb cosplayers go to comic conventions and claim  waaahhh but its a pop culture convention
          maybe were all just giant nerds who dont need to be shitty to each other
this thread really became dead since nekko stopped posting here what happened
  theres no big upcoming cons to look forward to so no discussion is happening
seems like unplugged is coming back for oct 2019 i mean i would love an oct con but jabent had the best experience with unplugged
i want to fuck a cute canadian weaboo/geek boy
hey i was just at ottawa geek market and someone handed me a flier to a con happening next week that i had never heard of it looks hilariously bad i may go just to see the shitshow n2uca
  ssooo fuck means
  have sex with
  are you a cute girl from vancouver
  yes lets meet up 
  its actually an old con that already failed twice the moron trying to run it keeps trying to bring it back despite it being a complete shit show every time
  youre going to get sexually assaulted
  meet me at bcit this saturday
        nekko talking to himself
  come to guilford mall      anyone gonna go to the parade anything worth checking out in that area
  remember the whole theres ecstacy in the water jugs we need to shut the con down thing from a few years ago
  from like 2011 more than a few but yeah its always a fucking shitshow naru needs to stop
  i wonder how many people are even going id be surprised if their attendance hits 200
is anyone else going to the au boudoir dalice halloween tea party
wtf is even there to do in waterloo
  lolita meets
  isnt that a femaleonly thing
  hello fellow sounthern ontarian
  hey dude
  it hit a whole honking 50    no im not missing a zero fifty five times ten    and he wants to run it next year yikes
  is this counting the staff dealers etc    because that is really bad even for a firstyear con
hi all im a little new to the gta cosplay scene and am wondering what photogs are good ive heard stories about so many creeps that im sort of freaked out and want to get some opinions
  
  at this time there are about 45 cosplay photographers in the gta montreal ottawa and niagara always avoid these ones     tomeverage studios photography   marcopoynter photography   noviino facebook or instagram   burditt photography
    mentioned twice and hasnt replied  has he finally given up on cgl and cosplay
  ohh what are the general warnings with those guys im afraid i dont know a lot about drama thats gone on in the past
  looks like a new con coming to toronto
  its anirevo coming to east coast also called fatescon by some due to the guest list this year
nmft was a fun night it went too long for me and i got paranoid about missing buses and then the last train so i completely skipped out on ululu otori was the most interesting band elephant gym was the best of the night sad i didnt get any elephant gym merch
  yes he gave up and moved to japan where he is going to spend the rest of his life with his memetan
  general warnings with those guys  everage studios photography  thing for feet and young girls  poynter photography  also feet and uses his aspergers as to say his behavior is normal has release an apology for his behavior a number of months ago  novii asking for sexual favors during a shoot  burditt photography reports of him making commits of a girlfriend scale really thirsty for a cosplay girlfriend
      basically just dont have a man as your photographer they will creep on you  just book with female photogs and youre good
  hate to say it but i probably will stick to that like i said ive only shot a little but the female photogs were a million times better than the guys i loved working with alex rose for example     any recommendations you might have for female photographers other than her and con mom
  drama/community vendettas are against the rules on this board please take your hateful prejudice bias elsewhere
  vendetta
    its not a changing room but these toilets are usually free and enormous at the otakuthon    basically once you take the escalators to go from the cosplay area to where the panels are go left there will be stairs leading to an area just below it    there theres a massive toilet lots of stalls shitloads of mirrors and barely ever anyone there     best place to change at the otakuthon
  0/10 use of the meme desu the word vendetta only appears twice in this topic the other time having nothing to do with this conversation     at least someone has a vendetta against all male photographers the person in this post   both linked write in a way that puts emphasis using all caps on words they deem important probably the same person       a prolonged bitter quarrel with or campaign against someone    that was on august 31st and this type of hate is still being spewed seems like a prolonged bitter campaign to me
  you may call it hateful prejudice but its perfectly sound   every creep photographer that has been exposed is a man logically you would avoid male photographers because they will creep on you it just makes sense  meanwhile no female photographers have been outed as creeps are there creepy female photographers sure but we dont know any and even if we did their numbers would never match the male ones
  lol what is this logic this is the same type of arguments that brainlet trump supporters use to explain how black people are more likely to be criminals and other flawed racist viewpoints if this post isnt just an elaborate troll you should really be ashamed of yourself
  im not really denying that theres more chance of something being fishy with a male photog i just dont appreciate delusional all male photogs will sexually assault you rhetoric
  its not delusional if its true
  nigel murray photography is a super chill dude and ive worked with him many times i def recommend him hes just starting out too and from what i know actually has an education in photography so he knows what hes doing
did anyone go to fan expo vancouver today
  i loved working with alex rose for example  i heard return time of her images can take months  i loved hearing all the shit talk about her from female photographers and cosplayers          you need to get laid  himtoo      i have to agree the work isnt bad
  the keyword here being if  go get some therapy if you have such a chip on your shoulder dont crusade against entirely innocent group of men for months anonymously on 4chan  weirdo
  a lesbian friend of mine dragged me to one a few years back it was shit half the more famous vas there didnt show up
whos going to upcoming stuff in toronto kimicon eglx etc
can we finally get the toronto fan expo guys to do the vancouver one too they always get the good stuff while we get nothing
  toronto  good    yeah its good for 5 hour lines and heatstroke
  hey its good if youre a normie collecting autographs for your favorite netflix/comic book ip and its indoors with decent ac different strokes for different folks i do have to admit this year fan expo upped their anime game a lot
  thats fair they do have a lot of famous people for normies and nonnormies alike and a lot less oddities unlike smaller cons
  men  innocent    creeps are not innocent
  him too is not a thing men dont get sexually assaulted as much as women do and the ones that supposedly are take away attention from who truly deserve it namely the women
  i heard return time of her images can take months    true but shes so nice and made me feel so comfortable compared to only having shot with male photographers before that that i dont mind
  men dont get sexually assaulted as much as women do  but you admitted they do so its a thing
  youre being really damn creepy right now desu got something to hide
remember when creepanon the manhater was goaded into posting racist stuff against black people and assumingly temp banned      we should honestly just ignore everything they write why continue to give a platform to an angry white supremacist brainlet
kimikon schedule is starting to look less threadbare than before anyone else going on saturday
  nah that was me and it was the first time i posted in this thread wasnt even racist if you even bothered to read the post properly it got taken down but i didnt get banned or even warned
  what can you repeat yourself please i cant hear you from all the way up there on that mountain
  makes wrong assumptions   posts memes when corrected  lol okay not everyone is trying to stroke their ego boner here go elsewhere if you wanna continue your offtopic circlejerk because i doubt most anons care if you wanna whitenight male photogs
  dude weed
  not in waterloo but theres an upcoming comiccon in london though forest city comicon is alot better but it was like last month sorry if london onatrio is too far though my brother has a girlfriend in waterloo so im just assuming its kinda close by
anyone going to kimikon
  sorry  dont be anon  london is like 2 hours away not like i could pull away from work to do anything before xmas anyways
  friday and saturday to revel in idol hell
  nope i only know of 1 artist going seems like most of us are waiting fir shit to hit the fan this weekend
  i was originally in aa but dropped out bc i wasnt sure i was going to make my money back im going friday to scope it out though
    i wonder if theyre still tables available i might come the day of and if there seems to be a crowd try to see if theyre offering discounted prices for the leftover tables im local anyway
  its an hour and 15 minutesunless youre taking greyhound in which case my condolences the train isnt too bad but fucking expensive imo     i find forest city to be better than london comicon as well the venue and atmosphere were certainly nicer but it was a little dead this year and some of the masquerade prizes were kinda meh i still wouldnt bother with london comicon tho at least fccc is downtown so you can bail and go to the museum or the couple nice ramen and/or sushi restaurants we have lcc is eoa aka in the fucking ghetto at a fairgrounds thats also surrounded by missions and soup kitchens with only a smattering of nice stores if you feel like walking six blocks or an overpriced indoor adventure park going the other direction no thanks
  unless youre taking greyhound  i have to im doing a phd in waterloo and my car is in bc  not really into western comic cons but ill keep an eye on fccc thanks anon
    lets us know how bad friday turns out
  actual i decided to become memetan
  wait which one is which here
  im mirin bro what are your stats
  id guess theyre usually dead hopefully tomorrow picks up a bit
  i only got there late so didnt see how it was in the day when i got there the artist alley looked real slow    for the idol performances the seats were only a third full but the audience was lit as fuck thanks to the wota brigade in attendance     the game section was actually pretty big and well stocked for a small con
  25/185cm/virgin
  for the idol performances the seats were only a third full but the audience was lit as fuck thanks to the wota brigade in attendance     i was speaking with the volunteer that gave me a weekend pass she was told to cheer the people on stage     kimikon was ok at best not worth the price tag
  so i only went one day but i heard that one of my artist friends wanted to drop out of aa and they gave them 50 off their table to make them stay they were desperate for people
  wew lad send spread glutes
anyone going eglx know how lobby con friendly it is
  i plan to go saturday   eglx back in march wasnt to friendly
  is it not like march comicon where they have an area inside the building before the actual con entry
how good is dtac usually ive never been and currently craving a cosplay event
  dtac has gotten better over the last few years its also great to lobby and hangout
has anyone checked this out        they were passing out a coupon code for it at youmacon in detroit but it seems odd that a con in 5 months doesnt have any ticket information up yet
  i have heard of this con i do agree that it is strange they had an event in japan this year its said to be run by the folks doing anime rev
  i dont know much about that area in toronto but the con rates for the hotel seem pretty insane as well
  i thought the mtcc had some sort of exclusivity deal with fanexpo/dtac its a prime location for a big con but neither anime north or kimikon were held there but were held in similarly sized buildings fanexpo  dtac are the only two cons held at mtcc its weird that a first year con not associated with the two is being held there
  doubt theyve got exclusivity eglx was at mtcc just a few weeks ago its likely just expensive this company likely assumes that even with a potential loss in the first years that having it in a real location is their best chance to suceed in the long term its hard to imagine it picking up steam when its sandwiched inbetween mtac and anime north but good luck to them
  oh i wasnt aware of that thats a very risky move to make regardless holding new and unknown conventions in expensive venues a la kimikon often doesnt go well and being in between mtac and anime north makes it worse     i also didnt see them advertising at mtac anime north or fanexpo i feel like advertising at youmacon wouldnt do much because i doubt too many people would drive from detroit to toronto for a first year con     im glad that more people are trying to run cons in ontario but i wish that they would start smaller and grow each year instead of trying to be the next anime north right away
  are you the guy infamous poster from /v/ 
i thought ar usually posts what date the next years con is right after the end of the current one but they still havent posted anything for 2019
anyone have thoughts on kawaii land worth checking out
  xgouki cosplay is gonna be a guest there so im gonna go its free admission too
  xgouki cosplay is gonna be a guest there  was looking for a reason not to go
  is there drama around xgouki she seems pretty cool and i like her cosplays
i think i attended 3 cons roughly 10 years ago i havent been in a long time anime north just seems to get overwhelmingly big its pretty intimidating i dont have friends to go with nor do i know how to make friends at these things how would an isolated canadian anime fan in ontario progress into forming social bonds with other anime fans how do you deal with scary things like people who might hate you or persecute you for liking certain genres
  dtac is small and is also cheap to enter lobby it if you most still a good number of weebs
  drama on her facebook didnt like her friends advice
  persecute you for liking certain genres  is this an euphemistic way of saying that youre a lolicon
  continues cosplaying despite rent issues and shamelessly made a gofundme for her bad spending habits
      her  she    remember when he first posted on cgl in a trap thread and got so butt hurt over people giving him honest critique over his shitty as make up
  its free so im going for the music guests like the theremin player
  well she states pretty clearly on all her sm that shes trans and her pronouns so im gonna go with she  her
  but they literally only ever cosplay samus
so the canada post strike has officially gone beyond fucking us        no airmail sal or ems shipping from japan to canada
  keeps redoing samus and spending thousands on things like a wig that partially made of real human hair but then doesnt know how to maintain it
  holy shit how is her samus wig thousands of dollars
  hero hair
dream cosplays youve always wanted to do but havent due to time money obscurity    pictured goemon a silent game icon gem that died out in the states
i want to cosplay peridot/zenyatta crossover with dumb cans instead of metal orbs
my dream cosplay would be a jojo character with a mannequin of their stand strapped to my back    im not at that level yet though
  ah i didnt finish the message    the other one is lemeza from la mulana in that pic but i know people would just say its indiana jones and i would get upset
  holy shit its goemon    id be ridiculously hype to see this at a con i think the only thing is that the hair is the most recognizable feature which would be hard to get right
my dream cosplay might be making some sort of gundam cosplay but im in no particular position to tackle such a huge project at this time along with being backlogged with other cosplays
  please do it
tfw no fai to make you relevant or recognizable  
any shirtless character with a ripped body i guess
  fai is my dream cosplay anon
  due to obscurity  seriously just make it even if its obscure someone will recognize it particularly if you wear it at a big con even if nobody does at least youll have the satisfaction of knowing that you made a cosplay from something that you love
    bam do it    mine is bayonetta i will never be 2/3 leg enough  also any characters with pants because my thighs are big
  its possible to pull bayo off even with average leg length ive even seen cosplayers with short legs be able to pull her off by wearing really high heels to give the illusion of legs for days
  wya anon
id really like to cosplay shep since i love interstella 5555 so much but his suit is too complex for me and i dont think i555 is really all that recognizable outside of the daft punk fandom
  ive wanted to do stella but havent because body paint is hell and i wouldnt be comfy walking around a con in her crotch cutout dress ive thought of doing her award show outfit or maybe compromising and doing the white version from the shep dream scene but i dont think id be recognized and it does kind of suck when people have no idea what youre doing
hana from collar x malice i havent done it yet because it looks like a daunting amount of work but i actually started looking at fabric yesterday
any kind of mecha im newer to cosplay and only good at making masks so far but id love to do a megazord zoid or a medabot
i need to sit down and actually watch the show/read the manga but the sugar sugar rune witch designs i love and want to cosplay one day its a really great blend of retro and mid 2000s but really simple making giant witch hats looks like alot of fun
the day i could figure out how to construct and wear laughing octopus helmet without breaking my neck will be a glorious day
  boston god id literally kill to do them
  ahhh its so great to see someone doing her i always loved her design and that game in general is so good
i know its probably a bit played out by now but i still want to put together a dredd or well a 2012 judge with my last name cosplay as some point  i think itd be fun to hunt down and put together all the component parts and do weathering and shit heck i might try doing some parts out of eva foam for practice
full dragon deathwing because im tired of all the humanoid versions stilts leds smoke puppetry in the tail head and wings    just never started it because i do not have the space and facilities to create it
  this one big time would also want to do a proper imperial guard or inquisitor costume the former is pretty doable and i should honestly just start be experimenting with material    would also love to do joseph jostar but   510    and if youre thinking of doing a gfg costume please do i believe in you
  being 100 authentic is incredibly expensive on this one not to mention id need to learn how to sew the jacket
would love to do ulala one day but im not tall and and i tend to dress really modestly so id be kind of uncomfortable wearing this
akane from magic users club but id want a sae and nanaka    also no one else watched this damn show and i know people would be asking what character from little witch i was
for few years ive been wanting to do a pepe hoodie and then carry around a notebook where you could share your feels like that one girl in durarara having a book write something you miss etc    really low effort one but i drop my spaghetti easily so i havent done it yet but im gonna do it in the future
saber prototype for me    freeflowing fabrics are spooky for me and i really really hate topstitching    i also have 0 experience with foam
  of course
wanna just let er rip once man 
aisha clanclan but ill never be that muscular    also subaru or aura from hack//sign theres no way to do girl floating above a bed at a con
i like my costumes to be fully functional and realistic how do i make a fully functional astronaut suit
i have no clue where id start with this and itll probably be out of my budget for a while one day ill represent best boy
ill never be willowy enough again and those wings
  
gunna purge me some heretics one day
  anon are you me
main reason is that i have boobs and also am not sticc if i had more time/money i would probably attempt to do one of those fake chests though i think adekan has some really nice outfits
  id love to do a sister of battle cosplay some day one of the nice things about 40k cosplay is that i dont feel bad about putting off a character for a few years because theres no   what if im not young and cute enough for that character anymore anxiety    youre 80 years old scarred up that only makes you look more authentic
alphonse would be awesome
full armor varia suit samus  i have no experience with foam or armor in general
from left too obscure too obscure too obscure and ive accepted that im never gonna have the body of a teenager again
  i vaguely remember 2nd from left reboot or some show like that
  yup i loved it as a kid but its just not that recognizable plus the extent to which id have to tan my skin orange to look right for her borders on racebending
  see thats a cool concept and all but a lot of people cosplay for the attention and the chance to get to talk to other fans reducing that to maybe one or two people per con if youre lucky isnt an option just depending on your priorities
  please do this  i personally want to cosplay yae so i understand the apprehension
my hips and thighs are wayyy too wide to cosplay my dream raziel in either his vampire or ethereal form    an actual doable one for me is sally whitemane but id have to save up a bunch of money a gender bend of sinichi with migi could be fun too       oh anon i love the btb unit designs laughing octopus is awesome i just feel like i would be super uncomfortable in tight latex due to my stomach issues gl to you though anon
  first one  we need more ace attorney cosplays that arent just main characters or proscecutors
i have a lot that i would love to do but i think the ones at the top of the list are mostly monster hunter my goal is to do the mosgharl armor eventually but i have pretty much no experience with armor making asode from that id love to cosplay waka but im still pretty novice with sewing so ill have to get a lot more practice before trying to make his outfit    anon i would love to see a dahlia i wish there were more aa cosplayers that werent godot or phoenix
always thought this was one of the coolest armour designs ive never played the game and only met a couple who have id want to go all out or nothing at all though
welsh dragon boosted gear scale mail with juggernaut drive transforming actionbut a recent horror game has given me a fear of springs in suits and thats a big part of how it would transform
  theres literally nothing wrong with doing obscure cosplays if you wear it to a bigger con theres pretty much guaranteed to be one or two people who will recognize it
  not that anon but i dont think anyone here thinks its wrong to do an obscure cosplay they just dont want to do one personally myself i just put into too much effort and time in making cosplays to only have a couple of folks recognize it call me an attention slut if you will but id rather go with something more people now
  to clarify i dont think theres anything wrong with doing obscure cosplays obscure cosplays are almost all i do and the only cons i go to are sdcc fanime and ax so i think i know about large cons but thanks for assuming for these costumes its just not worth it to put in the effort it would take when i could be having fun cosplaying relevant stuff that people will recognize and geek out with me about         the main reason ive rejected this one is ive never been able to find anyone to cosplay with and i dont think shes recognizable enough on her own if i had a phoenix id be all over it
  i would also love to do joseph joestar but  dyel  maybe if i really start getting in shape i could pull off joseph as araki draws him now but as of now im in no shape to cosplay someone in a cropped tank top
          just wanted to say that i love you all excellent choices and lovely characters  go and do your dream cosplays anons
  this shizz will cost me 4 figures but ill be damned if i dont do a couple one with my gf next year my face actually resembles him so its a no brainer really
but no one would have any idea who the hell i am
id like to do eileen the crow but making a cowl out of black feathers would take forever
  im in philly area    what cons do you go to
  ive got a tsubasa sakura cosplay that ive wanted to pair up with someone cosplaying this anon just photoshop your wings in prostyle
  youve chosen a dangerous man to deal with witcher
adam jensen is one of my favorite vidya characters but his look is so complex that literally every aspect of it is miles outside my skill level
elite riot gear goddamn i love this outfit but its so complicated and also i would pass out from the heat wearing a leather duster over that armor
with all my heart i want to do her but every time i buy the fabric i back down because of the armor    also want to do shantae aisha klan klan and mimi from digimon but im phasing out cons and dont have time to do as many cosplays and already have my summer ones planed for next june   like mimi is possible as a lazy day costume others not so much
the outfit seems easy enough but her hair is some rose quartz level difficulty i have no clue how to make roses at the ends of hair and would be scared to death of making the wig look all crusty nyanperona is another distant dream but i dont have nearly enough experience to create a full mascot suit
  dahlia isnt obscure at all
my stomach is all kinds of fucked up from having a kid i dont think ill ever feel confident enough to cosplay anything that shows my stomach even though i really want to cosplay one of the bear forms of lulu or ginko from yuri kuma arashi maybe some day when i get back into shape i can tighten up my stomach enough and cover the stretch marks but i really dont think itll look good even then and i may still have loose skin no matter how many sit ups i do
  you could just make a fabric bodice thats skin colored people do it often
  also on the same note of obscurity id love to cosplay reia with my daughter as younger kureha but i feel like most likely it would be one of those cosplays thats kind of hard to recognize    do you think that would help mask loose skin ill have to look into it thanks anon i dont know why that didnt really occur to me
  god i would love to see a marina someday i cant do armor or id have attempted it myself
  not on its own you need to wear a body shaper under it like spanx to hold the skin tight
  ab and katsu hopfully colossal east or ota next year
  the ones ive seen to inspire me are so sad the skirt seems and shoulders are always bad i mean sure i could do her 100 gold gems costume change but its not the same i just wanna go around a con yelling shake shake with one of those caniballs
id love to cosplay someone from sinoalice but im probably one of like 5 people in my country that knows what it is
  guts specifically during the lost children arc too much time and money which i have hardly either
  four years ago i wanted to do the vanguard armor from runescape  now recently i want to do the gravewardens armor from world of warcraft
  which varia suit
one day my burly friend one day
im still going to do it eventually but ill be very surprised if anyone recognizes me this game holds a very special place in my heart i plan on having a red bird plush inside the cage too
  fuck id kill to see more rule of rose stuff this game needs more love or a rerelease sad the old blog with all the deep dive lore went down   i gave my younger brother my copy and he sold it i still havent forgiven him over it
aigis from p3 dont have the funds or time to make the body suit or the weird pieces for her joints also i have no clue how to make the legs
i dont have enough experience with styling extreme wigs and i dont want to make them look bad
travis because hes not really relevant anymorrrrre  pd would be fun but i am terrified of body paint  i would probably look like a threat as hunk out in public  aaaand that ancient armor set is just uhhh very glowy i dont have the skill for it and by the time i do itll be too late
im not sure if anyone would recognize me but the main thing is im not sure how id go about doing things like the staff and all those ruffles
  maybe not that costume specifically but anything with mitsukis drill hair and plushies for meroko and tokuto would be pretty recognizable
  what was the name of the blog anon
  travis because hes not really relevant anymorrrrre  theres a new nmh spinoff game coming out in january so theres your relevance plus i cosplayed him earlier this year and got a bunch of positive reactions
  yeah hes totally a distinctive character that people remember
i would love to do this as a couples cosplay but  no gf
  maybe you could find a gf by dressing up as the guy anyway and running into someone who recognises you or is dressed as the chick dont give up hope jsut do your thing and see where it goes
  anon i would kill for this game to have a rerelease it was a personal tragedy when rule of rose mysteries went down you can still use the wayback machine but its just not the same its unbelievable how much a used copy goes for now
anyone from puyo puyo the orange juice games suguri qp etc while touhou cosplays make me a bit happy i would love to see people dare and try lenen characters
i want to cosplay tomoe shinohara   but if anyone called me kyary it would just annoy me
  as a disney prince cosplayer myself you would be surprised how much attention you would get
someday ten year old me someday
gashadokuro from kakuranger i dont even know how to begin making a suit like this those tight lipped fucks at toei dont ever give even a peek at their fabrication processes
i dont have the skills time or money for this but its still on my dream cosplay bucket list one day i wont cheap out and forget the under armor either i gotta go big or go home
amulet spade from shugo chara shugo chara was my favorite anime was my favorite anime when i was younger and i loved amulet spades design sadly i dont have the money to drop on an expensive premade cosplay nor do i have the skills to make it myself hopefully in the future ill have the skills to make it and fulfill my dream cosplay
  vermillion from aura kingdom     honestly she fits me so well i look fantastic with red hair and my body type fits hers ive wanted to cosplay her for years but i still havent i always go to cons alone now so cosplaying something unpopular would just make me feel worse
my absolute dream arbiter halo
im a 52 petite girl  and im never doing a genderbent version
  same and join me in my croc hat snake cosplay dreams
  hello fellow ak anon you give me hope that if i ever cosplayed uzuriel or zephyrine that someone would know who i was
  anon i think there are pepakura files for this on the rpf if you want them
i always thought sheogorath from the elder scrolls series would be a fun one to do either as in oblivion or skyrim     my skills are currently lacking though and i feel that hes too obscure
  not finding similarlysized women to genderbend the whole cast  just send it
  the feeling is mutual anon
part obscurity part thinking that im about a decade too young to pull it off
  mara from shin megami tensei    i dont know where to start
the black hand heavy weapon trooper from command and conquer renegade id want to put sooo much detail into it
  we all love mara but dude really the con would kick you out before you even stepped inside      would love to see but would still probably need you to tell me where its from unless you had one of the kids/sidekicks with you or the baby gun thing real sad this movie didnt take off cause it was good
  i only watched a single episode of it but i completely agree with you on the designs it looks like the type of mahou shoujo that i would adore but i havent sat down to actually watch it either i hope you accomplish it itd blow my mind to find a cosplayer opposite to me from that series i believe in you
  pool noodles with a fabric sleeve and eva foam maybe with a deep back harness perhaps
  i tend to dress really modestly so id be kind of uncomfortable wearing this  hard same anon ive always wanted to do birdy but i still feel uncomfortable wearing spaghetti straps or shorts above my mid thigh in public sometimes i doubt nude mesh would ever have the same effect a girl can dream though
  i have zero experience sewing outside of foam shapes that you use in kindergarten but over the weekend my boyfriend and i worked on a gauntlet together for his halloween costume and i gotta say its easier that you think start with small projects and really dedicate yourself to receiving criticism for your work and samus will become a very really possibility i believe in you
  maybe you could paint a bodysuit to achieve that faux tiny hip look i think itd work better irl than youd imagine
  holy shit i cosplayed marina in like 2012 it was so long ago and i was so bad at cosplay but she was incredibly fun to wear while i had her w seems the ship has sailed for your interest anon but in this day of lets heat some worbla over a female mannequin torso its a lot less scary than it looks her peg legs are actually the hardest part of the outfit i found    id love to cosplay warp pic related but topless  giant hole in the chest is not an easy or cheap practical effect to pull off cleanly if i can figure out a consistent effective and fairly cost efficient way of doing the effect then id probably move forward with the outfit
  this i see it less as a please fawn over me and more of a please acknowledge the love effort dedication and craftsmanship that went into this its hard enough to get that as it is with popular cosplays and before someone screams enter a competition then i and most people who feel this same sentiment arent at that level yet theres something to appreciate in all levels of craftsmanship  even beginners
  oh but thats a gorgeous design at the very least youd have people in awe of your aesthetic
  itd be worth it anon  give yourself a long time to accomplish it and i think youll find it a rewarding labor of love
  would be scared to death of making the wig look all crusty   got2b freeze spray is your god anon    id be more scared of the weight than the curls desu
  commission someone to make it
  arm socks for pd my dude you wont be able to escape painting your face and neck but itll take care of the other parts
  oh itd definitely be recognizable ive never read that manga but ive seen it in every bookstore and shoujo beat mag since i was born
  dont miss out on those black friday sales it wont completely blow you out of the water with the reductions but it might bring down the price to a point where you can feasibly tackle it i love shugo chara too ive been mulling around the idea of doing amu so i want to see you succeed
  absolutely not obscure i think youd be the belle of the ball if you would actually whip this out ya gotta do it man
goemon  as in mystical ninja damn i loved that game on the n64 it would be real awesome to see a cosplay of him    ive wanted to do muffet ever since i saw her design shes so damn cute but  the idea of doing the body paint plus multiple eyes and sewing multiple arms holding teapots combo makes me want to die
  i know the feeling
  you could always mesh shirt and have two monitors hooked up its complicated but tech is getting cheaper and cheaper every year
anette from rune factory frontier
bui from yu yu hakusho  ive got the height and shit for it but i cant into armor and itd end up looking shitty  i could do an unarmored version but people might not get who its supposed to be
ffta white mage viera ffta was one of my absolute favorite games as a kid i replayed it so so many times and would have fun with viera runs i doubt ill ever end up doing it though because of the outfit and how picky i am with details being pale af when viera dont look right super pale and i feel like ive never seen viera ears look good  they always look absolutely awful and costumey
  if anybody asks its a pickle rick costume
  i assumed you havent played revenant wings but a branch race of pale vieras do exist use that as justification
id love to do either a soundwave from transformers and sam from totally spies
the expense and level of craftsmanship required keeps me from ever starting on this but maybe one day
    in an ideal world i would make a chamber costume    but that is a fuckton of work for a costume that is going to take up so much space when im not wearing it seriously how do you even store something like that and for a robot from a 5 year old anime that was never especially popular     and even if i did decide to do it i probably wouldnt get it right
  i make big foam sets of armor and the key is to make the pieces break down enough to be able to be piled into something like pic related probably two of them for something like chamber just toss a couple of dryer sheets in the bottom to keep anything from getting funky smelling and carefully put the stuff in so nothing is bent and going to get warped and there you go i like the wheeled ones because theyre also handy for the actual transporting to cons
    followup question then i guess how do people transport big bulky costumes to cons     i have a set of knight armor that i took to a con just a few hours away and it took three big cardboard boxes to transport most of the time i go to local cons so i can just uber there and wear most of my costume for the ride but how the hell do people take big costumes long distances like to conventions that require a plane ride     i have trouble imagining people putting their delicate handmade costume pieces in checked luggage
  i thought this was a dumpster ngl
  another karneval fan  bless
one of these days
beato 100
   beato  i support you endless nine
  ughh i feel you so much i want to do amulet heart or amulet devil i would run to you if i ever saw an amu cosplayer nowadays
  always wanted to do yae but the neon green wig is hard to make look good with anything
absolutely everything about this is completely out of my skill range and price range the jacket really doesnt work as canvas it needs to be leather or faux leather at least the wig would be a lace front gravity defying beast i have some of the skills for translucent glowing props but id have to use a makerspace and the machine time adds up in price quickly     its still my eternal pipe dream though
  ive always wished i could cosplay a genis to someones lloyd im 58 with size d boobs eternal sadness
i would love to do 9s but im tall with a chubby face that would look bad with his hairstyle i wonder how bad it would be to make the wig frame my facehaha
  i have yet to see a perfect 9s go for it buy the costume and a prestyled wig and just do it
  you know this could be done fairly reasonably with either appliqué just attaching the colours shapes with white satinstitching or fabric paint if you want it to be authentic kimonos are pretty straightforward to make its mostly just squares
obscure no friends to cosplay it with me cant do it too i get my body acne into control which will be never
i dont even know how i could do it
  ive always wanted to do a full armor cosplay gundam power ranger kamen rider sentaietc im more of a prop guy and armor is hard for me to work with due to me being over weight i did a joke gundam cosplay one year where i made a shitty mask and v emblem and made a cardboard box with the word gundam on it
  i did warps other outfit the green vest white suit thing and it was comfy as hell and while not a lot of people recognized it the ones who did lost their mind over it
  if you look up her cosplays in google youll find a lot of people did her human version  you could also wear a blue zentai under the dress wich would solve the problem of the full body paint and crotch cutout dress
  tfw always wanted to cosplay colette  54 g cups brown skinned  we should start a support group
  ill join you in your sadness  always wanted to do the elementalist but im pale as fuck and dont have enough confidence for such a skimpy outfit    tfw used to be fat and unable to do skimpy outfits  tfw lost all the excess weight but now im even more insecure about my body
  the positive thing about this one is that youre never too old to cosplay batman
  duplicate file exists  wait wut    you too my beautiful bearbaby  got an instagram id love to follow along when you get to it
  these would be fantastic        more toku cosplays all around i get so excited whenever i see them
  youd have to nail the wig real well but id probably recognize you maybe make the golden record as a prop for with it
maybe once i stop being a broke lazy fuck who sucks at sewing
  if you papercrafted it im sure itd be amazing
basically i have a bunch of couple cosplays but my gf doesnt cosplay because shes better than us and im too curvy/chesty to crossplay anymore      you are a man of culture i see id love to do sam too but im wayy too curvy for that shit
  by curvy you mean fat
  do a google search for zentai  pic related comes up
  avacyn  i too want to cosplay avacyn one day anon though i wanna do her shadows over innistrad version purifier avacyn  if you wanna cosplay her i recommend doing it at a tabletop convention or at a pax if you can
  trust me he is not too obscure make a wabbajack to go with it talk about cheese all day and all the tes fans will come running
doubt anyone would recognize from what game it would be from i wouldnt care though if i could i would
  so many buff manly men that i just cant pull off as a gal for one thats not too bulky but ive still avoided for years for that reason folken of escaflowne
  a bunch of us old farts watched mahou tsukai tai it was cosplayed like 15 years ago somewhat regularly i saw it at a few cons for sure
  if you wanna believe that
ive always wanted to do a cosplay of clare from claymore but im a short black girl and idk how that would work out lololol
  escaflowne  nice taste anon ive been meaning to do hitomi or dilandau for years now
wanted to cosplay him ever since he came out but ive always felt weird about trying to cosplay a black character as a white guy    spoilerive also never cosplayed before so i keep hesitating and putting it off/spoiler
  fucked up the spoiler  just fuck my shit up senpai
  spotted the crossboarder
  i mean technically you could do the float effect but itd be like a weinerville puppet
id love to do something like spectre knight but i have no clue how to make stuff with eva foam or how i would even make the scythe and have it easily portable
id love to do the stranger from furi but i dont got the money/energy/time to do it plus its kinda obscure
for obvious reasons doesnt help that im a fucking autist whod want to incorporate the sword launcher thing somehow either
time and money are the main issues he isnt really obscure but ace attorney isnt as popular as it was        dont worry im smaller than that and im doing a joseph cosplay this year also hes not as big that the anime makes him to be hes supposed to weight 95kg at 195m so not even body builder status jonathan is 110kg at the same height and just as slim for comparison
  do it people will recognize you as godot is pretty popular and the only real difficult part is the visor  bonus points if you make it light up
  thanks for the encouragement anon ill certainly do it next year
id love to cosplay talizorah from mass effect but her suit is so intricate plus i have no idea how to make helmets or shoes or prop guns still a dream though hope to be able to craft it or commission it one day shes one of my favorite characters
haha i have a list about 100 entries long of cosplays i want to do im at about 2 costumes per year so i may be done by 2068 wish me luck
  this is my post and i just saw it again as im planning out to do it its funny to see how my dream cosplay hasnt changed several months in
this thread has encouraged me to work on a cosplay ive been putting off for 3 years sewing it as we speak
  nice what is it
  gohatto disco miku the me of 3 years ago would be very happy to now its finally getting made
  it was two months ago id hope that a dream cosplay wouldnt change in two months
  helmet is fairly easy there are pepakura files so print cut glue fiberglass paint add the visor    as for prop weapons again most can be done off pepakura files    now the body suit however if you arent good at sowing that would definitely be something you would want to hire out or work twords
  do it anyway life is short and cosplay is about interpretation of our fave characters anyway live our dreams anon
  no spoilers on /cgl/ senpai
  start small with cheap craft foam build your skill in small projects and then work up its a fun pastime and you can feel confident in the fact that youll be able to achieve your dream one day
  that one is also on my list one of the first anime i watched when i was small
what costumes do you want to do but fear that its so obscure that no one would get the reference
  i have a few on my list that are from mildly popular french franchises they might get recognized by some in france but internationally no chance
  zenkichi hideyoshi from medaka box    favorite manga by far but its a bit obscure
one of these days ill figure out a way to cosplay patrick with his head in the trombone
  i live for the day to see this happen
  i can see the problem maybe a con that gets a lot of international visitors like sdcc      cute character i looked into this expecting a hey thats a cool costume moment but after reading the synopsis now ive added it to my queue what have you done to me
  i want to do a character based largely around kicking but i dont dedicate the time to the flexibility needed to take great photos and most of the characters im interested in that are known for kicking are female and im not into crossplaying i need to find a male character who kicks a lot work on my splits and get my shit together
  deku from my hero academia season 2 costume his special move is a kick theres also iida who uses a kick in his special move
  two months late but i havent seen anyone acknowledge this show since 2010
i dont really want to do this one unless i had someone be kat with me since i feel like by herself shes fairly obscure
  kinda obscure might end up doing it after finishing the 2 i have lined up though
  im in europe sdcc is a far off dream if i could go to a us con id likely pick katsucon or dragoncon over sdcc too
  its not exactly the same look but you can simulate a hole using an infinity mirror theyre not super complicated to make
  shes hot though so youd get attention even from people who dont recognize the character
  ah the curse of uscentric thoughts strike again sorry anon i know sdcc isnt the right choice thematically for your costume i was just thinking of the amount of international visitors shit maybe travel to a french convention since youre in europe good luck in your endeavors either way
  i doubt thats the kind of attention op was looking for though orbiters and fans of the franchise act much differently even when theyre just looking for tiddies
  i dont want people thinking im some random ass goth girl i know gravity rush is popular in some circles but overall its still a fairly obscure series
i really want to do this guy at some point but its from an obscure spanish tabletop game and i have no idea if anyone would recognize it where i am stateside
  maybe not but thats a dope ass costume either way youd definitely get some attention for your craftsmanship
  i dont care i dont know what its from that looks sick and you should do it
i really enjoyed human revolution and remember being struck by how cool david sarifs vest is and now that im getting more into prop building his arm would be an interesting challenge to make  dont think hes that memorable though and i dont typically go to gaming conventions where hed be more recognizable  aaaaadam
  i cosplay kat but have never had a raven id say go for it anyway because i still got mild recognition as kat and if you go to east coast cons lets me know
i dont know how obscure this really is but id like to make sea fairy cookie from cookie run one day the thing is i want to make her hair and dress really look like water but i havent figured out exactly how yet
what patterns and colors would be best for the changing season
  
these are from a tumblr called kimonocolours    as for op i think bright vivid colors dont make a lot of sense for winter aside from reds/greens due to christmas even then you can find reds that arent in your face blooming flower and fruit motifs id say wouldnt quite fit either
fur shawls are so adorable they seem like a great idea to keep warm and to winterize any kimono
so heres the kimono i bought from ichiroya in the last thread do you think the hanhaba obi works with it
  i personally think it was a great choice especially with the yellow flowers and the yellow in the kimono itself    can anyone drop some seasonal inspiration i see differences between dress for the spring and fall but im not practiced enough to be able to pick it out myself what colors and motifs work better in different seasons
  there are the so called autumn flowers  for spring are the cherry flowers 
  autumn flowers
  wore it out today and got a lot of positive reactions closest thing to a negative reaction was some guy shouting she aint chinese at me after seeing my face
  sounds like a success  was the guy being aggressive or just shocked/confused
  aggressive but in a way thats kind of stereotypical of 2030 year old africanamerican men i had initially planned on just going to class today but i remembered a bit too late i had to run some errands so i ended up wearing it to a few stores and a bar for dinner
  shoulda shouted neither is my fucking kimono at him imagine race baiting while being as oblivious as that dick
  gross sounds like an ignorant shithead granted i know most black people just talk like that like their voices are just aggressive even when they dont seem to be upset shits weird    im glad your first day out in it went well im guessing the bar went well youre so much braver than me im still pouring over different kimono options and styles endlessly
  yeah kind of hard to say no to 250 yuenglings and 2 pizza slices and it was right by ulta and macys
    aww anon i can agree with  after hanging around some black people sometimes their voices can come off aggressive when they dont mean it but its hard to tell when its a stranger    this gave me the courage to wear one of my kimonos when i go grocery shopping later though
    that looks so good im so envious
does anyone know what this symbol means on this nagoya obi i already bought it because its gorgeous but my phone is translating it to disaster lol
tried for a more winter look this time also got a dark blue velvet machiyuki
i got  in today    i am very disappointed there are tons of stains and it is very yellowed they heavily edited the auction photos and didnt photograph the majority of the stains it doesnt look anything like the beautiful pale blue    the construction on it is still great but they forgot to mention the prominent staining on the left chest and to the interior     between this and the way it came packaged the box was ripped in two and was packing taped put together and it cost like 18 for shipping i am never buying from ebth again another kimono i got from them arrived with undescribed damage as well    the shipping boxes which are just folded pieces of cardboard with packing tape were just the shit cherry on top    on a different note best way to wash kimonos i paid 110  shipping for this thing wonder if there is anything i can do to restore it dry cleaning soap bath
  i love it the red contrasts really well with the blue is your hairpin a butterfly hairpin      i checked and got that too but maybe an anon who knows moonspeak can help      thats a nightmare gull im so sorry i figure kimono care is very similar to care for lolita items dry cleaning is probably a safe first bet
  i think its looking very good the colors of the kimono is in contrast with the obi and the socks it gives a really nice composition maybe different shoes so the straps are not white to have a foreground/background anyway it looks great how many kimono do you have      ho no thats terrible i suggest going to check a professional laundry service they probably can help
  hair clip i made it a while back when i was bored though it probably wouldnt be too hard to turn it into a hair pin      technically 4 i kind of impulse bought the one im wearing in the latest pic and the one i won in that auction someone posted in the last thread got shipped to my parents house by mistake and yeah im not really happy with the color of the straps on the geta
  chrysanthemum/ mums great pattern
  sorry but what did you expect for that price secondhand kimono arent usually that cheap
  nayrt it was an auction though the buyers set the price based on the photos and if they heavily edited the photos then they fooled the buyers if i was anon id file a complaint or try to get my money back thats so unacceptable
  is it okay to wear furisode tomosode if you are already married and a little older the ones with the glorious long sleeves and black colorways
  this is probably my favorite coord youve done yet the colors just mesh so well i love it      if youre in the west it doesnt matter go for it if youre in japan or plan on visiting you can make a tomosode   which is what married and older women wear by shortening the sleeves of a furisode
i practiced a bit more today this combination may be my go to sadly the lighting in my house doesnt pick up the gorgeous dark plum almost navy of the kimono but the little bird motifs on this one make me happy
  nice to be completely honest im jealous of how neat your hair is the orange on your obi fits well with the birds in the pattern on your kimono and having spent the past several hours wearing geta i really wish i had the slippers you have on
  you arent used to them yet i guess why did you worn them for
  its not that im not used to them its just that i had to do a lot of walking
  i am delighted by your posts your coords would we call them that are visually pleasant
which color of obi would be the best for this yukata you think
  id say light green torquoise or orange/yellows would be good that looks like one with a lot of color choice possibilities
  i see thanks do you thinks some sort of red would work too
  it honestly would depend on the shade of red if it was a more orangeish red possibly or maybe a very deep red
  i agree with  a lot of colors can work with this one lavender/purple pinks golds blues etc would be fine i think a red could work if it was like an apple red a deep / dirty red might not look as good very pretty kimono though      this is the best compliment ever excuse my emoji use here but that makes me very happy _ ill try to post more often      bobby pins are my secret my hair is very frizzy lol as for the bun im using a bun maker from amazon not the doughnut ones but pic related my hair for reference is about a foot and a half long and these combined with bobby pins works wonders
    thank you you two  i can choose between these colors so i guess ill go with the purple or red one as its her favorite colors and shes doesnt like yellow  its supposed to be a gift thus the questions
  
how much bigger than you should your kimono and yukata be i got an ap yukata and it is a little uncomfortable unless im just putting it on wrong i do have pretty wide hips though i am measuring about 110112 cm at the widest point
  i dont think you could go wrong with either great gift though anon i think shell love it      im kind of in the same boat anon i have lost 30lbs and my hips have stayed at around 104cm  it sucks my kimonos just barely dont make it fully around by a couple of inches    with that much being said you probably need a kimono that is around 155cm or more in the waist if i had to guess just remember they have to fully reach around the front of your hips twice left and right panels so a safe bet is probably hip measurement  50 of hip measurement a little over wont hurt at all though    which ap yukata did you get btw they have such cute designs
  strawberry millefeuille i wanted to get an older one before shelling out for a new release i love the sweet lacy basket one
i should maybe have asked that before ordering but the does the tabi size displayed online are usually precise  because i was at the upper limite of the medium size and went with medium but i hope i didnt goofed and should have went one size bigger
  ver nice i want to get he in the future just not sure which one do they do regular releases for yukata only ever paid attention to their lolita releases       as long as youre not over the max cm length youre fine accuracy is going to vary wildly from store to store but generally ive found that things measured in cm are usually right
this thread is such a happy place i love it
  hey anon what did you end up doing about this i got my kimono in from them last night and same deal covered in stains that were not shown in the photos or description im very mad about it im thinking about filing some sort of dispute and was wondering if youd do the same the kimono is totally unwearable asis
  just got mine the condition wasnt bad but it was shorter than i thought itd be
  im no expert but im pretty sure that you and the other anon can file a complain with pictures as proofs the differences between the website and the product will be obvious and they will have to refund you  sorry for you by the way that must sucks
happy food coma day debating whether or not i want to dress up i got my disaster obi in and may practice later regardless      it really is it makes me happy      i havent done anything yet because to be honest i dont see a way to file a complaint just a contact for help but i suppose that will have to do     im going to take plenty of detailed pictures and send it to them i wish i had the thought to take a picture of the packaging but i was too excited to see the kimono i didnt even think to do that lesson learned somehow this is the first time in my 13 years of my auction and internet buying ive had this issue      one of the three kimonos i won came in almost described condition the only thing they didnt mention was a hole in the fabric about the size of a cigarette burn which is mended and is in pretty good condition the other one just has a lot of fraying but is in ok condition besides that glad yours made it out alive however
  i mean the one i ordered is too short but i could still wear it around the house
  i believe the yukata was a special release there is one every year it seems like usually in the summer i think theyre pretty hard to get and you need a ss if you really want to ensure you get one
  dont let it being too short stop you its pretty common for antique kimono to be too short for modern japanese girls so these underskirt pieces have become popular theyre pretty cute imo i know homsue_hem on ig is one maker their construction is very pretty in person im sure you could construct something similar if you have some basic sewing skill though
  thanks ill have to look into that the one shes wearing in that picture looks cute
    there was a pic posted a few months back with a woman wearing gaudy patterned socks to make the short length look intentional that might work for you too
hi gulls would this kimono and obi together be too matchy i really like how the obis circles would work with the print on the bottom of the kimono but i get the feeling they might be too close together to work properly looking at the pics others have posted do i need to start over or is this acceptable
  i think these are both gorgeous pieces and can go together    the great thing is that one kimono can go with a lot of obis and one obi can go with a lot of kimonos    i say dooo iiit i think itll look very formal and elegant
  i think a dark maybe even black haneri and dark undersash for the obi could add enough contrast/interest for the eye if youre worried about being too matchymatchy
  i think it will match pretty well but as previously stated there will be a formal aura emanating from these colors not that it is bad at all i think it looks great
heads up just got an email from ichiroya that they will be doing a cyber monday something no idea what it is just that they were going to try it     and i just told myself no more kimono stuff for now thisll be hard lol
  i submitted a ticket to them with details about the damages and am hoping to hear something back soon ill post an update when i do but i wont be buying from this site again and will close down my account once i hear something back most reviews and their terms make it sound like theyll do anything to get out of taking responsibility for damages so im not hopeful i took a lot of photos of the damages and pic related is two shots of unedited damage its pretty much covered with stains like those top to bottom
  oh gross those look like either coffee or dried blood hope things go well for you anon
    i was gonna say ive seen a lot of magazine photos with girls wearing glossy colourful pumps or boots or otherwise funky shoes and loud patterned socks idk its just so cute i love it
  everything about the black and white kimono is lovely except for the random naked barbie doll thing seems like a waste to have it ruined by such a stupid edgy hair accessory but hey what do i know
  ill experiment with it when i get home probably
  tried it with a few shoes and socks ironically liked the cowboy boots the best still not completely satisfied with it though
  just got a response back they basically said tough shit and that they make their descriptions to give an idea of condition and not accurately describe im closing my account with them now never again
  that really sucks sorry gull  i really dont understand how it is possible though thats borderline fraud
  reminds me of taisho era modern look
  this went horribly ended up buying two kimono two obi and a bunch of accessories
  nice post what you hauled when you receive it  im on the verge of buying a bunch of stuff too
  i had initially been planning to splurge on just one kimono but instead got two cheaper ones because i liked the designs one of the obi i got had been open in a tab on my browser for the past month though and thank god it wasnt sold since its perfect for a winter coord and should get here in time for christmas 
  cool experiment that kimono is looking great you makes me wonder if maybe theres something interesting to do with a nice pantyhose or high socks
  ill probably wear it tomorrow with patterned white socks and highheeled mary janes
how important it is to wear a juban under a yukata  i imagine it must look prettier but it is necessary
  i though yukata werent worn with a juban
  completely up to you you can just get a juban top if youre worried about it being warm and still want protection you can also just wear a tank top or something but i recommend wearing something to protect the yukata from sweat and such
  is your yukata machine washable most are so you dont have to worry about wearing a juban like you do with normal kimono
just realized most of my kimono wardrobe is of houmongi i like how more subtle their patterns are compared to furisode and komon are normally too boring for me glad its finally cold enough to wear them out now
  ended up wearing it with patterned white socks highheeled mary janes and a much older nagoya obi that i picked up for 15 from an importer at a con
  i feel like its up a little too high
  talked about it in a previous post  apparently antique kimono are often too short for modern women so one way to deal with that is to wear it with flashy tights and shoes or get some sort of underskirt i went with the flashy socks and shoes option
i wore one of my kimonos out for the first time today to run some quick errands got a lot of compliments and questions feltgoodman      i like the colors though i feel like the shoes need a lil more pizzazz than just mary janes to really tie it together not a bad option all in all just kind of plain looks comfy regardless
  yeah i know thats what youre going for but i would consider   to be like the highest without looking weird
  its looking really cute well done anon
  pics of the outfit
anybody will dress in kimono for the new year
  i might depending on my family theres a christmas market at the city hall here so most likely il end up going to that in kimono with some classmates
this thread is literally just one girl cam whoring herself out
  theres at least two but itd be nice to see more variety
  not her fault no one else is contributing its a good thread with good content
  and yet the anon is contributing more than you and the thread is still very good  off with you
post cool cosplay from the event
old thread in autosage 
i joined the ctp bandwagon    i am also super looking forward to listening to those headphones
super stoked for all of this especially the red nurse set i might be the only person outside of korea who was able to get one and its my favorite color
  anon where did you get the flower lights im always looking for room decor anyways this is the only /cgl/ related thing i have in the mail right now its a secondhand algonquins jacket i grabbed for 1230 nevermind the fact that i told myself that i was going to try and wear less black this winter
  the lights are from wish its cheaper and about the same quality as buying them locally except i have to wait something like this is not too urgent though and i never saw rose shaped lights where i live    the listing i bought also comes in many different led colours
  woah beyond stunning gets anon i didnt even know st esther came in red x black holy hell that colorway looks so good im guessing it was exclusive to something in korea based on what you said
  thank you     yeah the red/black was love at first sight i had to get it it was exclusive to the lief halloween party this year and there were very few of them they asked people to not use shopping services as they were for party guests only but there was one left that didnt sell and they advertised it on their twitter i sent them an email regarding it and they sold it to me i was so happy about it i actually also got this brooch to wear with both of my st esther sets that i forgot about im excited to coord the red with the white apron as well
  its on the website stop embarrassing yourself by being the only one
  huh yeah totally embarrassed myself    thats a soldout listing jagoff i bought the only one they advertised online
  somebody sounds jealous desu
  dont be discouraged with secondhand shoes they just need a little extra love get yourself a bottle of the gorilla glue clear epoxy a magic eraser and new laces and you have a perfect little shoe repair kit i get some of the nicest shoes because i buy them damaged and just repair them usually its an easy fix
an artist i follow just posted a screenshot of them purchasing ax 2019 artist alley tickets 2 days ago ummmmmmm wtf did i miss something
  this is gross youll never wash away all the bacteria and fungus as you do with second hand clothes
  you can however kill it shoe disinfectant spray exists for a reason anon
hope the image doesnt look gross when i post anyway this is just a mini yumekawaii/fairy kei haul i have coming
  very cute
so i never make mail posts because i never buy more than 2 things at a time i also have an ap coat iw headbow to complete my three archangels set and a few ap accessories from ya but i forgot to add them in my collage  also does it count as mail if its in a mto and wont be with you until next year      that middle dress is on my wishlist i have the lavender but its so comfy i want all colourways congrats anon
repost  has anyone had packages from japan go missing and hopefully return if so what was the timeline    i item was sent around the 10th last month and hasnt been updated since the 13th where it said it left japan or about to i think it was shipped air but its possible it was sal it thought it was a small package but not small enough to go in an packet/padded envelope nad the post people said it had to be sent in a box   ive recieved aliexpress orders already that i ordered over a week after this package was shipped
after i made this i was like well shit i should really slow down on my purchases for a good long while     iw free shipping also we have a red tartan op    i am weak
  this happens all the time sal/air is slow as shit because its the lowest of low priority this is also the busiest time of year for mail some packages taking much longer than others shipped by sal/air at the same time is not unusual at all because they just ship things according to available space at every stage of the process    theres seriously no predicting how long it will take to be returned to sender if it is but it probably hasnt even gone through your customs yet     sorry its not really good news but sal/air is a bad choice if you care for your package to be delivered on a reliable schedule
  the headphones just arrived and oh wow they are great i definitely reccomend them even if youre a firm wired headphone fan       i feel you so much anon i spend and then spend again even though i shouldnt haveluckily this has gotten better recently as it appears impulse control issues was a side effect of a medication i was taking doesnt mix well with lolita
  nice haul where are the hats from          it must have been sal then i almost exclusively use small packet air shipping when i order anything and the absolute longest an order took to arrive was somewhere between 2 and 3 weeks
  air is usually faster than sal so sounds like you got stuck with sal sorry but hey although sal takes forever the package actually being lost is very rare hope you get it soon
most of these things i bought quite a while ago but japonica was busy and customs has been super slow so im only just now getting some of themthe picture of the tartan iw jsk isnt from the listing i bought that listing had a shitty picture and lolibrary has no stock photos of this dress so i used an image i had saved in my wishlist folder    im gonna be so damn comfy this winter
  love those hats
  excellent taste anon that jetj dress is one of my dds
posted in the last thread but added some stuff considering also ordering from antique beast while theyre open but that might be taking it too far before this batch of orders id only bought one dress in the last year and prior to that it was one or two dresses per year still had a decent wardrobe but was getting tired of it
  forgot to also add these
  damn i wanted to get middle right but it was gone by the time i got paid glad it went to a gull at least
  what is the dress on the middle right new dd
  that shampoo is life changing
  thanks i actually had it before and regret selling it big time so im glad i was able to find it again      sorry about that if it arrives and doesnt work out for me then ill post it here for you      id link you but it appears that lolibrary is down at the moment i believe its called lace up velveteen jsk by innocent world
  thank you its just gorgeous
  i know right that bottle lasts me half a year too and i have long hair i pair it with a mask from a small local company and i get complimented on my hair all the time
  could i ask where you got the iw tartan dress from i am desperately looking for red colorway i want to know when i missed green
  i know im for sure using retail therapy im really trying to stop i think in a way making these collages helps to keep me in check at least a little bit until i can get back to therapy lol           thanks theyre from axes femme i waffled a bit too long and the black one sold out which i am bummed about lol
  i found it on yjapan heres the auction link in case youd like it     ive only seen it for sale twice including the one i bought but both times it was pretty cheap so you probably wont have to pay much for it when it does pop up
im leaving a relatively well paid job to go back to school next fall so im buying some cute casual things to wear to uni while i still have the money im going to study biology so im looking for some nature themed things to add to my wardrobe
  thanks i rarely check yjapan anymore so that explains why i hadnt seen it luckily i already own the green skirt
  someone has a size 2 of it for sale in the bst thread if youre actuvely looking anon
i was not planning to buy from alis 11/11 sale at all this year but i realized that i desperately need long sleeved shirts and some bottoms that im allowed to wear at work i also threw in some jewelry ive had my eye on for a while    tfw only 96 for all of this  feels good man
i feel in love with this dress i hope it looks alright on me
  i bought that same suspender skirt
  the bunny skirt is lovely may i have a link to it
  link to bottom heart earrings please
babbys first taobao order  i know there is a taobao thread but i like the op of this one more
  whats the fabric on the bottom left
  its actually tights i got them as a gift last christmas and want more of them
  how is the material does it have any stretch      i wasnt sure which one you wanted so i linked both for you         
      now i wanna try that shampoo link
  wtc tights link please
  can you post a pic when it arrives it looks super cute
  its awapuhi wild ginger by paul mitchell i bought it from amazon      
excited
  im so glad ll rereleased this dress because it was so rare before
excuses for stealing this pic from an lj wardrobe post so glad to find a if the price is right if anyone else is looking they still have a bunch of painting sks and jsks left 
  i just bought it on 11/11 so i know about as much as you do about it sorry
    that rose basket in pink still not snatched up    thanks based anon i never know when these updates happen despite being subscribed to them on twitter
this will be my first time getting a lucky pack i hope itll be worth it  also ctp hype
  post ur lp when it comes in 
got paid just a couple of hours ago so time for some good old retail therapy    the bags arent exactly in the mail since they are actually preordered and wont be shipped until january but still excited
    it was a friend shipping me something and apparently she opted for the cheapest option not realizing it was sal when she told me it had to be a box instead of a packet i assumed it was at least air because of the way us and some eu shipping force you to take certain methods after a certain weight     since its been another week with no update im sure its sal i shipped two check through suitcases home sal once and it took two weeks so hopefully it comes within the next three weeks
i was considering a few other things at cc but it felt wrong to get something other than another suspender skirt with these 2
only picked up one lolitarelated item on black friday  this op from lm this will be my second vm op and im pumped to wear it to work i always get compliments when i wear it so im glad to have another slowly building my collection of office appropriate dresses    nonlolita related but i also picked up a pair of insulated winter boots rated for 25f i dont know how ive survived in new england for 8 years without a proper pair of winter boots
i still cant believe it
  congratulations how much was it
  46600 yen  thank god i feared these sets would go to a reseller
    nope just me theyre going to be nicely steamed and hung up and worn and cherished ive been on holiday visiting family so i was super surprised that my sniper bid did the trick    im the most excited about anastasiapic related as i havent seen it go on sale before
  congrats anon thats my dream dress wear it well
tight got changed to cream luckily that doesnt change my coord that much the bronzer i got for free with the highlight so lets see how that works out for me

  whats the top right im in love
  its physcial drop and im selling it didnt end up liking it    
i just received my first package from antique beast and im stunned havent even opened the package but the printed parcel she used is so elegant and beautiful i went to the post office to pick it up and couldnt stop smiling as soon as i saw it
  love that sweet dreamer hat i would buy it but i would also never wear it so cute though
  what did you get anon buying from antique beast is always such a pleasant experience its really worth the wait
oof my wallet    oh one or two good mercari purchases cant hurt  free shipping weekend with iw well this is rare ill cave  mto for the stupid hairclip i missed with meta fuck yes but damn so much shipping for so little  boz special set is 100 perfect and i like every piece  cheap homerunchan figs pop up fig case i just bought is a bit empty anyways  just now learn since i bought the kotobukiya in 2015 that bakura has gotten all the merch time to buy everything  black friday / cyber monday in buying gifts and expensive stuff for new home    in iw complaining im really annoyed that it took them a week to process my order they say oh sorry you missed out on the lauretta otks and of course theyre still in stock online after they ship double checked that they knew i ordered the beige ones ugh got the gray items in too and the jacket isway thinner than i thought it would be for a fall release in small iw happiness the ushanka of my dreams is coming to me for perfect fur trimmed winter coords    beyond hype to make my first itabag though im blown away at how nice yugiohs 20th anniversary has been to my childhood husbando picking a bag feels like itll be the hardest part ugh
  tbh i got it for one specific coord and i have no idea what to do with it afterwards time to plan witch coords i guess
waiting on these also on some honeycolor lenses also on a stratia haul also on a bunch of aliexpress stationery i might have gone a bit over budget this month
i dont need any more palettes but cute packaging
if anons feel like it can you start adding prices too im new to jfashion and lolita i would like to know what anons here consider a fair or good price for what they bought
  thats entirely subjective anon a baby op scored on auctions for 30 is a great find while someones rare and coveted dream dress scored for 300 can also be considered an amazing find have you browsed the secondhand market at all you can learn these things by browsing and forming your own opinion and perspective of whats worth a certain price tag and what isnt
  i agree with you on the subjectivity but i do mean to take it into account if someone buys an ap dress for 200usd it means it was worth it for them i might still reach the conclusion 200usd is too much    i can understand if someone doesnt feel like adding the price though its more work and some consider money a sensitive topic     i do browse secondhand web stores btw i just thought adding prices to this thread or at least to some of the comments would be informative as well
  congratulations i had my eye on this listing but it went out of my budget quickly im glad it went to someone who really wanted the pieces
  i mostly buy ap i consider most solid dresses from 20082012 a good deal if it costs around 70 usd prints rarer dresses and newer dresses are more subjective i also would never post the specific amount i spent on a purchase
just bought my ultimate dream dress and matching tea parties im so happy
  what is this beauty bay i did a quick search and they have an official domain is it worth for cheap makeup or any benefits
  where did you find it
  was this that super damaged one     congrats on the find milky planet was my first dd
  someone on the dream dress thread offered to sell my theirs a few threads back and i jumped on it right away      no its in excellent condition according to the seller and thank you mine too specifically in this colorway and i never thought i would get my hands on it but here i am 8 years later and its getting delivered just in time for christmas
  what are those tea parties anon
  just a make up seller i use for brands i otherwise cant access from my tiny ass country without getting major customs fees because europe they do have good sales from time to time and i think they recently launched a loyalty program    so if youre a eurofag like me and dont like customs its pretty neat
  wow congrats thats amazing im so happy for you happy christmas anon

  thanks anon    shoes     necklace     star/moon charms 
i had no idea what i was going to wear for christmas but then this popped up now im just hoping itll get here in time what with the crazy workload the postal service usually has around the holidays
saturday is international lolita day what are your plans you doing a lone lolita event private lolita event or you doing an event with your lolita comm
my comm had a meet planned but it got cancelled so ill ask some friends if they want to hang out the meet wasnt to my taste so nothing much lost there i like hanging out with my friends more anyway    also what is the print in the op pic
  im so sad i started buying lolita in july/august and have a full coord but my bodyline shoes broke last time i wore them so i wont be able to celebrate plus i recently lost my job so this isnt exactly something i can just be spending money on oh well my comms event is so fucking stupid almost makes it ok i have to wait another 6 months for next ild
  this is the lamest fucking excuse i have heard for a street fashion muh shoes cant wear clothes
  god even if i wore fucking sneakers i still didnt want to go to the event im not going to go out in public and not match my shoes and look stupid sorry i care about important things
  
  the op pic anon      its infantas strawberry kitchen
i was trying to plan an ild meet but it ended up being scheduled later in the month for the holidays instead not mad just dissapointed because i missed summer ild
tried to get a comm event together but no one is interested or available so i will just be celebrating by myself my mother and i are going out to pick out christmas trees for our homes so i thought maybe then i can wear a nice christmasy coord
my comm is putting together something but its being hosted by someone insufferable so im not sure if i want to go because of that
the insufferable drama whores are not going to ild for once finally im excited that i wont have to deal with these bitches pretend to be nice to everyones faces waiting to shitpost about everyone as soon as they get to the parking lot to leave
  la com
ill be attending a small con so ill be wearing lolita that day havent worn it in over a year
    please just go back to your noob corner and stay there      newbies like you always reinforce my personal belief that new lolitas are the nastiest online
its exam season so im probably just going to dress up and study at home
  my comms event is so fucking stupid  im glad you wont ruining their time with your bullshit then
were doing something later this month but depending on how bad/decent the weather and driving conditions are i might throw something last minute i just want an excuse to wear my festive pieces
god id love to do something for ild but the local comm isnt doing anything and my only other lolita friend is away may just wear a special coord and head into town for tea and cake with a normie friend
  this sounds really cute anon     im a lonelita so going for a winter walk and stopping at a cute cafe for cakes and hot chocolate with my so
  yup same here maybe ill take a walk to relax a bit good luck anon
im really pumped because im going to an ott meet and i usually dont get to celebrate ild in a big way but i dont have a solid coord plan so i guess im just going to wing it
im a lonelita probably wont do anmything im sad
  celebrate indoors thats what i do i just sink into nostalgia and do all the fun things i loved to do read watch and listen to when i was a newbie
my comm is meeting on the 8th instead of this weekend and ive been so uninspired and feeling depressed im thinking about wearing my very first brand that i wore to my first ild even though it is more summer appropriate i can winterize the coordinate it at least cheers me up to look at my progress
  same but ill probably drag my non lolita friend to tea
  stl comm
  you and me both anon  might just sit at home and have some fancy tea
  oh is this london comm if so the people are really nice so if you just talk to them they can make you feel nicer i was going through a similar feeling last week
  london  o  n  d  o  n
  that sounds like a cute idea anon you should do it im sure your comm will be happy to see you and will encourage your progress
    quit trying to guess that anon probably isnt even here anymore
  gee i was just trying to help the anon feel better
  how does outing some anon do that
  they didnt have to answer yes or no i wasnt forcing them just trying to encourage them a lot of people in the comm are suffering from seasonal depression right now its dark and rainy up here
my grandparents are coming down from nottinghamshire and we are going out to have dinner with them in the evening so ill wear lolita to dinner
  fuck off with your concern trolling you dont need to know who anyone is on this fucking board
  saying yes i am one of 150 people does not equal outting yourself  otherwise the two people who asked would be outing themselves    off topic but on topic im glad to know im not the only one with a flakey ass comm
  meant for  
  london comm isnt normally flakey but literally nobody showed interest for the meet up i think
  why are you so mad
not doing anything for the weekend because of football proud fan of my alumni being in their championship game next weekend is our hanukkah and frills meetup im making 4 dozen latkes
desu if there are a lot of people who want to meet up in the london comm we could meet somewhere like winter wonderland but for free instead of paying like the meet would be late notice i know but if youre down im down
  not gonna pay 15 to go somewhere thats free sorry
  agreed it was also looking to be a bit more expensive than that desu
  im down id love that desu post about it in the comm and im sure more people will join in
im so excitedgoing to my first ever meet 
  what comm is this with a hannukah meetup lemme join you guys    tfw im the only jew at the christmas meetup

  are you and i in the same comm if you are i rolled my eyes hard af when i heard who was hosting i pity whoever has to tolerate her at meets
how has cosplay influenced your self image for better or for worse
i made this thread because cosplay has helped me tremendously in how i view myself it has given me the motivation to lose weight and has given me more confidence in my appearance and personality     however ive also heard a lot of stories about cosplay lowering peoples self esteem because of catty people and the ill never be as x as him/her mindset what are your thoughts
i stopped cosplaying as much because it started to feel like a competition and i started to heavily compare myself to others in a very negative way i also recieved sexual comments on my posts and it made me very uncomfortable because they werent sexual cosplays im trying to get back into it though and am currently working on something but i cant help comparing myself to others and hating myself for being so shitty
its a mixed bag for me personally    im one of those people who has never really liked any pictures of themself even as a kid i hated stuff like my body posture or facial expressions in photos im not overweight but i hate being seen with my shirt off i have a giant forehead and a shitty hairline that im selfconscious about i dont know how to take good selfies and apart from cosplays theres only one or two pictures of me posted on facebook each year  i dont think of cosplay as escapism from selfloathing per se but theres something about embodying a different character that makes me feel good and want to be seen cosplay completely changes my perspective on photos of myself  and my selfimage  even though i feel awkward sometimes walking from the parking garage to the show once im there i feel great  there is something in cosplay that motivates me to improve myself but im still not confident enough in my body to cosplay some characters id like to junkrat joseph joestar etc    where i think cosplay helps me more is in artistic fulfillment  as a kid i loved halloween or spirit days at school going to cons as an adult lets me keep doing costumes while having dramatically more resources to improve my craft  but more so its a much more physical form of art i used to do more drawing but its harder to show that off inperson wearing a costume at a con is unavoidable  people will notice you and its that much easier to get positive reinforcement for my hard work
for me its a confidence booster i know when a cosplay is a miss it doesnt get much attention but i dont let that get to me i know i have a few classics in my costume collection that always gets attention no matter how old the series/character gets plus i have a few that always get attention even when people have no clue what its from i personally feel that as long as you arent posting every little wip to instagram or other social media as public posts you wont get body shamed or harassed too much    comparing yourself to others is always toxic to me its about doing the best job that i can and getting recognition for my work is fulfilling it doesnt matter if someone did it better as long as im happy with the results
hit a zen point about self image after a year of being on instagram id been a strictly tumblr  cons cosplayer before make something post progress wear it to a con post full photos later moderate interaction and attention which i was fine with     joined ig because a lot of friends were there and people at cons always asked for that mode of contact found that the layout of the profiles puts the follower count as one of the first things that visitors see and thus use to gauge the quality of your profile versus tumblr where its hidden went through the mental ride of   feel like i need a higher follower count  jump through algorithm hoops to see what could increase it  feel inadequate when nothing seems to happen while people with an emphasis on beauty/makeup/selfies scoop up online attention much more quickly      then remembered that im past high school and dont need to care about popularity anymore i checked in on the original reason for why i cosplay creating stuff is satisfying and let that be my impetus for being on social media there are occasional twinges of /wish there were more eyes on my work/ but it feels good to have genuine engagement versus tagtrawling bots or generic meaningless comments i value myself as a craftsperson more rather than a pretty face or a model  and this feels like a more sustainable way to approach the hobby youll only be conventionally attractive for so many years and then people will find the next youthful face to fawn over     appearance and bodywise sewing garments helped me acknowledge certain aspects that id had body image issues about for a long time clothes look better if theyre tailored well and you only achieve that by being honest about your measurements
i almost did lewds because my friends who did them were more popular    luckily i came to my senses but many girls go down that road sadly
it sometimes feels like a secret identity that carries me through everyday life its nice to be interacting with people at work i dont make a habit of telling people about the hobby unless it comes up and know that two days ago i was wearing a dress with 60 hours worth of beading and embroidery on it
  it seems like the cosplay community is a constant battle for who does it best which is really sad i hope youre able to find confidence in your cosplay eventually and balance the motivation to improve with being proud of your work also hearing those types of inappropriate comments is terrible and i think it also deals with the stigma of cosplay being exclusively sexy when thatt not the case at all      i can relate a lot about what youve said about photos ive been insecure with myself for the longest time and its hard to get used to seeing yourself in pictures when youve avoided it for so long its fantastic that cosplay helps you with that though and its a good thing to have goals like cosplaying joseph and junk rat to motivate you but they both have pretty extreme body types so keep that in mind if youre setting standards for yourself      im sorry that happened to you anon its sadly understandable why a lot of girls go that route considering how cosplay culture holds having a lot of followers/likes as a very important thing i really admire cos players who have a big following based on their skill and personality rather than looks or revealing outfits i think it sets a good example to young people trying to get into cosplay and building their social media following
in line at store  checkout lady says how are you and enjoy your day to the person in front of me they say it to the person behind me but they dont say it to me  why  its not just this one person either its nearly anyone  dad and i were at shops and same person said it to him though so i know its me why  today my friend and i were buying something and we were both standing in silence as she scanned then she randomly said hows your day going to him i never get that  this is why i like the self checkouts  cgl related cosplays done nothing to help or hinder
im fat im not even 200 pounds but im heavy for my height and dont carry my weight well i used to hate how i looked but over the years that started to change cosplay has changed the way i view myself im still not happy with how i look and im working on changing myself and getting healthier but im starting to accept myself as i am for now im surrounded by friends who support me in both my cosplays and my goals in health i have people who look up to me as a cosplayer and thats something i never thought would happen
i usually feel confident and excited when wearing cosplay but when i get actual photos back i loathe the fact that i have a body and wish i looked different sometimes i start to feel upset and embarrassed that i had felt okay with myself when actually wearing the cosplay   i try to remind myself that im not a teenager anymore and cant expect myself to have the exactly same body as the 15yearold fictional japanese girls i cosplay it also helps to ask myself if id ever be so critical of any other cosplayer for their body type since 999 of the time i find that i would never say the things i say to myself to anyone else   one positive thing is that i use my dissatisfaction with my body to fuel better eating and exercise incorporating my love of the character into my motivation
i have a very thin feminine body but i hide it with large baggy clothing wear very little daily makeup and basically look like a boy if i didnt have cosplay i probably wouldve reduced or removed my boobs by now since theyre large and a pain cosplay is one space where i feel comfortable being feminine and being looked at as pretty and its definitely improved my selfworth and social anxiety its also helped me keep up some semblance of an exercise routine which is swell    i used to get very stressed about making cosplays but now that ive stopped doing groups and 5 new cosplays per con im at peace i just really enjoy sewing and making at my own pace
  sage for ot but   1 dont overthink it its not you consider it from the point of someone whos working 8 hours in a retail job on their feet saying the same things the entire time to a blurry stream of faces a clerk is making nonstop small talk for the entire time theyre working checkout dont hold it against folks for wanting to give their voiceboxes a break    2 are you doing anything to invite greeting do you smile and make eye contact as a nonverbal acknowledgment when its your turn to get checked out do you say hey/hello/good morning/literally anything to the person do you ask them how theyre doing     if it bothers you try changing the factors that you have control over
  thanks ill give it a go appreciate the feedback
both     i was more tomboyish before cosplay ive always been a stickler for doing things right so i put a lot of effort in researching how to be a good cosplayer i learned a lot about makeup and how to present myself in pictures and in public i started to apply this knowledge to everyday life     since i look nicer now and people respond to that i guess that gives me an ego boost but at the same time ive become a lot more critical of my appearances ive gone into unhealthy crash course diets for cosplay before i guess i want to hold myself up to my new standards and missing the mark makes me feel worse about myself
im in a 50/50 situation i feel really good when im wearing the cosplay and having fun but as soon as i see photos of myself later on i feel terrible and hate how i looked    i guess i keep going because i figure eventually ill be able to make myself look good enough to get back flattering pictures though i usually just try and avoid having them taken now
cosplay helped me start to care about my looks and take better care of myself
  im not ugly but ive realized ill never be the cute anime girl i want to be
i know how to apply make up because of it lol
  i feel like i am not as good of a cosplayer as i can be because of my small bust
  wow are you me my first cosplay i had a photographer with a great camera and great shots that he showed me right after taking a few like in person on his camera then a few days later he uploaded an album of all his shots and the only picture of me in the album was heavily edited my eyes looked like white little dots with heavy color editing and no other photo in the album was as edited as mine it took a huge hit to my ego/selfsecurity as i consider myself attractive but man to be the only overedited photo out of am album of otherwise good pictures i mean it looked like shit it just feels bad and makes you think you were the problem    i havent cosplayed since but i would love to again and actually get better pictures i have control over next time
  i want to do boy cosplay lewds i feel theres a large untapped market for cute male cosplay stuff
  not really ive seen quite a few men do lewds and its 50 muscular guys and 50 twinks   i also think that women and gay guys are less inclined to sink a lot of money into cosplay lewds than straight men are
  i think i could pull off a lot of cosplays most twinks couldnt pull off a lot of it is facial structure and younger looks
  its great that you have a lot of friends and supporters in cosplay im still trying to find cosplay friends because im too quiet and dont talk to people enough and having people who look up to my cosplay would be a dream that must be an amazing feeling       i feel upset about that sometimes too but i try to remind myself that a lot of how a person looks depends on the lighting angle and other aspects its hard but it helps when you keep those things in mind when viewing pictures       id feel like shit if i was in your position too but theres a good chance that he overedited it because the lighting was bad or because he simply thought it would look better as opposed to make you more attractive when youre comfortable enough to cosplay again and you get a better photographer youll probably be way happier with how your pics turned out
  picture anon here my picture was the only one taken outside in 6pm daylight sun setting in the shade and all the other ones were in the hotel lobby so that is a possibility but i definitely am planning on cosplaying next convention i attend and making sure to get some good pictures myself luckily i have a willing bf to take photos for me he was in his learning curve for my first cosplay which is why i didnt have many good photos of my own haha
  cosplayer here whos done photos on the side on days when i dont feel like cosplaying and a small sidenote/disclaimer that sometimes photos look way better in the tiny preview screen than they do once you upload them ive taken photos that looked like winners on the preview but when reviewing the full images afterwards they were badly out of focus or the lighting got fucked or any dozen other things     it doesnt excuse bad overediting on the photogs part but ive learned to not get too hyped over the potential of a photo based on how it looks right after snapping it
  it seems like it was likely a combination of the lighting and editing then its not uncommon for shitty photographers to take a picture in bad lighting and compensate for it with adjustments that look very unrealistic i think that having your bf take the photos is a way better idea because then you can try out different lighting to see what flatters you and which photos would need the least editing
cosplay has helped a lot with my self image im usually one of the better looking girls in the group so i get tons of compliments i wish could wear full cosplay makeup every day but it takes like 2 hours sadly its the makeup i feel best in
  i have a very similar story fb and ig made me obsessed with algorithm hacking keeping up a flawless public image constantly having to post content the same routine everyone does my effort with my costume felt worthless when i didnt receive enough likes and comments i i was especially paranoid about being gossiped about and became neurotic about my looks    now a few years later im hitting my 30s i have a great career with my day job outside of cosplay and a lot of other stuff keeping me busy i like making costumes because its fun and i dont care about even updating my social media or posting wips anymore looking back i feel dumb for being so hellbent on becoming cosfamous i still worry about my costumes not being good enough or my face being ugly but not nearly as much as before now i just want to dress up as my favourite characters without giving a fuck about the whole social media game i have too much stuff in my life to live for thats actually meaningful    young cosplayers stop taking cosplay so seriously dont get sucked into the being cosfamous dream its simply not worth itthe amount of likes youll receive will never be enough
my face is unnatractive by western standards but in elaborate cosplays i dont feel insecure about it since theres enough to distract from it however i have an ed because i can only pick males/genderbends am grill to cosplay do e to my unnatractive face it makes it a little worse since i need to stay underweight for it to look right
im an extremely insecure person like i didnt take pictures of myself for years before getting really into cosplay last year looking at myself kind of makes me want to die cosplay makes that complicated     i think before i was into it i didnt really think too much about my looks even though i was also very into makeup i guess it was often more about the skill and the art there and i was a good enough canvas but now that i do a lot of cosplay im much more critical i think the difference is before i would see a pic and be like ew thats me and now its ew thats me and i look ugly    and also before i was equally selfconcious about all parts of me but now its shifted i dont think i have a bad body in fact its pretty nice compared to most others and i dont have to work for it at all i just have a naturally very thin curvy structure but my face damn used to think i was pretty and now i dont even know how i came to that conclusion at like certain angles with a lot of makeup i think i look alright and maybe its because im not willing to shop my pics and im comparing myself to an impossible standard but still im severely depressed and anxious and having to deal with image issues on top of the rest of the self hatred this year has been tough though the good that comes from cosplay outweighs stuff like that i think i get compliments on social media but im always scared im the kind of weirdlooking/ugly that people feel like they have to overcompensate with
  its had a generally positive effect on me for sure i have pretty persistent acne and cosplay kinda got me to actually invest in skincare resulting in a nice boost to selfconfidence when i actually start looking better    its also gotten me to invest my time into the hobbies and skills with cosplay creation being moderately skilled at those things now is pretty reassuring and it always gives me a fuzzy feeling when a friend asks me for help with their wig or costume      this is why i approach cosplay as a casual hobby and never interact with the community outside of the constructive threads help/wip/wig general on /cgl/ its just fun to dress up as an anime at cons occasionally with accessories or clothes i made myself if youre trying your best and people have the gall to shit on you with nonconstructive or intrusive criticism then they can fight me
  your boobs literally have nothing to do with how good you are at putting together a good cosplay  did you mean you want to be patreonbucks famous
    guess what 90 of the cosplay tittyqueens like nigri have fake tits     so just get your own
   i know that a ton of cosplayers deal with hating their face i think that a lot of it comes down to comparing yourself towards the character/or people who shop their pics to look like that character you can get a similar body to a lot of anime/cartoon characters but getting a similar face to one is super tricky i would say that trying to emulate your character really well is more than an impossible standard especially without shop and being critical is also so so hard when youre trying to look like a fictional character when youre not i cant tell you how frustrated ive gotten because i couldnt make a garment look the way it was supposed to even though i knew that it wouldnt work 100 right in real life       it actually got me into skincare too i cringe when i think about the days where i would wash my face with a bar of soap now and it definitely feels great knowing that you can put your time to good use and have something that youre proud of     i definitely try to look at cosplay as a fun hobby too im not a professional by any means and just make a handful of costumes each year but im always hypercritical of everything i make and im trying to remind myself that its not a competition and even though im really shy and dont talk to that many people the best part about cosplay is going to cons for me too it makes me so happy whenever someone likes my cosplay enough to take a picture of it or when someone gets excited because im cosplaying a character that they really like this is a really good reminder that cosplay should be something you like doing instead of a stressful one
i used to feel confident starting out being overwhelmed by everything at conventions nowadays i tend to compare myself too much to others  im build like momokun and have been doing mostly simple costumes im losing weight right now and ive nearly gotten rid of my acne with accutane but i still dont like my nose jawline flat but wide ass ive always had self esteem issues and the only way people notice me is by dressing scantily / pretending to be confident
  why not make or buy a breast plate i have a flat chest but use one for big titty characters its a great way to get unrealistic cartoon proportions without having to have permanent surgery people know theyre fake because im 57 95lb but my breast plate has e cups when its that obvious nobody cares since its part of the character
i used to think i was super ugly and then started wearing makeup in my late teens then felt i was less ugly then i got into cosplay and learned a ton more about and started thinking i looked cute with falsies and a full face of makeup etc now its a few years later and im used to how i look with all that stuff and im back to feeling like im super ugly i dont even care that much about being unattractive i just wish i didnt always feel like people are lying when they tell me i look cute in my cosplays d
  i feel about the same in and out of cosplay not ugly but not dropdead gorgeous    i do feel better about the way i look now after ive put on a little weight used to be 54 and 110 at most and now im in the 125130ish i feel a little chubs now but i dont hate what i see in other peoples photos of me    cosplay makes me feel slightly more nitpicky about my appearance and thats not necessarily bad but i guess it does make me feel kinda eh when i feel like i want more attention for certain cosplays that i dont get if im not showing skin or being a sexy cosplay its all perspective though other peoples opinions shouldnt matter
  cosplay has really helped my self image to be honest i got back into cosplay my junior year of college and since then ive been working out more and more trying to do authentic cosplays has been the encouragement i needed to actually get off my ass only issue is i cant pull off the skinny anime cosplays like i used to
  honestly i hate myself so i cosplay so that i dont have be me for awhile its probably not healthy but i think its one of the things that helps keep me from blowing my brains out or drinking myself to death
  daaaaaaamn this is so relatable
cosplay has really helped me out in both self image and connections with companies ive always had connections with companies but cosplaying rally has been amazing experience for me ever since starting out used to work for companies in the background but now im at the forefront meeting new friends connecting with old ones etc that and being a personal trainer for many people helps out for the cosplays i do
it has made me objective and honest about it and im glad about that ive never felt need to say fat is beautiful or anything like that because its not i also realize that my face doesnt fit all types of characters and styles and thats fine
it made me work out a lot more consistently and most of the time my motivation for lifting is would i survive in x anime characters position also fitting into cosplays and being at least a little close to the original character feels good man like  said i got into anime and specifically sewing cosplay because its escapism as fuck lifting is just transferring said escapism to something thats a little more practical irl sewing is pretty useful to know anyways    its great until you hit a con and you see all the fats wearing skimpy partycity tier clothing and the betas orbiting them when you realize that it really doesnt matter its crushing to see how many photos get posted and liked of the shittiest hygiene makeup and shitty bought crumpled costumes that get posted because people have legit shit taste just makes me feel like shit or like my skills arent good enough yet so i guess its good motivation even so i know some fat thot can just wear mememe and outdo me due to cons being beta orbiter central    tldr mixed bag good personal motivation but shitty aftertaste after cons
  would i survive in x anime characters position    this you cant protect what you love unless you are strong
its positiveish for me i started working out a lot more lost weight improved my makeup skills etc but it hasnt really made me feel drastically better about myself im just in a constant state of wanting to git gud but not knowing how    one good thing is that being a cosplayer has helped me socialize better i was completely awkward before but having a buffer of mutually enjoying something helps me meet new people

if someone can please draw my basic ass coord id appreciate it
  here you go anon sorry the style doesnt allow for many of the pretty dress details
  its so cute thank you so much 
does anyone here still do lolita reaction image requests i know we had a thread a while back
  this is cute please get bracelets or wristcuffs tho
  i havent drawn much lately so i have very limited art supplies at the moment
  here you go
  i like you anon
  
  only the angle of the bonnet is off a quick edit could make the drawing look a lot better and her head not as big
  oh i love this thank you for posting this video
  i might go back to it to do more but just in case i dont
  where did you get that dress looks amazing
i would draw for this thread but i hate all you fat ugly whores posting in here
  projecting this hard  whatever you say fatty
  at least half of the people in these pictures would get shit on for being fat and ugly just a few years ago if you disagree youre probably one of them
  its ok we know you would be posting beautiful drawings if you werent such a phenomenally dreadful artist im sure people still appreciate you on the furry amino
  thank you
  for what its worth i think you have a cool face reminds me of glam rockers and hair metal and the nyd i think you could really kill a vk look
  this pose was fun hope you dont mind me simplifyng the print a bit    would love to see some more dynamic poses posted here
  yikes i dont know how the format got so butchered i hope this looks a bit better
  oh this is so cute thank you i love the addition of the baseball bat

i feel a little embarrassed asking for a drawing of me lol but there are so many talented artists here i loved all the drawings that have been posted so far 
  are you two really best friends if the photo is of one covering most of the other
  yes otherwise fat people couldnt have friends or only in the distance maybe noto implying girl in picture is fat

i feel a little self conscious posting my face but would anyone be willing to draw my favorite spank kei coord the lighting isnt the best i apologize
  i think this floordinate photo better shows the details and my hair is in an 80s style curly high ponytail if its hard to see in my pic
  girl i love your instagram aesthetic but please ditch those shoes and wear something in your hair youre so cute but so underwhelming
  youve got a point i really lack hair accessories this was a really rushed coord for a local con but one of the few times ive taken a photo of myself in a coord lmao  and i suppose its time to ditch the old trusty white high tops was thinking of getting some cute pastel sneakers
  its up to you i love your outfit pics and you have a really cute youthful face but those sneakers kill me a little not gonna lie
  i like the idea of white sneakers but my high tops are getting a little dingy lmao i feel you i think i struggle with finding cute footwear when it comes to spank kei and fk in general
  ur qt
  oh this is so cute thank you so much i love it
  inspired by your brooch
  your artstyle is so cute
  the little face squishing cat paw makes it
  oh my gosh  this is precious       do you guys have instagram or another site where i can properly give you credits 
  btw i made the brooch myself and wanted to go to that direction with the coord itself but run out of time and didnt get everything  like the madonna crown
  i may not be a gyaru but i fucking love this you are awesome never stop doing your thing
  god bless that cinnamoroll
  oh my god  omg this is so cute thank you so so so much

i would love to see someone draw this coord of mine
that was so fucking fast but im cracking up i understand wanting to reach out to other spiritual lolitas like that but theres no gift its a fucking religion/spiritual thing   t a lolita who practices forms of witchcraft
  what does this have to do with lolita do spirits help this girl with her coordinates i hope not
  this lolita witches are not unheard of but i would be interested to see if their lolita style bleeds into their craft like sweet lolitas with all rose quartz and pastel tarot gothic lolitas with animal skulls and tourmaline runes i think the concept is there but got trashed with the gift
i have a tarot deck am i a witch i can buy quartz
  i just peaked on this girls account and yikes why are all these so called witches always so unfortunate looking
    m a j i c     the real magic is in completing your gradeschool education
  ayrt it has nothing to do with it and white girl tumblr witches are cancer they dont know what theyre doing they kind of shoot out into the dark to find other people like them and end up being really loud and annoying in the process like honestly its like if a christian girl started shitting up rufflechat asking other lolitas are you christian how do you incorporate your christianity on your coord it just doesnt have anything to do with lolita and everything to do with the subculture and finding other people into like cultures       i would really love to see different witches or people from different religions try to put together themed coords with their religious or spiritual beliefs i mean outside of christianity because god knows we have too many cross prints i think it can be done tastefully but i feel like it could go south very fast i would like to see it happen tho
  all lolita witches i know got into it purely for the aesthetic so yeah im sure thats common
  i think its a meme one troll page was making fun of tumblr witches that dont want to use  magick because of connotations with crowley so they suggested using the worst form possible witches were too retarded to sense the sarcasm and ended up actually using it
every time i hear people referring to someone that is not a fictional character as a witch i cringe a little unless theyre wearing a costume or stuff like that obv
  wat
yall is it just me or is the op simply26
  its her lol
these goofballs are always fun im a pagan and an occasional ghost hunter but this majeek kristaaaahl bullshit needs to go and stay go
im thinking about replying with i went to hogwarts for 7 years
  tfw practice secular witchcraft and keep to myself try to frame everything within a tangible/scientific explanation before leaning on my beliefs and never mention it to anyone unless they specifically ask for information    cringelords like this and   are why i dont associate with other witches anymore too many fuckin tumblr girls who bought a quartz crystal once and think they have some chuuni ass powers now mixed with a healthy dose of fuckin schizo delusions i just wanna live a normal life i dont care if my beliefs are real or not as long as they bring me some comfort and stability
  the main issue is that these retards are using it as an identifier in order to make themselves stand out
  should someone tell them magick isnt real
  let the fairies believe what they want    something something pagan      what
  i snorted oh my god  the god warrior
  its a shame because it could be such a cool discussion if rufflechat op didnt include the part about the gift and people werent commenting about their special snowflake tumblr witchcraft id be interested in hearing what style people wear most  what they practice and seeing if theres any patterns ex if a lot of sweet lolitas tend to use tarot cards     classic lolita   meditates occasionally uses a pendulum does a lot of sage cleansing
the autism is in the post so strong
  im just so confused why would they post about witchcraft or any religion for that matter in a group about fashion
    because they probably still think of it as a costume and anybody who actually thinks they can feel spirits will be very into playacting and symbolist bullshit that only makes sense in their own mind
  to be fair sage burning does do a lot of good also makes yer house smell pretty lit i liken it to a feather duster where you make bad spirits feel uncomfortable because you keep tickling under their nose and they cant stop sneezing kinda like using a broom to usher a snake back out the door    attention more than likely   actually seems accurate
  i pray that rc gets a new shanice post soon
      who said tarot cards
  i think shes magic because its definitely a cursed thread
  i light a candle to her every night but it just isnt working
    cant make this shit up i know the spelling isnt the same but i guess its the same philosophy
can we all come back to reality now didnt realize this was roleplay group
  didnt realize this was roleplay group  most lolita groups on fb are full of people pretending to be lolitas cgl too honestly so while the groups themselves arent intended for roleplay they kind of are roleplay groups if were completely honest
this perfectly sums up op
im an old school sweet mainly with some old school goth lolita and i practice ceremonial magic/ work with grimoires but dont feel the need to put two and two together lolita is just clothes
  im getting the feeling that witchcraft is like kink in the sense that the moment its mentioned you all crawl out of the woodwork to say how you do xyz but you totally dont combine it with lolita
im glad this rc thread came up because now i know whos secretly crazy in my comm believing in occult shit is some deep level special snowflakery
  its different anon like we are getting a lot of secondhand embarrassment from people coming out and talking about this spiritual thing as if its real magic it makes us look bad and its not the same as kinksters at all lmao
yall in some crazy shit
  i place my queen of swords in defense mode your move pegasus     kek
  theres occult shit then what has been proven ghosts be real magic is not
  special snowflake  how many bets your comm wishes youd leave
    back to your luigi boards hags
  she thinks i believe in waluigi boards
  in honour of waluigi boards post your favourite themed coords
good thread
  freal though those things are whack you need a witch board
  i never thought i would get a good chance to post that great thread keep it up gulls
no scecrets today
  maybe the spirits told her to spam lj with feces
  using waluigi board  thats how you get ghosts in your burando closet skeptic anon    secrets are pretty much dead
  nayrt but it seems to me its exactly the same as people saying i wear lolita dresses with religious imagery but its not because im a catholic
  and how is it different from people into ddlg that come out to announce that they participate in it but they totally dont combine it with lolita unlike those other people its the same thing anon no one cares what your religion is and youre wasting your time coming here to announce whatever religion you practice to try to convince gulls that its not silly like people in the op make it out to be you care way too much about what randos on the internet think about your personal life
  shes right though
i came to apologize for the post i originally posted it wasnt to mock anyone or make myself look silly  i worded the post incorrectly i was genuinely interested if anyone else in lolita was into a certain lifestyle and merged it with their fashion  i couldnt explain it properly but in any case wanted to apologize for any wrong i made it looki never wanted to make any beliefs  religions or special gifts look silly in anyway or makeing it look like some kind of kink or fetish whatever that may be 
i too am a gothic lolita who collects bone parts of animal corpses and crystals takes pictures of them and reduces religions and bastardizes beliefs to pure aesthetics so all my tumblr friends think im edgy different and cool
  do yourself a favor and delete this before others read it nothing good will come from your post
  oh my god go away
i already deleted it but i can see me trying to just apologize and be cordual about the situation just agitates you more  guess you wanna make the situation worse by being rude twords me after trying to show i was being apologetic about it 
  literally stop youre only going to make things worse for yourself
literally stop youre only going to make things worse for yourself sure ok
  the new bmt do you also piss yourself
  bet your comm hates you too kohai
      crusader cords when
  muh jicc uwu
  making fun of tumblr witches  while using tumblr gif    ill to this day never understand how shittily compressed seconds of random tv shows and movies with captions became a staple of tumblr its shitty to look at almost never properly coveys what the poster means and seems like it takes more work to make than just making a regular fucking reaction image with a still like what the fuck does this animation convey to me
  oh anon i would drop this now before you end up in the mess of petty drama and salt that is cgl when you defend yourself like this
  because religion isnt a kink one results in sexual harassment and the other results in secondhand embarrassment pls explain
  kek  that was such a good episode
  youve never seen the god warrior shes a classic american tv lunatic
  new  oh sweet summer child youre in for a ride shes been at it for years look up the simply26 tag on getoffegl
is it safe to buy from raines shes got so many things up for sale its bizarre does she live in one big storage container
  im not saying religion is a kink lol please read my post again im saying that these people are like kinksters in how the moment their religion is mentioned in this context they crawl out of their corners of the internet to say how theyre totally different and not cringey similarly to what kinksters do when some ddlg asshole makes them look bad
  scalper and dont list every deffect but overhall ok
  okay thanks shes listing my dream dress and im not sure whether to get it ill compare prices of previously sold ones
  she buys cheap brand resells it but to be perfectly honest her dress prices are no more expensive then other european sellers and if youre a european buyer you can avoid the high shipping and customs as well as shopping service fees so its not all terrible
  11/9    never forget
  sister has visions of plane crash   this is a year before   doesnt mention it   11/9 happens   she has the gift
  yeah im uk so i try to never buy from outside europe due to fees high shipping and also especially now the exchange rate
  pendulums are so cool ive always wanted to learn more about dowsing     also  kuro sweet  meditate chaos magic i celebrate the witches sabbaths for fun im not at all a believer but i really enjoy taking a day to celebrate nature and the passage of time and the sabbats work well for that for the autumn equinox i went to a prairie collected some sunflowers and made a cute pie
reposted because i missed a name  anyone catch the initial shot show
  substyle  sweet and classic  witchcraft and other hoodoo  no
  is this a deck  i would totally buy this
  i saw that idk what shes even talking about but its like this girl made the whole group so she could whine
  are you like 10 or something this was a thing long before tumblr retard
  are you 10 because they werent theyre shittily compressed particularly because of tumblrs limitations you never got short 35 second looped gifs of piss quality of random shows with subtitles before tumblr closest you got were anime reaction stills with subtitles primarily because most people watched them with subtitles and just pressed the screenshot hotkey to easily repost the trend of taking a random few seconds of a series almost always live action series compressing it to absolute shit and adding subtitles to it started with tumblr as reblog fuel
  i have to agree  you miiight be able to make an argument it was prevalent on ontd but im pretty sure it was tumblr first
  this is some serious autism calm down
  yeah you must be retarded if you took the time to justify your believing that horse shit how are you even this pissy over the use of a gif thats completely relevant to the ops post
not sure how to feel about this one
  reason for selling wedding cancelled  oof that aside still a normie being retarded and shilling their shit in the wrong place
  my question is how the fuck they even find the lolita sales group in the first place do they just search sales and click through pages of unrelated groups and go oh this is a good place to sell this after a 2 second glance lolita isnt particularly a term that most people would throw in the search box
  i was wondering the same the bodyline sales group is especially full of people selling really random items like machines
  i agree with this rufflechat is so fucking boring ive seen the same questions over and over like how do you deal with harassing comments or what do you think of the book lolita/some bait regarding lolita and its neverending    id much rather see discussion tangentially related to lolita like this more occult things can be related to gothic lolita just like classical literature could be related to classic lolitas japanese pop culture for sweet etc i really feel like lolita has no substance or depth to it because people just laugh at stuff like this and continue to talk about ageplay and fetishes and peoples opinion on it over and over i think the latter is the cringe
    probably instagram normies that occasionally see lolita tagged posts that arent even lolita and assume any highly feminine dress falls under that category due to their only exposure to the term being mistagged instathot shit
  this reminds me a tripfag on /x/ who does tarot readings is a lolita she sperged out at me for posting a drawing of menherachan once kek
  on one hand oof  but on the other its not a fucking lolita dress
  i like how shes apparently spamming the fairy kei group too i get that it sucks youre out 140 but thats not really our problem and people telling you this isnt an appropriate place to sell something is hardly flaming you
  which
  caps
  i think its gone now either it got removed or she deleted it i did tell her it wasnt any form of jfashion so it didnt belong in the fairy kei group either
    misfire sorry and sorry no caps
  naryt  i feel you on your first point but i also feel like your second point conflicts with it because the question how do you incorporate ___ religion into your coord is literally how the different religious themed coords would come about if you wanted to see them conversation is necessary to make things happen    ive had to distance myself from some friends that got too into witchcraft because im pretty sure they didnt know what they were messing with and my superstitious ass is too scared to chance it i wont even touch those ouija board charms or dresses also our mutual friend that dragged them into the whole thing was pretty sketchy to begin with trying to befriend spirits all the time and whether or not that shit is real it made us feel like something not good was around people mess with too much for the sake of novelty
  how i feel tbqhfamalam  i personally am pretty turned off by occult and witchcraft anything browsing taobao and jfash has been a tough challenge with the trend of goatheaded deities pentagram straps and inverted crossesnot into these themes assaulting my eyes all the time2dark4me
  alright a few things  block out the names so you dont get banned  what the fuck is going on in vt    based on this and some other comm drama ive been eavesdropping in on their mod seems like a newbie whos trying way too hard
  i wonder who that could be  perfectly describes galacticbutthole chan/hwc
  i am amused of how the people who or going against the mod are also notorious itas   i am so done with all those beginners who are trying to go against the critique of the more experienced lolitas because uwu bullying elitist having them gone is nothing but a good riddance i cant remember if its the sewing chat or the alternative sewing chat but it is also a shitfest of ita thats cant handle concrit why cant people just accept that some things arent and cant be lolita learn from your mistakes and be open for concrit going against it and taking the victim role has never worked and often only makes things worse
  its because theyre small children who have never been told no or at least have he minds of small children that have never been told no
  unfortunately it cant always been blamed on them being young but they do most certainly all have the mindset of a spoiled 6year old brat
  i saw this shit live
  im pretty sure they didnt know what they were messing with and my superstitious ass is too scared to chance it i wont even touch those ouija board charms or dresses  haha oh god  you sound like those larpers on /x/
  88 i think id seen her get into a fair share of arguments but that was the only time i ever knowingly interacted with her
  there was another post of the vt comm and someone commented about everyone needing improvement and that one girl went off on the commenter i think its been deleted though
  i mean i dont care either way but whatever
  hey thats my husband
  i like to use a weggy board
  cordual  its cordial you ass
  of all the mistakes in that post you go after the one that was probably just a sausagefinger typo
  sausagefinger typo  since when is that forgivable do you even know what site youre on    notice how im not using question marks those were rhetorical questions thought id explain since you dont seem all that bright
this chick green is insane after posting a pic of her coord in alt fashion amino she went on to say that the lolita amino mods were grumpy
  what the actual fuck
  i didnt even know vt had a comm how embarrassing
  this is the same idiot who goes by it/its and says theyve been wearing lolita since 1995
reposting with edits because this needs to be put on display    some unecessary pot stirring from a bunch of 12 year olds who cant dress themselves decided to pick a fight and shit talk in a public chat green is actually 12 and said to her friends in the vermont chat imma post my dress i made and see what happens she asked for concrit and beginner chat gave her fairly nice advice vermont chat started spouting what bitches your dress was great why cant they say anything nice it was a black and white striped collar 2 piece normie skirt and sleeveless shirt with red ribbon hand sewn into it red joined the beginner chat called a mod a meanie for not praising the dress and not posting it on the fridge red gets removed from the chat and the rest of the vermont public chat forgets its a public chat that mods can see mods strike shit stirriers green and red and remind the chat that its public and that if they have a problem with moderation to speak to them directly they throw a hissy fit get mad and say mods are spying on us and create a brand new asspat amino called friendly lolitas     tldr shit stirring vermont lolitas do a experiment in another chat with mods in it by asking for crit they received crit and got offended shit talked others in a public chat and act surprised that they got in trouble and their chat disabled
  yep its 
    the mods are meanies to children and thats bad  i dont mean to condescend but youre like 13 and not prepared to have this conversation lol      right
  i neeeeeed this to be real
  ghosts and spirits arent real
  elbows are lewd and short sleeves are illegal
  indigo child  ok that says everything       seriously the stupid witch trend thats sweeping all over instagram right now annoys me to no end the worst is when people i like for their coords and who seemed sensible and educated jump on that band wagon as well and now claim to be able to talk to demons and do astral projection and shit that shit is no better than hearing angel voices and thinking jesus guides your every move   why cant it be cool to be solidly based in reality and believe in science please
  the parasitic twin comment was maybe even cringyer than op tho 
  sooo which is it should children in this case a 12 year old be given a free pass or should they be talked down to and treated like retards
  children that young should probably stay out of the fashion until theyre older in all honesty
  agreed i personally dont think you should be in this fashion until 15/16 when you can make money at some minimum wage job to spend on fun things most younger are too underdeveloped emotionally or mentally to understand income spendature or concrit
  i agree but desu it wasnt a serious question just pointing out the person in the screenshots hypocrisy
  i respect your choice to distance yourself from shady people anon but ouija boards are literally parlour games theyre no more mystical than a game of cluedo and theres nothing to be spooked about
  are 15/16 year olds in minimum wage jobs anymore that seems like an outdated concept now i feel as if i never see anyone younger than 20 in service jobs now     i was 12 when i got into lolita and i remember back then being told to walk to the bank myself and open my own bank account so i could afford my own lolita clothes obviously it was genius advice
  where do you live that allows 12 year olds to open their own bank accounts
  im in my 20s and have been working since i was 16 you can work anything that isnt food alcohol or heavy machinery afaik
  i assume they had a joint account with their parent i had my account since birth with my parents its how they gave me an allowance automatically from their paycheck
  i live in the uk and i have had a bank account since i was 12 its fairly normal    most 15/16 year olds have to go to school full time and have limit on how many hours they can work in term time in the uk i dont blame companies for not wanting to hire them its hard to find some work if you dont have nepotism to help you at that age
  im from the states i never said i was able to open my own bank account that was just the advice given to me by egl circa 2008       i never said 16 year olds cant work i just personally dont think its common as people think it is in 2018
    be as brutal as you would be with an adult make them cry only then they will learn      this photo offends my eyes
when i was 16 about 3 or so years ago about 80 of my year worked uk do its definitely not as uncommon as you think either probably depends on where they live too and if your parents are better off then you probably dont need to work either
  you can work in food at 16  t done that    but either way i personally wouldnt be comfortable with a 16 year old in my comm had to deny young teens from joining and im glad i did  my comm tends to vy towards more mature themed meets
  i was working 50 hours a week over the summer when i was 15 legal loophole that let me get a state equivalent of a ged before 16 certainly made more than enough to buy brand if id been a lolita back then
  i getcha i mean there used to be an egl sub_group for people who wore lolita and are a part of a religious/spiritual practice honestly probably didnt help that it was simply26 posting sad she hasnt really changed
as a poc this shit makes me real fucking uncomfortable when eurofag white bitches throw up a stink about how all non whites are so oppressed and its their duty to lift us up and support our businesslike fuck i buy cool stuff that i like if its nice and worth my money and run by poc cool but im not going to blow money just because its poc owned
  throw up a stink about how all non whites are so oppressed and its their duty to lift us up and support our business  as another poc theyre not even doing that its usually poc more specifically black creators who push for supporting black businesses theyre just repeating what they hear    at worst theyre just virtue signalling which is cringy and annoying but it doesnt make me real fucking uncomfortable
    im black and this seems like a really awkward way to push this message to put it lightly like its dumb to try and guilt people into putting their black friday spending money into poc indie brands doing this will not do a thing to support poc on a whole or alleviate oppression i dont use this phrase often but this is one of the clearest examples of empty virtue signaling ive seen     i like to buy from black owned brands but i dont make a big stink about it if i find a brand i really like and they happen to be black owned then i feel pretty happy about that but i dont go out of my way to like try to guilt people into buying from them thats too much man
  are you me anon
  was just coming here to post this sorry ill chuck my money wherever is making products i want whatever skin colour or gender the person selling it is if you want me to buy from poc women link some that make nice stuff dont just throw round this wishy washy virtue shit
bitch is really trying to say shes wearing the same dress when its obvious not
  this bitch likes the complain about the community while posting shit like this and going on tv as a living doll
  butasiansarepoc
  laughing so hard did she really think people would buy that its the same dress im not sure why she decided to post that pic on cof its not even a good pic the only thing you can see is that shes not in lolitai hope mods remove her pic from cof because they did remove pics 100 times better than this one it doesnt deserve to stay on cof
  looks like normal sleep wear that you would find in a target i honestly never understand wearing fairykei in places that arent appropriate like the chick that showed up for a discounted lesson in bright pink and white fairy kei a firearms lesson with carbon and oil and brass
  that sounds so unbelievably stupid like if im baking bread or whatever or cleaning or idk doing something that has the possibility of getting anything on my clothes i wear an apron or change into something else even for normie fashion now imagine something that is expensive like lolita or fairy kei
  yeah it was taxing i kept having to baby sit her outfit and even then she kept wiping her hands on her pants if you can call them that after loading mags when you load mags oil and brass shavings build up on your thumb imagine smearing that concoction across your expensive clothes when that shit can stain blue jeans
  im okay with fairy kei but not on cof lol and even if it was fairy kei it wouldnt be a great outfit
  cof has always been strictly lolita so im a little confused why it was allowed to be posted anyway
  i genuinely reeed at that
  its fine i always teach lolitas defensive shooting for free and the good stories outweigh the bad the thought of that one girl using a leg holster still tickles me to this day  ill just wear a leg holster its fine  under the petticoat
  do posts have to get approved before showing on the group i thought the moderation was after they get posted im sure theyll remover her post anyway its way too ot
  i thought posts had to be approved i may be wrong
  theyre not but they should be
  i think the post is already gone cant find it anymore on cof
  yup its gone
    fucking this thank you the definition of poc literally means anyone who isnt white
  there are a ton of black and brown people who would disagree with you im not saying theyre correct just that the distinction is finer than white/notwhite to a lot of notwhite people east asians are light skinned and tend to benefit from model minority stereotyping so a lot of particularly black and darker skinned brown people categorize them outside of people of color     obviously this sounds like complete nonsense to east asians and to whites who have a basic grasp of how racism but not colorism works but i recommend that if youre white you just accept that this terminology is a in flux and b not your lane to define
  thank you for providing nuance based anon
  completely disregarding the message in this post that skirt actually does look pretty nice
  east asians are light skinned  i know several countries worth of inhabitants that would disagree with this overgeneralization
    exactly everyone forgets about the darker skinned asians some of us get the same shit as the rest of you dont forget there are lighter skinned hispanics that can pass for caucasian too theres pretty much range from light to dark skinned amongst the minorities
    youre the guy who recruits us when you need numbers for your race rallies then completely fucks is over with your race division issues     fuck you
  what the fuck isit you even want you beg for whities to support us support or causes and our businesses but shit all over them when they actually do it because now you have nothing valid to actually demand from them or you do it because they arent doing it exactly how you picture them doing it in your own warped mind     nothing about this makes me uncomfortable and you probably arent either quit making mountains out of molehills
    support poc women   coordinate has more white creators than doing a lolita coordinate with traditional brands     not to mention even big lolita brands tend to operate on smaller scale than typical fast fashion this should be acknowledged but shes kind of dumb and trend hoppy so this is what happens i guess
  she did word it as support poc women i dont know about you but to me that suggests support women but especially try and support women of color
  ive been working since i was 14 paper rounds retail been in the food industry since i was 16 its not that uncommon
  please stop derailing this thread with job talk
anyone else getting im not like other girls vibes from this  most lolitas have bought from bodyline and its basically dead now plus with the secondhand market you dont need to buy from bodyline anymore
  plus with the secondhand market you dont need to buy from bodyline anymore    you cant get a decent blouse for 15usd shipped from the second hand market but you can consistently with bl
  why settle for decent when you can invest just a bit more money and get solid quality and design quality does matter in this fashion you know unless youre a fan of cheap polyester i suppose
  why is the implication in your post that pocowned is necessarily exclusive from nice/good you seem to be taking things the wrong way shes trying to do good are you really a poc or some racist white anon trying to dissuade fellow huwhites from supporting us ungrateful nonwhites  there are literal nazis running around and committing killing sprees the kkk has marched through neighborhoods in america with police protection and young white men are being fed propaganda to make them depressed belligerent and violent at this very minute this is the least of our problems it may be virtue signalling but at least its not more hateful bs shes trying to help   like i swear everything white people do is wrong to some of you do or say nothing theyre ignorant and complacent with racism do or say something virtue signalling god
  bl isnt decent dont be stupid
  because the price/quality ratio is better for bl than it is for brand 15usd new decent bl blouse vs 50usd seconhand brand blouse vs 100usd new brand blouse lets say decent is 3 out of 5 while brand is 5 out of 5 stars and im not taking into consideration that affordable brand is used and as such its condition is worse then we have 15/3 50/5 and 100/5 bl still has the lowest price/quality ratio 5 brand has 10 or even more if it is bought new lets say you think bl is worse than 3 out of 5 2 out of 5 then bl still wins 15/2 is 75 which is lower than 10 used brand this is just an example but i hope you understand what i mean     that said i do agree that brand has superior quality and it is worth investing into it however i dont think that wearing brand means you cant own any bl and vice versa personally i dont have a job and prefer to buy less expensive blouses and more expensive dresses when i have more money i will definitely buy brand blouses as well because i do love them     im not getting into the argument bodyline is shit you poorfag because its not worth my time
  i just scrolled through and its amazing bodyline looks as cheap and costumey as it did back in 2014
  50usd seconhand brand blouse  being this incompetent at secondhand shopping  there are brand blouses and cutsews for 30 and less most of them are in fantastic condition and unlike bodyline blouses they feel like actual wearable garments rather than costume pieces youre trying way too hard to justify yourself
  there are brand blouses and cutsews for 30 and less  30usd shipped  ss price in decent condition i highly doubt they are common also we were talking about blouses not cutsews and im not trying to justify anything stop being so aggressive
    i guess i am incohmpetent too because i have been looking for a cheap secondahnd blouse for a while now and i have never found one i liked for 30usd i mean with shipping included you live in a country near to japan maybe and shipping is cheap
  nayrt but i think where you live deeply affects how cheap a blouse and everything else is i was talking about buying secondhand from japan without living there of course if you live in america or brasil or some other country where the secondhand market is super active you will be able to find blouses for cheap there are maybe 10 girls in total who sell secondhand lolita in my country and the only one who is constant is a scalper customs are also a pain above 22euros you have to pay 1/4 of the total price so please  go ahead and tell me that i am incompetent for not finding blouses at 30usd shipped lol
  lurking through random profiles came across this and found it appropriate
im just so confused on why youd alter a dress into an over dress
    i regret searching for the original its also pretty shitty most actual grown adults know people who prefer tea coffee cocoa all of them none of them two of them soda people wateronly drinkers alcoholics sugarholics and whatever other permutation the serious tea drinkers are always people who appreciate what goes into a good cup of coffee and the serious coffee people can appreciate a good cup of tea even if they prefer cocoa after coffee this idiotic comic seems to be drawn by a child who has maybe met two people in their entire lives and needs to make dumb drawings of their limited life experiences    so far as lolita goes its a bad fit anyway for lolita the lines arent even drawn as brand fans vs hipsters vs bodyline its more like brand fans vs western indie supporters vs korean/jp supporters vs taobao brand fans vs bodyline fans vs amazon gift card shoppers vs clueless normies wearing dresses for the first time vs someone who found the tag on insta and has no clue what it means and thats already glossing over taobao brand fan vs casual taobao shopper     none of this works at all the word indie being thrown around here doesnt even mean anything what exactly does the brand fan think is disgusting bodyline is useful as its hardy taobao quality isnt up to par but not completely trash the only thing thats actually referred to as disgusting is replicas where does indies even fit into that and what indie supporter says its something real adults need to do they want you to support indie because its good not because real adults wtf and were ignoring how even the bodyline supporters fully acknowledge the bodyline shop is half filled with ita magnets and crap mixed in with the actually decent dresses    tldr  this is a shit comic and an even shittier edit and i honestly regret even bothering to look up any of this
  judging the photo its because the dress didnt fit her
    forgot to attach the original
  i think i just found my spirit animal
  poor dress
    man i forgot how much i hate tumblr rosacea noses
  answering a question   derailing  nayrt but really
  lets be real bodyline isnt decent its a 1 it passes a quick glance but looks like cheap plastic because it is but the poor only step on the poor because they cant budget for quality
  i mean even with a normie wardrobe you have pieces of varying prices for varying purposes i aint wearing my more expensive work clothes to go apple picking though if i was filthy rich maybe i would     bodyline is the lolita equivalent of the cheap tee you wear when you know youre going to do a more unsafe for clothing activity
  not even that man i m o i cant even wear bodyline for grungy shit anymore its just too uncomfortable and i hate hearing my clothes crunch when they move i threw out and sold my old bl years ago and i could never recommend them even as a cheap option because they are so shitty and itchy
  they are seriously the crunchiest fucking clothes ive ever owned i didnt know fabric could be so unpleasant until i picked up a cheapo bl blouse at a swap meet out of necessity
    i feel this i bough a 1 parka cutsew and it was so stiff i dont know how tf they managed to make a cutsew stiff the lace gave me a fucking rashtoo tossed it out after a few hours
can kids please stop coming to this fashion
  compared to some of the shit coming out of taobao its great at least with bl you get can a decent sweet look some of the shit on tb sold as lolita is not lolita cosplay wigs/ ita bait dresses and it confuses noobs
  i get what nonny is saying if you buy secondhand only from ww and cc blouses and accessories arent cheap
  if im honest i expected it to be much worse after reading that
      as a newbie i did a bunch of research to figure out what bls top 3 blouses were and bought them all plus a skirt a jsk and some accessories then immediately regretted it and resold everything the fabric was crunchy the lace itchy the ribbons insanely shiny and i felt like i just bought cosplay components instead of clothes this was before i ever owned lolita brand pieces but id had plenty of experience with normie brands and even when comparing to the cheap stuff it was night and day to be honest i dont understand why anyone recommends bodyline to people who can fit secondhand brand and im annoyed with myself for listening to them
  yeah im wearing the cheap secondhand cutsews i have why would i deliberately wear something uncomfortable and poor quality
  honestly this if youre 1618 but can dress well and have money ill let it slide two members of my comm joined at 16 and damn well dressed themselves fine now theyre 18 and doing just fine but this dude go join the cesspool that is cosplay
  it must be the style you wear i have two bodyline oldschool blouses with cotton lace and like them better than my actual brand blouses i have one of the more modern chiffon blouses and its fine too the net lace on the wristcuffs i got is so scratchy i cant wear them though
  agreed there are some in that age range on amino who dress well and work and save for lolita and i really commend them for their work but then you get the children who cry their parents wont buy things for them because of shipping or whine they only work 5 hours a week and cant save up for lolita but somehow think theyre entitled to the fashion
  imagine being proud you shop from a company run by a creepy man who shipped young girls to japan just to try to marry them a company of low quality items that has sold replicas in the pasta company that sells sex stuff alongside lolita and is looked down upon by the japanese community imagine not only supporting a company like that but being proud of it
killjoy in lolita humor
  they were two oldschool cotton blouses with cotton lace and a shirred polyester blouse the cotton blouses felt like they were made of paper
  not laundering the cotton blouses to remove the sizing
  they were still crunchy after i washed them why is it so hard to believe that a cosplay company uses low quality materials
  i own 34 bodyline dresses and 1015 japanese brand dresses i dont think bodyline is bad quality at all i might have bought the okay items because i read tons of reviews before buying i will always recommend discounted bodyline to newbies
  this i own a chiffon blouse and man is the material uncomfortable even after 3 washes its passable but id rather wear my nice brand blouses
  this girl comes across as a huge lolita know it all even though ive never seen a coordinate shes done
  have you not seen any of her posts on cof
  you know something i hadnt thats so weird
  its not a bad coord by any means but wew lass that fucking plastic wig
  she has the face of a snobby knowitall
    on one hand i want to excuse it as theyre just kids especially for the kids that are 1314 but on the other hand there are lolitas who are 1618 who get jobs save up and buy brand themselves myself included     i guess some very spoiled 1314 year olds havent quite figured out how the world works yet and think that mommy and daddy not buying them 200 dresses is the end of the world at the end of the day that mentality really is just because theyre spoiled brats who are getting their first taste of the world not revolving around them
  oh hey im the exact same way you seem cool we should hang out 
  hope yr 18 or else get ready for that ban little lady
  inb4 whiteknighting i dont even know her personally but i meanshe does know a lot more than most of the community about this fashion and she is a major contributor in it so if she comes off as a know it all it is probably because she does know a fucking lot  but yeah that post is a killjoy i guess
  i bought a bodyline op where someone had sewn lace on the bottom and around the arm holes and changed the plain pointed officelooking collar into a lace edged peter pan collar i had never seen the stock photo and when i did i was amazed at how bad it originally was before the previous owner saw its potential and altered it bodyline dont have the worst materials and their construction is solid but even after so many years they make so many basic mistakes when it comes to their lolita designs these mistakes are the sort of things that a noob might easily miss but are obvious to anyone with a shred of experience for this reason i would not recommend bodyline to a new lolita
why are people so quick to defend sissies
  well under thelema magick is just willpower so it depends on which esoteric shit youre into as someone who keeps their occult interest pretty lowkey this rc post was so cringe its like any religion keep it to yourself and dont shove it in peoples faces
  this must be ms herself
  so now theyre taking their gripes to the alt fash amino apparently
  its disgusting how entitled these brats can be one girl is roughly 18 and cries about her family being too poor to afford any lolita and got upset her mom wouldnt do a preorder for her these kids are also deadset on coming out as a lolita and feel a need to explain the fashion to make their parent accept it when really they can just wait until they have a job and buy it with their own money    maybe im just old but when i was a kid you didnt ask mom for 200 dresses let alone throw a fit you didnt get a material item and you didnt try to convince that no into a yes unless you wanted a beating lmao
  inside job type thing going on  xfiles theme plays in the background
  my cousin who is only 3 years younger than me would demand her parents give her 100 every time she went shopping which was every day in the summertime she also threw her perfectly good iphone in water to ruin it just because she wanted the newest model shes in her mid twenties now so its something our generation did too our parents just raised us to be respectful and not entitled little shits
  im in my early 20s now        i know womenchildren who are my age who are spoiled beyond belief   the most spoiled one i know has all of her living expenses paid for by her parents while she spends every dollar she makes from her job on cosplay and clothes she literally has no savings and is a hoarder but neither she nor her parents see any problem with this     this really isnt a generational thing its more about how you were raised and how lenient your parents are
  the loluminati  this is all just one giant lord of the flies social experiment youre all taking part in
  ayrt it just really amazes me because i dont know anyone my age who is like this but it may just be the people i surround myself withwere all midtwenties and have had to work for everything we have now i do also live in a heavy military area and boi the entitlement ill see from grown women in their 30s is akin to these children so maybe it is just a lifestyle difference but i always chalked it up to age
  bless u
  please put a bow on it
  what i hope not
  hows this
  this is perfect
this is what i like to see
  poodlecorp
  also in this chat two faced unknown a is complaining about being unfairly banned when shes currently in the vermont chats second amino talking shit also in cap is h another vermont shit stirrer talking about how shes made another account to continue vermont lolitas need to reevaluate their idea of friendly lolitas amino if theyre all being assholes    friendly lolitas  kek  misspelt lolitas  double kek
  loluminati confirmed
  well now we know why this chick was banned all of them are two faced assholes who cant handle critisim or their own unchecked attitudes
this post gives me nostalgia
  back at it again with the godawful taste
  god this chick is annoying there are other dresses out there
  also 4l it makes sense she cant find it the only lolitas that would buy this are all fattychans
  god is she even a lolita all she ever does is bitch and be passive aggressive on rc why are uggo fatties so entitled
  does she post often i blocked her a while back
  i havent really paid much attention to rc as of late but in the past she would bawww over not fitting into brand or affording it and then when people would point out that some brands could fit her planet ass she would go silent
    tfw i knew exactly what item she was talking about when she mentioned navy blue cape and green plaid
  how can someones taste be this bad there are lots of brand dresses on lm literally for 50150 and she wants this pos
  that apostrophe
  i have purchased brand new without tags blouses for 1530 dollars on lm a couple had some sort of makeup stain from trying on or something that was easily removed with a wash i also jsut got a couple bodyline blouses for 12 dollars each and while they arent horrible they are definitely not anything i want to wear so ill probably sell them
  sage but holy christ stop with the nonny shit youre as bad as the lordy loo girl
  tbh i dont mind if lolitas are too stupid to figure out shopping services and hunt for good deals they can keep buying poor quality bodyline dont need to justify it more brand for me      this art style is hideous and it reads as the artist trying to be special and unique i hate tea and coffee and have never once gotten shit for it and most tea/coffee drinkers like both
  murdered by words
  iconic
  which group is this in lmao
  she doesnt sound sane
      looks like a lame troll
uk sales comm strikes again with brexit approaching we need at least some good stuff to buy since buying abroad will be extremely expensive more so than right now
  lol i said it once itt and its slang people sometimes use here wtf is your damage
  88 lbs
  do they sell thanksgiving themed quilting cotton in the uk that seems counterintuitive
  it that what it is i always just thought of that pattern as hideous 80s american pattern
  people can order shit online you know lol
  maybe shes really really short and has fat instead of muscle fat takes up more space but weigths less than muscle or maybe shes a liar lol
  well sure but why    yeah the pumpkins and cornucopia are a giveaway
    op draw lolita  users reply back saying it isnt lolita  op replies with this is lolita ive looked at lolita dress so this is lolita
  woah brings me back to my weeby babbylita days i used to draw stuff like this thinking it was lolita
  idk i got an aatp romeo blouse two weeks ago for 1000 yen 300 commission and 500 shipping    the issue is mainly that people dont have the patience to learn how to shop secondhand or what to search let alone wait for good deals all the better for the rest of us when we fight over a 3500 yen roland or 9000 yen holy lantern i guess
  r/lolita is a shitshow in general even without ita drawings for example this was posted to r/lolita just because op ripped the front off an aatp bag to attach to a tacky jacket 
  i follow him on facebook as some of his outfits are quite nice this however is not
today was the first day of exhibition and some pics have already appeared what do you think gulls is this the future ott fans want
dumping some photos
    maybe theyre just unflattering photos but these literally look costumetier like the pricier costumes youd find at party city or whatever
  this is not a cute dress the appliques look really cheap and the bows should have been made out of the same velvet as the lace up detail
  end of dump the fact they put honey cake on display  made a post card with it gives hope
      raschel lace
  agreed
  imagine being so dumb you cant tell apart different quality lace and shouting raschel lace every time you see this lace design  you do realize there is such a thing like high quality thick and soft raschel lace that is being used in bridal dresses all the time
  just because its thick and soft doesnt mean that it doesnt look tacky and cheap as hell
  this
  complaining about pretty nice looking raschel lace  not this godawful fur    this
  it only looks tacky to you because youve been conditioning yourself to looks like raschel lace raschel lace bad  there are so many lolitas who dont know shit about quality materials so they just spout the stuff they learned when they got into lolita
  damn i thought this was the prima donna collab that was lost to time
dang definitely wish i was in tokyo right now to see this in person this looks pretty cool although i suspect were not seeing even half the stuff thats on display theres apparently like a ton of posters and postcards on the walls plus whatever is in the background of  could be a seperate shop or part of the museum then theres a bunch of dresses in the background of  and then none of them are the same dresses in  its hard to tell if its the same wall or a different one or just one really long wall who knows how many dresses are actually up there that this person couldnt get away with photographing    looks like whoever took the photographs zoomed in on the runway dresses makes a lot of sense these are versions of dresses you normally wouldnt see up close even if you attended the tea parties youd generally still be viewing the dress at a distance    i wouldnt really worry about the materials  since these are the runway versions i wouldnt be surprised if they chose certain items because they knew it would look good on the runway as their top priority it wouldnt be the first time they use different materials for the regular release although to be honest im still really salty castle mirage does not actually come in ouji style    nice to see that candy dress in  though thats a throwback to like 2006 i would rather be looking at the runway memorial cake i wonder if that also made it into the museum or they decided it wasnt relevant anymore i think in general i would have loved to see even older dresses with their older label but maybe they dont even have those around anymore
  i think it looks fine on        but theres too many different kinds on    its a clusterfuck
  look like those toilet roll cover dolls
  thinking about going there tomorrow idk how crowded it will be though i personally miss the pastel vomit era of 20102012
99 of it looks like pricy costumes god i hate ott
these pictures are making me feel ok about not going not interested in 9/10 of these
  the fabric on this is gorgeous i hope they use it in something thats more toned down
  personally miss the pastel vomit era of 20102012  i really agree with you there these pictures dont even feel like lolita to me its kind of depressing maybe im just being a salty nostalgic oldfag but this just doesnt give me the same feelings as the lolita fashion i know and love
  depending on how much of honeycake they rereleased if it happened id be willing to spend up to 1000 on it id get 2 colorways for sure and the bag and accessories if the were available
  there is a whole row of nonott stuff with iconic dresses
  this is beautiful
  did you not see the picture with sc and honey cake
  fruits parlor op in mint  my heart
  i considered getting this bag but the only dress it wouldve fit was my cinema doll in lav glad to see its not fitting after all
  aw i dont wear sweet but this dress always has a place in my heart
  fruits parlor   now thats what im talkin about
  ah yes thank youits already better  im happy to see they incorporated prints from earlier years as well
  i hate ott but that fluffy dress with the cage its so angelic pun not intended
  the future  anon the name of this event is angelic pretty museum these are all _past_ fashion show and archive pieces
  i think they meant the museum not new releases
whoever is finding and dumping all the new images thank you so much for your hard work                all that raw burando fabric    holy shit this is my younger selfs dream
man i just really hate ott
  same its too much and looks tacky if anyone wore this to an event id probably laugh having said that i dont know whether these are concept pieces or just to showcase the talent of the designers so im not mad about it
  these ott pieces were never supposed to be worn as an outfit they are supposed to be fun for the designers o go all out and see what they can do the customers of these dresses buy them as collectors pieces to showcase them and maybe do one photoshoot
dump curiosity of aoki1i1i on instagram
  /dump
  tacky and cheap  this fucking tired ass meme no one here has any other descriptors
  my first brand print and a pony bag to boot so nostalgic i love ap
  ap better rerelease this too
kind of surprised to not see a single true old school dress though i would have loved to see the full evolution but i wonder if thats because they feel that they really defined the brand in the print era i feel like if baby had a museum they would totally put a lot of old school in there
  ah right that makes more sense i figured they were more sort of concepts rather than wearable outfits   the honey cake coord is cute as fuck though
  but theyre not wrong the sky is blue raschel lace looks cheap
  i think so too oldschool ap was gorgeous but its so different from modern ap they probably left it out on purpose to keep the museum more cohesive to their modern brand image i really wanna see a meta museum full of their craziest creations
  oldschool ap isnt that recognizable you dont look at it and think ah angelic pretty unless you are a big fan of old school and very familiar with their dresses from that time
  fuck yes meta museum when
  whats the name of this apron
  or maybe when they were a smaller brand that just got started they didnt keep one of each release i wouldnt see a startup brand with less profit margins keep past designs they could have sold just for the sake of it
  you say that but then chinese girls wear them to disneyland with unkempt hair and sneakers
  mermaid symphony  seeing this makes me regret selling my mint op so much nostalgia
  cursed image
    oh jesus what the fuck
  man i just really wanna fuck honey cake so badly why cant ap rerelease you i love you baby please call me some time
  not any of those anons obviously but i freaking love raschel lace of quality meta has some amazing raschel lace on some of their dresses and before i actually had it in person i kinda thought it looked a bit bad before but its amazing and now i love it so much     on the other hand i find a lot of tulle lace to be nice and soft but look too delicate and flimsy and cheap compared to a nice torchon or custom raschel
  lmao the thumbnail looks like an obese black woman in a wheelchair
    these legit look like vivienne westwood pieces to me
  oh lol i kinda saw it
  maybe theres hope for a honey cake rerelease i want the whole damn set especially the bag
  the jacquard they have they used it on the princess of roses op and jsk
i keep trying to like ap but this thread just confirmed for me that itll never be my style feels weird
  i feel the same in general but i absolutely love all my old school ap pieces sadly none of that is shown here
theres lots more on twitter
  this is what i wanted the lolita museum to be but for all brands and with more information about releases still so salty that it turned out to be little more than a vanity project
  what print is the fabric on the table
  was the dress under the cage skirt ever released it looks beautiful and i would definitely sell my everything for it
  i actually didnt they werent posted until after my comment glad i checked back here these two really tug at my heart ap felt so magical to me then     
  this is ugly as sin but fuck i really want it
  it rotates  
  was shit like this mass produced or are there some haute couture pieces that are one of a kind
  i want this thing so fucking bad fuck
    i dont see it
  some dresses were runway only stuff with a much more toned down version sold
i wish they would let people vote on a favorite and rerelease it
  everyone always like omg i love ap and all i have to do is point them to this shit
  what about everything else aps made
  wait what is that white cage skirt thing
  this 
  that would be cool but im sure the chinese would take it over with something stupid
  baby used to do this where for each purchase you made you got one ballot to vote      6000th holy lantern rerelease
  i would kill a man for that wonder cookie fabric
  implying there arent girls who love this silly ott shit  come on anon
  whats the point in being in an ap thread when youre just going to be extra salty and hate ap  so you dont like ap thats fine but why rant in a thread about an ap event
  i love this thing i dont do ott but god bless those who do
  fuck me dead ap
    they may have started out that way but now ott mode in all the substyles will never die so people do wear them to larger fancy events sometimes and its fine im not sure why its a big deal no brand makes a ton of these styles and so they arent really influencing lolita fashion in general im not sure why some people hate them the people who really love very casual lolita should just wear what they love and so too with people who love these very fancy things
  they arent really influencing lolita fashion in general  they are actually because ott coords get the most visibility on social media and create a false image of the fashion so prevalent that even outsiders who dont know anything about lolita think that ott is the standard outsiders opinion doesnt really matter of course until said outsiders decide to join us and treat the fashion like a costume because thats what they think it is silly over the top frilly outfits to wear to events and conventions like cosplay does it stop people from wearing more standard/basic coords obviously not but since more and more newbies are like this the face of the fashion has in fact changed and continues to change for the worst its no longer a street fashion and hasnt been for years
  this makes me sad and i want to deny it but its true
i swear i had a dream about this before i knew it was happening i would kill to go
  i think less simple coords do fit that description but that doesnt stop anyone from paying attention to oldschool styling or casual styling for some lolitas the only place they do wear their coordinates are cons and events and there has been more fancy events and lolita brand teas in recent years so that exposure is actually for the fancier events flashy pieces of fashion are always going to gather more attention they always havebut that doesnt mean its more commonly what we are wearing  meets and meet photos and daily photos are going strong the solid casual simple sweet oldschool severe gothic and nonfussy elegance of non ott classic are all going strong as mainstays     not a street fashion lolbetter call kera and tell them to quit posting those lolita street snaps thencause i visited the site today and there they were    fashion evolves but i dont see many more of these ott dresses being produced regularly in the market than there have ever been and no one can debate that the height of ott sweet at least in the first incarnation of the candy floss frizzheads is actually over i see much less of that than i did several years ago
  you might want to read my post again  i didnt say that basic coords dont exist or that no one wears them but that ott and the exposure it gets online gives a false impression of the fashion in general it doesnt stop lolitas from wearing the fashion how they like whenever and wherever they like but it does make many newbies think that its an ott costume for conventions and meetups  as for kera afaik they have specific photoshoot days/spots to which people sign up for and go to in order to get their pics taken i may be wrong but from my knowledge they dont actually scout the streets looking for actual street fashion
  bury me in this
  i read your post but what newbies think and what gets online exposure are not what most of us who are everyday wearers care about that much    i really dont see these types of dresses affecting the bottom line of the sale of lolita fashion or the brands would be pumping them out in more frequent releases which they never have   and kera and fashion photographers have always done that or handed out cards and made appointments with people from the start of the harajuku fashion boom but theres still plenty of street fashion in tokyo and lolita is still among the styles
  yeah but is it cheap come up with better terms otherwise you look like you lack intelligence
  what you see on social media is what everyone else is seeing on social media  sorry but all the main sm sites use algorithms based on your search history not everyone knows how to filter etc you cant really speak for what gets shown to the public unless you work for one of the major sm sites which i seriously doubt
  sorry nope know your lace cheap craftquality raschel lace is cheaplooking but its not all created equal     dont get me started on all the shitty craftquality ribbon i see
  would it be super tacky to recreate this cage skirt just to wear it for myself it was never released i believe
  great point i often search signed in to google and i deep dive on gothic stuff and do quite a bit of research on both 18th century things and the late victorian period so surprise i see more elaborate and gothic coords but im not the one crying that ott is killing casual either the only thing i dislike about casual lolita style is when the wearers cry about it being underappreciated ignored or not liked enough its casual people often skim over more everyday things
  saaame
  design it slightly different and credit the inspiration and you should be fine as long as whatever else you wear in the coord is high quality and equally as fancy
  nah just do it gull its all gucci
  i would commit murder for some of that sweet fabric and those prototype designs
  this so much its just barely anything more than a vanity project if baby and especially meta were there that would be so much better and moitié
  that sewing corner is so cozy i want more picture of it
  ill post some more for you anon
  the more i look the more i find i really want to buy that lace
  its a pretty full brand retrospective im glad for the large variety it takes more than one narrow style trend or era for a brand to stay profitable especially since lolita is much a niche fashion if ap had only made what a narrow market within lolita fashion liked they might not have even lasted the only things i maybe see underrepresented here are the less ott nonprints blouses in general and in styles the shorter skirts and salopettes reading the guide or catalogue for the exhibit should explain the focus better
  a photo of the ap shop in 2001
  theyre doing that with print releases right now with purchase you get a ballot and can choose from a sheet of prints
  /wistful sigh    thank you for the photos anons
  oh cool any photos of the sheets or what they are called please
  room goals
does anyone else see these pics and think of a mission impossible lolita heist it would be a funny skit for a deerstalker type video
  ugh perfect
  honeycake rerelease when ap
  my forever dd
  im kind of shocked that dreaming macaron is missing because i remember that being what kickstarted the ott sweet trend and obsession with sweets accessories or maybe im just blind and cant see it
  oh wow i forgot this dress existed used to be one of my dream dresses when i first got into the fashion
  as for kera afaik they have specific photoshoot days/spots to which people sign up for and go to in order to get their pics taken i may be wrong but from my knowledge they dont actually scout the streets looking for actual street fashion    this has always been the case there has always been a disconnect between what was in kera/glb streetsnaps and shoots and what people wore it didnt ruin the sanctity of the fashion back then and its not destroying the fashion now
  you know thats being rereleased right now as an mto right
  holy shit
honey cake rerelease when i know theres voting for which dresses should be rereleased do japanese lolitas still not give a shit about hc
    wonder patisserie        but  and          as far as i know theyve released everything except that design its low key infuriating      regular release    tea party ott version  
  one of the chinese ss posted on fb
  please share the choices if you know them so i can tentatively prepare my wallet
  its not a rerelease vote its a textile award
  cant you just share like how should we know chinese ss
  agreed like some of us dont use fb
  fucking honey cake
  they havent said it will be rereleased but what do you think is the end goal of a textile award to rerelease eventually of course
  things i would preorder that seem likely to happen  honey cake  cherry margarite  romantic rose letter  melty cream donut  sugary carnival  day dream carnival    things i would love to see rereleased just because they are so old and worn out now id love new versions in my closet  melody doll  rose toilette  jewelry jelly all of them are so faded and gross now  milky berry    i guarantee you though the chinese are voting for newer stuff like dolly dot the generic cherry prints and the chocolate/british stuff
  thank you sm anon im saving them all to my background inspo to draw later
  milky berry  old and worn out its only been like 2 years hasnt it
  youre thinking ofany of the more recent berry prints  anon is talking about this print released in 2010  
  more like nearly a decade unfortunately
  theres prints on there that just got rereleased and new prints that didnt even sell out
    id probably buy rose toilette in two colourways if it got rereleased but i think youre right its got very slim chances of being voted in by everyone else    some of the choices on  are kinda odd like did milky pony carnival do better than say magical princess or eternal carnival makes you wonder how these were selected and why
      is it just me or are these kind of catering to chinese lolitas
  can someone name this im making my dream dress
  i really wish they would do a rerelease of antoinette decoration to the western market
  pretty sure its a runway dress that was never released   sorry anon
  i know its totally not in vogue right now but i wish we would get more appliqué dresss  theyre so cute and casual
  was this ever available what version was this dress it looks so beautiful but i have no reason to own it
trip report  the fashion show was pretty cool at the start there were these two ladies on violin surrounded by mannequins and one was singing almost like enka reminded of music from umineko no naku koro ni later like 6 white girl models showed up who looked like clones of each other and they started blasting moulin rogue and lady marmalade everyone was wearing a super fancy op   the museum was really nice lots of nostalgic pieces and the designers room bit was very neat reminded me a bit of the ghibli museum which has something similar   all the cool stuff in the shop was already sold out the postcards i voted for honey cake in the print contest   ive always been a baby fan more than an ap fan and today really reinforced that i think ap is trying to be like paris high fashion and thats not my style but i respect it  overall i had a lot of fun and wish ap the best also i hope they rerelease honey cake
  thank you for the report anon sounds generally interesting except for  moulin rogue and lady marmalade  why
  thank you i so wish photos and video were allowed i want to see it aaaaa
  two ladies on violin  singing enka  not knowing kokusyoku sumire   not knowing old school queen sachi  not realizing it was one violin and one accordion    most embarrassing behavior anon
  anon melty cream donut and sugary carnival were both rereleased already
  nayrt but i enjoyed the music this time it was a fun way to start the show and it went with the dresses
  youre totally right   to make up for my embarrassing behavior heres some more details  the show was set up as a figure 8 inside of the museum with circles of mannequins on either side everyone got a great view of all the models walking around you can get a good idea of it from this pic   the show began by dimming the lights and the two girls from kokusyoku sumire standing inside the circles with spotlights on them very atmospheric they played a song or two before the show got in full force and it switched to pop music mode and turned up the lights  there were a few japanese models at the start but the majority were western models in the true sense tall and skinny white girls everyone was wearing extravagant ott ops many with huge wigs done up rococo style i dont know enough about ap to say what they wore but i would guess they were show piece dresses from old fashion shows or those kind of 30k mto dresses chinese girls buy  for a free event it was awesome im going to the baby fashion show tomorrow which isnt free so im curious how they will compare
  bless you for this anon will you post another report of the baby show ill be very interested to hear your thoughts about it
  well the clothes they show on the runways are literally just look how fancy we can make this dress its not the every day style theyre going for   kind of like conceptual pieces on the runway they are impressive but thats not the actual style of ap
  thanks ill post about the baby show in the lolita general thread  also im not going to the ap tea party in december but if any anons are id love to hear a report about that
  tbh i imagine that tall is the right physique for those crazy expensive dresses the reason i dont like them is because every time i see them in fashion shows the models look swamped in ruffles that make them look kind of stumpy so maybe this is the one time itd be useful to be a tallita providing you also have 30k
  wow i wonder why they would cater towards their main market
  close up video  
  is that lily cole
  its fucking glorious thank you for the link i dont really remember but i think its the ott runway version of candy fairy im sure someone will correct me if im wrong
  im really interested to know what books those are i assume the designers use them for inspiration
  dunno what the bottom one is but the top one appears to be a french language edition of 
  exactly what i thought anon
  i hope to see a video of this id love to see the dresses moving
  need
  found a closer picture  i dont think it is
  here you go anon
  hnggg
  the baby show will likely be different in that theyll show their new collection the ap show was showing off old ott items plus a new vivienne westwood inspired kind of tartan dress that seemed to be just made for the event probably no lady marmalade at baby either they seem more like britney fans
  god i love seeing the dress illustrations
  id watch the shit out of that i wish theyd go back to doing more lolita related videos
  their lolita stuff has far more views than their cosplay stuff so why dont they go back to it i think one of their lolita vids has 1 million views or something
  youtube automatically demonetizes videos with the name lolita in them and doesnt always if ever monetizes them again after manual review id imagine thats too much of a hassle for deerstalkers to deal with
  oh shit thats right youtube is such a mess
  personally i can tell two reasons their latter cast isnt as good as it was before lets be honest its not just about mf leaving other girls used to make a really good job playing for mean lolitas and others nowadays cast looks just awkward also community has changed its turned out less subcultural people dont seem to be that much into lolita memes and inner jokes and from this point skit videos look a bit oldfashioned
  i would kill if they did an updated version of pastel a la mode
  what print is this
  melody toys i think its the high waist jsk
from the fashion show one of models i wish theyd just post it on twitter so it wouldnt be this crappy quality   
i am pretty surprised to see chess chocolate not represented on a mannequin    it seemed like a huge deal when i first got back into lolita around 2011 and i feel like its a classic    it was probably my first dream dress and still one if not is my absolute favorite followed closely by halloween treats op
  photos and videos were allowed id post my vids from ig but i dont want to out myself
  derp sorry pics and vids werent allowed at the fashion show only everything else was ok to photograph
    its one of the posters in  if that makes you feel better i feel like they did leave out a lot of stuff like twinkle mermaid just has this poster  for it but its a notable landmark release as one of the earliest colourful prints 2006 with a pastel wig a precursor to what eventually became ott pastel sweet that basically took over lolita form 2010 to 2013    i know they cant display everything due to space but i wonder how they decided what to display maybe they just went with what eyecandy they think their audience would want to look at and not so much whats historically important
  of the museum photos ok but no flash or video fashion show nothing allowed
    would it be possible to buy lace from ap or is that a pipedream
  their custom made lace dream on the best you can do is find dupes from lacestaobaocom
   lacestaobaocom  ugh i figured appreciate the link though ill probably find something similar there
  courtesy
  giant print posters wallpapering the room  i want this life
  those sceptres are giving me inspiration for decorating my walking stick i dont need it much though yet    mfw arthritic knees at 21
  its not even their best chocolate dress i think it only seemed to be everywhere due to replicas
  it was a big deal at the time it was hard to get because of the limit of how many items a ss can get just was made there wasnt as many local ss to ask either so s hsndful was originally bought from the western comm but i dont know if it was considered that big to japanese lolitas
  i feel like ap cares more about things that were probably more of a landmark or left the biggest impression on the designers whereas i feel like if baby were to do something like this they would use pieces that were more historic and iconic along with showing how the designs have changed
  what is the difference in something being historic and iconic as opposed to being a landmark arent those the same
as a photographer how can you photograph this and be okay with yourself seems like this photographer has a track record of doing this    itt cringe photographers making people look worse than they probably are
  i guess i can appreciate that it isnt shooped to plastic skin town and back but im sure this is not shot in the most flattering light nor angle
    exactly my thoughts he also is a foot fetishist it seems from his gallery what i dont get is how the fuck does he convince these girls to do this shit does he pay them ask i cant imagine that conversation     hey stick your feet in this suspicious white goo i made and let me take pics of it please
  be unfit fatass  have layers of cellulite around every inch of your body  lacks selfawareness to the extent that you have the absolute gall to cosplay characters with revealing costumes  pay poor photographer to take pictures of your disgusting frame  photo accurately reflects how disgusting you are  reee its the photographers fault  piss off landwhale
    look through the photographers gallery you uncultured swine this isnt about just about the photographer its also the fact he isnt doing the poor girl any favours for angles or lighting to not make her look as bad
  except thats a terrible photo look at that you have no taste or knowledge or composition if you think thatd be a good photo of an attractive person
  op girl honestly doesnt even look that fat its just standard cellulite  not good lighting
  how the fuck does he convince these girls to do this shit  its just some pictures they arent being asked to to clear a mine field or something
    how would you feel if some noname creeper ass dude came up to you said hey step in this white stuff while i take closeups of your feet unless hes paying them i cant imagine people being very willing
  you know no is a valid response right do you really think everage just cold approaches and scores a hit every single time i also wouldnt call him a noname since hes been doing this for close to a decade now  unless hes paying them i cant imagine people being very willing  maybe just maybe other people are more outgoing and adventurous than you even if he does pay them who the fuck cares its not you getting photographed and its not your money
  im a professional fetish model have been for years not into cosplay though and these photos and models are equally awful and trashy i guess gross amateurs are attracted to each other and can fulfill their needs through each other and theyre not really hurting anyone except my eyes    theres a clear lack of taste and ive come across that in my work pervy men whos portfolios are full of badly lit trashy models in bad lingerie who clearly dont know how to pose or look good for a photo but the photographer doesnt care as long as her tits are out theyre trying to emulate cheap porn they have no discerning eye or creative artistry its just about what makes their dick twitch it saddens me that girls have such low self esteem that they wanna take their clothes off for random creeps for validation when they can get paid for it no matter how ugly you are lol therell be someone desperate enough its gotten worse with the rise of instagram too every thot even the pretty ones want professional shots done so theyll find whatever beta with a dslr is willing its made my business suffer a little but thankfully people know that if you want quality and professionalism you get what you pay for
  cottage  h  e  e  s  e
  fetish model  calling anybody else trashy  surely you dont genuinely believe that what youre doing is in any way art right youre literally taking pictures for people to get off to it makes perfect sense that photographers in that business would also go for things that make their dick twitch because thats essentially the goal  furthermore if youre a pro why do you feel the need to shit on obvious amateurs this guy and his models are running on deviantart accounts and little else theres hardly any money to be made if at all its two hacks coming together to make something hacky because they can  im a professional automotive technician if i felt the need to criticize every backyard diyer i came across on the internet id have carpal tunnel in a week and those are people who actually have the ability to harm others a shitty cosplay photographer isnt hurting anybody at all except maybe his own reputation
  he will deliberately take photos in an upwards angle to emphasize his fat fetish which makes otherwise attractive cosplayers look unflattering       i guess gross amateurs are attracted to each other and can fulfill their needs  damn
  dude youre literally just parroting what i was trying to say i never claimed my work is high art or nothing of the sort and the only way im better than these girls is that im clever enough to capitalise off my sluttiness it just saddens me to see girls devaluing themselves and giving it away for free theyre not really hurting anyone but as i said the popularization and accessibility of amateur porn and the rise of the internet has affected those in the business for longer but thats the way it works im not complaining just putting forward my opinion/experiences as someone who has worked in the industry    to put it in terms you might relate to its like if the automotive industry suddenly became so overrun with hobbyists who are unable to see the difference between their shoddy work and professional quality that it saturated the market and appealed to a blinded audience im sure you would have something to say if that was the case dont subreddits like /shittycarmods and such exist how do expect people who arent self aware enough to recognise their own lack of skill to improve if you dont let them know
  how do expect people who arent self aware enough to recognise their own lack of skill to improve if you dont let them know  because in most cases they dont want to improve were both talking about hobbyists  you and i need to improve because theres money on the line more skill means more money but when money isnt a factor there isnt much drive to improve quickly or at all thats why four of my own cars and my motorcycle are sitting unfinished in a shop 15 miles away and have been for years im not getting paid to work on them so theres no rush i know the guy whos in charge of deadlines and hes full of shit  youre also dealing with the mentality nurtured by a generation of permissive parents that you and you alone know how best to do the thing and all outside criticism no matter how constructive is just people being butthurt that they cant actually do the thing like you can  unless the artist in question is actively seeking advice and has a history of acting on said advice all youre doing is wasting keystrokes
  wasting keystrokes  writing paragraphs about a topic that isnt even relevant to the board    go back to /o/ m8 at least i was offering topical discussion dunno if its anything like the auto industry but particularly in creative ones its overrun with lowered standards and employers of freelancer being led to think that you can pay little or nothing at all due to crappy content being so readily available i dont think its as bad as you say to aspire to better your field and craft be it creative or not hobbyist or pro you have an influence complacency is a killer
  i dont think its as bad as you say to aspire to better your field and craft be it creative or not hobbyist or pro you have an influence complacency is a killer  then by all means go tell everage hes a shit photog and how he can get good im sure hell appreciate it
   i mean he just asks them probably strikes a convo with them too about their cosplay give them compliments and really focus on what they are saying just like in any conversation     if they say no then he leaves simple as that
  no thanks would rather help these clueless costhots make a business for themselves out of stomping in weird goo in skimpy costumes but i think the world has enough of that already    sorry i dont have a personal vendetta i was just trying to answer ops question and offer some perspective from behind the lens as many people in this thread seem confused but i suppose thats to be expected from you virgins who are secretly jealous you dont have the misguided courage of this guy i hope yall at least pay for your porn whilst you shit on the women providing the service
  how can you photograph this and be okay with yourself  gotta pay the bills
  fair point only this photographer does mostly if not all free shoots
  how would you feel  id just say no its just not crazy to think some would say yes
you cosplayers run around flashing your bare asscheeks to the world in your 2b costumes yet you get offended when someone wants a pic of your feet    why is feet worse than tits and ass
  feet is easier to get a creepshot of than tits and ass its pretty easy to figure out if a photographer is taking upskirts not so easy to figure out theyre taking foot shots
  not so easy to figure out theyre taking foot shots  gonna take a guess its the person whose camera is aimed at peoples feet
as a photographer i dont take these shots unless the cosplayer themselves ask its a unflattering photo and angle that said id describe this photographer more as a gwc
truly a master of the art
  why
  jesus christ i met this guy in person when i was a teenager he was a friend of a friend of mine and even back then was asking underage girls to do fetish shoots with him by telling them it was fun or artsy or some shit im glad i never got involved with him
    oh whatever you fat whore the only difference between queefa in the op and yourself is photoshop prove me wrong
    you sound butthurt because people are getting their feet pics for free instead of paying you
      this dude isnt a cos photog lol hes a known foot fetishist with a dslr who preys on young naive girls who dont see a problem when he suggests poses such as take off your shoes and pretend to be stuck in glue or let me handcuff you because theyre just excited to have their photos taken by a self proclaimed professional cosplay photographer obviously content quality isnt his priority
  that ass got a a point though  two of them
  who dont see a problem  what is the problem
      you cant tell me someone like the pic above didnt know what was happening when dude asked her to take off her shoes and stick her feet in front of the camera im the most gullible girl ever and even i would never fall for that shit    preys on is a harsh word if someone is retarded enough to think shes getting photographed for free and agrees to start stepping barefoot in goo they dont have a right to say hey preyed on me later to save face when she ends up in his fapping gallery
honestly any of you calling ops pic fat is an absolute troglodyte loads of women have cellulite there especially taken from such a bad angle besides she doesnt even look remotely fat come on im on the skinny side and i still have cottage cheese ass and cottage cheese thighs    sage for blogposting but some of you need to stop being so delusional
  this isnt a photographer anyone can replicate these pix with a smartphone  without any brain cells in full auto mode     for comparison here is a picture made by my 17 yo cousin with a 300 dollar camera after i literally showed him how to use it
  on the dirty convention floor in front of god and everyone else
stop being close minded and appreciate the artistic merit
  i still have cottage cheese ass and cottage cheese thighs  is that what they taste like hahah  just wondering of course haha
  tldr waaaah waaaah my fee fees are hwurt qq
  kek
  this aint hot rod magazine pal
  your 17 year old cousin sucks at taking pictures
  trying so hard to act like one of the mean girls to fit in  cringy
  feet people are truly the oddest race
  agreed why are white landwhales so fucking gag inducing holy shit the white skin was not made to be this pale
  that qualifies as trying i see why your not an engineer
   what are you even trying to say      my thoughts lel
  toecuffs    why
  i feel dizzy just looking at that picture  im not sure what you mean though you can use a smartphone camera and be a photographer literally any professional photography will tell you that the equipment doesnt mean much  you sound like someone who thinks better camera  better pictures
  how do that ass brap
  what gets me with this is that hes so incompetent that its not the feet or even the face that are in focus but the shins
  the cringelords you see on the internet are a vocal minority most of us just want to be normal
  pretty much this
  so many people spout that just use what you have shit but no one decent actually uses a smartphone as their main device
  because decent people prefer a better device that they can configure more and have a smoother experience  the point is that a professional with a smartphone camera will be able to take better pictures than an amateur with a professional camera skill  equipment
  theres a clear lack of taste  he cant get it up so clearly cant have a taste      why is feet worse than tits and ass  we ask permission to take photos of their tits and ass we never ask for feet so they get mad       making mother proud        real pros use full auto on their cameras      young naive girls who dont see  he is a photographer young naive girls is his brand
    there was a cosplay photographer that did some photos on his cellphone but i forgot who they were now but saw the photos on instagram i liked how they showed the before and after the before showed a weird aspect ratio due to the phones sensor and the after was it clean up and processed to fit their standard aspect ratio and photoshopping of effects liked that they were transparent with what was changed
  this girl oesnt seem fat but ok anon lets judge someone who weve never talked to b4 uwu
    that picture was taken at the irish famine memorial    fun little trivia nugget
  you
    as someone who had this happen to them in their first few years of cosplaying i had no idea what his deal was then it was the first time i had ever seen him    the way he acted was friendly but he did pressure me to take off my socks after i already took off my shoes grudgingly it was really weird and i was a naive 17 year old    i would say looking back it seems a little predatory
  you dont see a problem with tricking underage girls into posing for fetish photos for him to upload to foot fetish websites      im sure some people were aware but he very clearly targetted very young girls who didnt understand what his angle was preying on is literally the perfect word for the situation  he exploits the naivety of people new to the community and maybe not aware enough to recognize that taking your shoes off isnt just for cute poses       yeah im in the same boat i definitely did shoots with him when i was like 13 and just into the scene maybe kids now are more aware but i was definitely too sheltered to realize there was anything sexual going on
  you cant just tease me like this and not post a name you little fucknut
  you dont see a problem with tricking underage girls into posing for fetish photos for him to upload to foot fetish websites  no explain the issue
  i assume you love the good photographer bad camera youtube metaseries its the best imho
  you dont see a problem with tricking underage girls into posing for fetish photos for him to upload to foot fetish websites    deviantart isnt a foot fetish website
    it is if you do it right
  its like someone tricking you into posing with your pecs on display and then posting you to lactation kink group its giving other people the impression you are into a fetish that you are not a rude and shitty thing to do
  you somehow managed to make analogy worse than food ones
  and then posting you to lactation kink group  what  that doesnt even make sense but either way its not tricking anyone i have literally no idea what people do with pictures taken of me why should i care unless you specifically tell someone you are using the pictures for one thing and you use it for another otherwise ive never asked or care what someone uses a picture of me for
  when someone takes a picture of you theres an unspoken rule that theyre not going to use it in ways that go against your image/brand of course what that entails is very vague and your brain naturally doesnt run through all the possibilities of failure same reason why people fuck up their 3 genie wishes when you wish for your wife to love you her entire life is it tricking you if the genie just kills your so right away i find that taking advantage of someones lack of oversight is a form of trickery     i digress personally im jaded enough by all these 4chan years to not care about what people do with my pictures however i can 100 see why a young girl might girls are coerced by society to cherish their reputation after all a girl who doesnt care about her reputation becomes an easy target to blame when she encounters incidents that are actually serious i dont think these girls are in the wrong when they feel anxious after discovering that they got posted to a foot fetish group rather the wrong is on the photog who violated the societal guideline of do not involve nonconsenting randos with your weird kinks
  ass
  theres an unspoken rule that theyre not going to use it in ways that go against your image/brand  so you dont tell people what you want you just magically expect them to know what you are and arent ok  you must have an interesting life    same reason why people fuck up their 3 genie wishes  anon genie wishes arent real     an easy target to blame when she encounters incidents that are actually serious  what is serious about this
there is no evidence of everage posting photots to foot fetish groups or websites    he posts them to deviantart if other people put them in fetish groups thats not his fault
  incorrect the rule is they took the picture they own that image and they can do what they want with it im not saying its fair or good but its what you should expect
  they took the picture they own that image and they can do what they want with it    if you took a picture of someone  they are not just in the background they are the focus of the picture and they didnt want to its illegal the picture is not yours nor can you do what you want with it you can get sued in many countries
  its illegal  do you have some code to back that up or is it just your common sense in public space in the us its not generally not against the codes unless the photos are used for financial gain
  rather the wrong is on the photog who violated the societal guideline of do not involve nonconsenting randos with your weird kinks    pretty much this he 100 has glue/handcuff/foot fetishes and has said as much himself more recently but involving people who have no idea is messed
  she would be pretty cute with a decent photog wtf
  involving someone in a sexual fetish without their knowledge/consent is shitty
      the photographer owns the copyright to the photo the subject of the photo doesnt own the copyright but they do have publicity rights the subject cannot do anything with the photo without the photographers permission since even posting it online is a copyright issue however any photographer that prevents you from posting the photo even on your own social media sites are assholes and should be blacklisted personal opinion    the photographer meanwhile cant do anything in a commercial way with the photo of identifiable subjects without the permission of the subjects aside from editorial use    also each state has their own laws on publicity rights as do countries and the laws that are in effect are where the photo was taken not where the photographer or subject lives
cant beleive how naive people are  do you really not know foot fetish exists by the time you are seventeen
  thats why he mostly chooses girls under 17 lol
  fixed
  this 100   if you grew up in an environment completely devoid of computers and books i would understand    but how do you reach age 13 or whatever puberty age without learning about common/basic fetishes thru books or the internet or movies etc
  do you really not know foot fetish exists by the time you are seventeen  not everyone spent 10 hours a day on the internet exposing themselves to weird fetishes as a 15 year old
  kek absolutely based
  but how do you reach age 13 or whatever puberty age without learning about common/basic fetishes thru books or the internet or movies etc  half of 13 year olds arent even 100 on how babies are made letalone that people like to jerk off to feet
  i didnt discover feet people till i was 19 and i had hardcore jav and hentai shit when i was a kid feet are like the strange fetish tbf
  mambo man
  cant have her toes running away now
the photoshopping triggers me im triggered
  thats tasteless af   seppos are disgusting
  looks like he didnt know well enough that he was supposed to shoot with the sun in front of her instead of in back of her so he tried to up the exposure in post to compensate
why is it okay for a photographer to pay a woman to undress for him but if i do it its illegal and im a sex offender
why do women in cosplay always feel like the slutty things they do arent their own damn fault take some responsibility if a photographer looks creepy dont say yes look at the photos after they are done and if you dont like them you tell the probably 50 year old man to not post them     if you accept you are doing these kinds of photos then dont be surprised at the audience you will attract if youre not comfortable with that audience dont do those kinds of pics youll never be jessica nigress so dont even try
  so youre supposed to not judge people by their looks and give guys a chance but not talk to people who look creepy and if someones a creep anyway you really think politely asking them to delete the photos or not post them is going to work   women choosing to wear cosplays that make them feel good and yeah possibly sexy doesnt make them a slut and doesnt excuse anything thats done to them their own damn fault this sounds like a line by a fucking rapist
  wears clevage revealing cosplay  why are all these men staring at me onichan  rides their skirt up and asks the beta tog to take a pic of their arse  onichan why do these creepy men keep objectifying me  horny men after seeing this women show off her bare arse online on purpose and with full consent on her own instagram start approching her  bbut onichan im not doing anything to make myself look approchable i just want my privacy  despite all of this wears skimpy cosplays and takes revealing photos because it feels good    speaking as a self proclaimed costhot whos been around the block a few times you girls really need to grow up   if you want to be a thot just be one if you genuinely are uncomfortable with that kind of attention do less revealing cosplays its not like your only options are a bikini or a burka if you have the actual talent make a good cosplay you dont need to rely on skimpy clothes if you want to rely solely on your body because it feels good then thats on you even if you are wearing skimpy shit most people wont approch you because most cosplay men are beta af the only ones who try shit are the 50 year old fuckers who are obvious creeps you learn to avoid them and stick with your friends so no one gets grabby and i have to taze them    i
  if thats pale to you then im fucked
  her skin colour is the least of her problems she really needs to hit the gym
  to be fair seeing a sexy photo of someone on a public social media site isnt really an open invite to approach them that idea is ridiculous but i agree with the other stuff
tom danger savage aka everage studios is a perv he has ignored constant pleas from his friends to stop shooting fetish themes at conventions/in public what you do in private time is your own thing but to do it in public    he consistently tries to justify his grooming of foot fetish girls with the guise of i dont force them to do anything i just ask     a lot of girls in the toronto cosplay community are desperate to get famous and he will shoot them for free thats why girls go to him if you notice he never has models stay with him for more than a couple years at a time the always move onto better photographers and just faze him out
  how does this her legs happen to someone who is not hugely fat
  what do you reveal every part of your psyche to everyone you meet to avoid taking advantage of them in some way your post reveals dangerous thinking
  many vein diseases are genetic cellulite is more a skin problem than a fat problem ignorant people tend to attribute such things to weight
  its the majority of women who have cellulite not the opposite
  bmi 165 here still have cellulite less than that girl though it has not much to do with being fat

  11 is rediculous i wonder how can you even walk in that without tripping over your own socks    i like 7 best too for loose socks not too much but also just enough of a loose sock  personally i would love to see a revival f the 1989 three fold socks one  it seems from the chart that its sort of cycling back around though as now many school girls like over ankle length socks and scrunch them down which is not too far off from 1989 3 folded so maybe in the next 10 years we will be back at loose socks again
if anyones interested kazuharuhina  instagram/twitter does a lot of uniform of the day drawings  they seem to really like drawing uniforms all their artwork is of school girls and its pretty cute
  ill drop a few more examples let me know if anyone wants more ive got a bunch of them
colourful coordinate inspo
  the majority of gulls are not japanese so youre not alone
i want to start a nanchatte closet but where can i find stuff
  bodyline conomi taobao yja etc
  i really liked the 90s socks i remember wanting to go out of my way to get some of those and thought they were the pinnacle of japanese schoolgirl fashion is there some resource list or links to buy those types
  the loose socks you can find them on sock dreams or ebay/amazon as japan loose socks
    cheap loose socks
  this uniform looks like something out of a latin american soap opera for teens and tweens that airs on disney channelslightly betterprobably which is were my interest for uniforms comes from i think most of them only aired in latin americaspain and italy gulls please share your favourite school uniforms from media pic related is what i used to watch when youngerthe whole show is covered in awful y2k fashioni love it
  seconding sock dreams their quality is great and they have fantastic customer service
  what brand is this
what do you guys think of adding patches to blazers/cardigans do you personally do it do you like using a generic school looking patch or something that reflects more of your personality/interests     was thinking of getting some patches for my blazer and cardis recently so i have been wondering
    love this thanks anon      besides the obvious try looking at local thrift stores lots of students dump things when they outgrow them/graduate you only need one skirt for the memories
  i love patches as a little touch to an outfit i own two one with feathers and a chain which is very extra and clearly for fashion and one plain embroidered one that looks a lot more authentic
  i love this account here are some others with seifuku themes on instagram    matsumotooon_  shintarokago1969  hezmilmagical  sekituidoubutu  rina1069
  60 or 120cm    where do these socks sit when theyre worn midcalf and knee height
  youre supposed to push them below your knees the longer the sock the more bunched up
  thanks for the patch inspo anon im still on the hunt for some patches that id like for my blazer/cardigans but this gave me a lot of ideas
  asian women are selfconscious about have short legs  continue to lengthen their torso and cut of the line of their legs even more  silly they need to leave the bottom open a bit or go for a shorter cardigan
  projection isnt cute anon
  wow how dare anyone criticize asian women right if you do youre just projecting
  the point of the long cardigan is to show as little skirt as possible  asian women  no just japanese
  high waist all the way it definitely makes you look longer in my opinion
do japanese girls ever sell their uniforms secondhand
  isnt that how y auction or rakuten have their stuff
its nice to see the nanchatte threads again i hope we can get the discord moving again too  small conomi dump since
  meant to say since i felt inspired lately lol
  dropped my pic sorry
  i dont usually care for sailor uniforms but i think they look quite cute under a cardigan
  sometimes but it depends on the school certain schools ban students from selling their uniforms secondhand due to perverts buying them up and it reflecting badly on the school name       discord moving again  how active is the discord right now
  someone posted minutes ago if more people start chattingwe might be able to keep the momentum and have a semiactive nanchatte online community of sorts
hey trish no amount of cute clothes will make up for your awful personality
  this is adorable    im thinking about starting a nanchatte closet this winter id enjoy sewing my own skirts and bows since i can find easily super cute fabrics would that be okay
  id love to join can you post the link or is it a private discord of some sort sorry i dont know much about discord
  who the hell is trish
  there are online store for secondhand uniforms but to weed out the pervs you have to register with them and show proof of id to buy from them i dont think most of them ship internationally it probably works the same way for physical shops
  a girl with self esteem issues who dismisses her own friends as normies
      and what does this have to do with seifuku exactly
  
 do you like/not like about what school uniforms are becoming today   i hate how cheap a lot of the stuff for sale looks like the materials look so bad  im also not a fan of blazers with high contrast piping even though i know there are uniforms like that they just look extra costumey to me for some reason    s your favourite style blazer/vest cardigan/blousepolo shirt sailor  i really love sailor shirts especially when under a cardigan otherwise a vest and box cut blazer ive also seen combos of a blazer with a sailor collar but i dont know how common those actually are     do you wear nanchatte   i havent gotten to do so for a while but usually when im just out and about   does your family/friends think about dressing in nanchatte   no one has ever said a thing
  high contrast piping  whats that supposed to be
  piping is kind of like trim see  
snbl currently has a bunch of cheap nanchatte inspired coats and outfits  i own a lot of stuff from them and always loved the quality  
thoughts on wearing black leggings with nanchatte  its not the same as wearing tights i know but i can only find thick leggings not thick tights i live in canada where it can get quite cold  i wear leggings with rainboots so they get tucked in i just hope that makes them look close enough to tights obviously i try not to wear my leggings with sneakers or loafers that looks messy
  i think black leggings with rainboots or ugg boots can be a nice combination when it gets really cold here i wear loose socks over leggings i find keeping it monochrome is weird but gray leggings with white socks is fine for instance
does anyone know how long it takes hug sunshine to ship orders
  a day or two once your shopping service confirms the order also make sure theres not a holiday going on in china
  okay thank you i ordered two weeks ago but havent heard anything from bhiner to say the order has arrived
  contact bhiner and ask about it
how is stuff from lawara shop
bodyline is having a 50 off what would be something of decent quality
  the skirts are decent sometimes i bought 4 of them a while back and 3 of them were great and 1 was just okay i wouldnt suggest the sets most of them are more costumey than not
  go to passingfancy instead lawara is just a reseller of candysugar which is cheaper to buy direct
  these are all such cute combos  very lovely
  how do you buy candysugar directly and lawarashop seems to have some other stuff that passingfancy doesnt have like some styles of sailor uniforms i think passingfancy primarily resells things from cecile
does anyone have tips on dressing nanchatte even in very cold weather i need to purchase a parka and nothing seems to have the right aesthetic its going to be too cold for a duffel/pea coat 
  thermal tightsand maybe socks over them and for the coatstry getting a very thick woolen coat
  function over fashion always no one cares how cute or perfectly balanced your outfit is if youve got frostbite  that being said thermal undershirts tights and layering jackets help a lot
  i would love to have a woolen coat i think it would match perfectly and im probably going to get one to wear in fall/spring but i think i need something waterproof when it comes to winter      function over fashion  agreed i dont stay out long enough to get frostbite though so i can sacrifice just a little function i think ive been layering as much as i can but the final piece of the puzzle is a jacket thats right in the perfect intersection of cute and warm
  i have no shame at all in doing this on really cold days where i have to suffer cold for a while but am eventually going indoors not just in nanchatte
  i dont even go here but as someone who had to wear skirts to school even in cold winters its really about the under layers keep key areas warm like your chest your neck and your ears i used to wear extra shorts under my skirts over my tights     of course paired with a cute jacket this will get you to like 15c at most colder requires less pretty outerwear unless youre a masochist though you can still dress it up cutely like tie your scarf in a bow or something i think as long as you have that sort of silhouette/vibes that the school skirt gives off i would still recognize it as nanchatte
  try buying something like this and wearing it under your coat
  wear a raincoat over it orif youre willing to shell out a lot of moneyi think that conomi or eastboy have waterproof coats
  hah i used to wear sweatpants under my uniform skirt like that    i can suffer the cold to a certain degree but when it gets to be 25 celsius after wind chill you get frostbitten in several minutes if i had a car i think it wouldnt matter much but i take public transit and often wait up to a half hour for transfers       i honestly just have a parka and sure its down to my knees and covers everything cute about my outfit but at least i can wear a cute hat and mitts and stuff go for a cute colours like pastel pink or blue if you can find something i know its tricky as usually winter stuff is so drab and for winter boots make sure you go waterproof and frostproof but maybe with some fluffy trim or pompoms or something
  wait up to a half hour  are you waiting aboveground without any shelter where im from our trains are largely underground
    im sorry but thats beyond sheltered and into stupid territory even if what you say is true surely you realise other cities depend on buses and above ground rail for public transport
  what would you call the style of the girl on the rights socks
  loose socks
  hahaha thatd be nice no my city is too small for trains there used to be street cars in the 60s and those got nixed and the buses are often late or they skip a scheduled bus and some buses only come once every 30 minutes 1 hr on sundays there are bus shelters at some stops but theyre not heated nor do they have actual doors you can close they just keep the wind and precipitation off you a little bit
so i know this is more americanizedbut i enjoyed the show gossip girl for the the uniform inspired fashion
    hug sunshine has their coats in
any good instagram nanchatte accounts     jojou_joy is my favorite but id like more if anyone knows of any
    more of her outfits because i think theyre cute
are kogal and nanchatte similar
  as far as looks basically im not really sure about in any other ways though
  kogal is just nanchatte for gyaru so add the makeup and hair of a gyaru to a nanchatte uniform tanning optional considering that most gyaru these days no longer tan
  its so rare to see leggingssocks combo in jfashion but i think it matches nanchatte so well      like  said kogal is basically gyaru nanchatte there is a difference in comm attitude but nowadays theyre more or less fused together
  most of the ones i am following are shops but here you go    conomi_official  olivedesoliveschoolnet  kankoshopharajuku  lucypopjapan  kankoshopharajuku_snap  bqjk  kishichu  _ravenwww
  recommendations for nanchatte oriented taobao shops
  
is there a way i can make nanchatte work for me it looks beyond frumpy on me and id like to look less frumpy boxy fridge woman and more cute and playful
  lose the garter skirt is too short   possibly different socks ones without the ruffles and lace looks too costumes
  sorry i should have mentioned that pic related isnt me but she seems cute and playful instead of frumpy despite the layers/cardi/etc which is what i want
  she doesnt look cute and playful tbqh she looks rather cosplayish especially with that garter  socks combo
  it all depends on your bodytype what kind of skrits are you buying your cardigans etc a certain type of boxiness is expected
    seconding the cosplay vibe shes also contorting herself to show off her waist and bust you can try the pose for yourself in the mirror shell look boxy standing straight unless its very tight thats just how more accurate uniform fashions are if you just like the overall feeling more than the actual style you can go for preppy instead   
  i really dislike the way a straight skirt looks on me and ive occasionally seen girls wair what looks like maybe a light light petti under them is this possible is this actually what they do or is it just an underskirt what sort of petti/underskirt would work for this
  no thats just the plaid skirt on its own since its high waisted your hips make it a bit wider at the bottom
  this is pretty yikes     this makes me nervous to look at
  center one looks great
  you might just not have a good waist to hip ratio i dont wear a petti and my skirts look the same way
  aliexpress has some tights you can find with the fuzzy lining inside
  buying from aliexpress ebay or taobao carries the risk the tights wont fit right if youre taller than 54 or have muscular or slightly chubby legs    of all the fleece lined tights ive ordered from these places one fit properly two fit soso the rest had the crotch ride down so bad i couldnt wear them     hm iirc and walmart have both sold fleece lined leggings at some point and if anyone knows of any sellers that sell plus size tights hmu i want some better colour variation
  i havent checked this year but sockdreams has had fleece lined leggings/tights in the past
wearing nanchatte seifuku out today for the first time i have a question though i got this seifuku from bodyline and its actually quite nice except the skirt for whatever reason the skirt will not stay pleated luckily i have one of their separate skirts which is leagues ahead of the seifuku skirt in quality but i have seen other girls wearing bodyline seifuku sets and they seem to stay pleated would perhaps ironing the pleats down help or am i jsut out of luck anyone have any bodyline uniform tips    also did anyone buy any of the skirts or sets in the sale i picked up 3 different skirts and one of their newish uniform blouses to try out ill let you know what i think about them when they come in overall i have pretty good things to say about bodylines skirt separates but im really not feeling the set skirts right now
  dumb question but how do you tie seifuku ribbons this way i was attempting to tie a ribbon like this before and i just couldnt get it right does the ribbon itself have to be a certain length
  how do you tie seifuku ribbons  
conomi lucky bags are out         not stay pleated  what do you mean by this im assuming you already removed the stitching at the bottom
heres the page with all of the fukus  
    kinda loving fuku a but looking at the display pictures it would suck to pay 90140shipping just to get an outfit that didnt match at all
  yeah i wish there were conomi lucky bag reviews like for lolita and gyaru brands if everything matches it would be worth it
going to keep an eye out and see if there are any new years lucky bags for hug sunshine or other taobao nanchatte shops
  this is my favorite uniform of all time
  madeline    g o o d
living in japan and seeing girls wearing super cute uniforms makes me want to wear nanchatte so bad i want to go to conomi and spend all my money there but im not used to shopping anywhere than thrift stores im still hoping to luck out and find something fitting at one the conomi fuku are tempting but id rather try stuff on before buying
  good luck friend maybe search around and see if there are any good specific secondhand shops to go to
  they dont let you try things on they let me try on a whole outfit
  ive been to the conomi store in harajuku and youre definitely allowed to try on clothes there i tried on a sailor outfit skirt top and ribbon i dont think they usually get many people at once so there was great customer service there was an old woman working there at the time and she was incredibly nice to me the only thing is she was so nice that i would have felt bad if id left the place emptyhanded and all the stuff is super nice i ended up buying a school bag sailor top and ribbons so if youre ready to spend all your money there then go for it
  if you dont know them already just quickly look up japanese changing room etiquette eg taking shoes off and the like and youll be fine
  did she have reddish hair i love her i was there last year and talked to her i went in with a plan to buy a cardigan though so i was ok lol
hello students  did anyone happen to own this sakura schoolbag is it heavy and with weak hooks or alright quality overall   i had a really similar retro bag and it was impossible for everyday use had to replace hooks twice so i wonder if its the same
  that was actually made as a cosplay bag one of mikus school outfits has it   but i mean trivia aside i have nothing to say
  i have it but ive never used it because its literally so narrow that my wallet doesnt fit in it to be fair my wallet is large its literally like an inch front to back its very much for looks and not for function i was pretty disappointed
  conomi seems like its the only place that has adequate male nanchatte so once i get to japan in the spring thats gonna be the first place i go so i can stop living off of the thrifted pseudouniform stuff i have here  especially looking forward to getting one of their cardigans
  tfw i have the brown one and havent worn it yet because im too self conscious about wearing nanchatte out hmmm
this was my first time trying nanchatte i really like the style but im wondering can i improve at all
  its a really good first try    this is just my personal opinion but    get a wig that compliments the colors natural color is best  unbutton the bottom 1 or 2 buttons on cardigan to avoid squeezing skirt to death  different shoes or ditch the leg warmers because both together look odd
  the first anon gave pretty good feedback but ill add that it looks like the skirt pleats need to be ironed and you might be able to get away with the legwarmers if theyre a darker color or you change the shoes the blackwhiteblack transition is just a bit harsh and distracting the cardigan is really cute id love to know where you got it from the plush elements are a nice detail
  i think the cardi looks too cosplayish desu it looks more like a cheapo sweat shirt than a nice knit school cardigan id also ditch the leg warmers if you really wanted that look i think loose socks would look better also maybe iron the pleats of the skirt and unbutton the last few buttons on the cardi to prevent the skirt from being pinched in too much otherwise its good for a first time i love the little usa on your bag
  i think it was just the sweater making the pleats look so wrinkled i didnt realize to unbutton the last two  the cardigan i found a white cardigan at the thrift store and bravely dyed it pink i got lucky the pink turned out right i had to iron on the b      in what way does it look cosplayish may i ask i definitely need to get loose socks i figured the warmers would do for now the skirt was definitely ironed i guess the sweater did some major pinching ill fix it  thank you for the advice and i wish usa was more useful and not just a really cute decorative charm
  i definitely have natural color wigs so ill use those next time i just wanted to have color that day to try and brighten my mood ya know
  i said it looks cosplayish because it looks more like a sweatshirt hoodie type material than a good knit cardi it might just be the picture quality though i do love the patch on it and i think you did really well with colors the only thing a bit off to me colorwise are the leg warmers i think loose socks would look better i got a really long pair of loose socks on amazon surprisingly and they are great quality good luck anon i actually just started wearing nanchatte out in public recently too
  thank you i can only improve with others help so i really appreciate it
its that time of the year again  
i thought this would be fun to see what are some cases of mistaken identity have you fallen victim to while cosplaying
on city bus to con  guy tweaking out on something sits next to me  pops the question  i dont have the heart to tell him no so i just say yes
too lazy to make a photo edit but  cosplaying malon from oot bright red hair and everything  oh my god princess zelda over here    then years later  cosplaying linkle friend dressed as link walking to 711 near con  hey zelda and link can my son get a photo with you i didnt have the heart to point out i wasnt zelda even though the kid could tell and was weirded out/embarrassed of his mom they were both normies on the street    like neither of them look like zelda malons skirt doesnt look like any of the zelda dresses link to the past being the closest but still far off
i like your ryo cosplay  how is this person so sure when there is almost no resemblance  i also got mistaken for princess tutu 3 times in that same hour
  i could see the mistake for princess tutu but ryo fuck people are dense
for the most part i can kind of understand how people can mess this one up my character hasnt appeared outside of the manga for a certain popular ln/anime franchise so not many people would really know about him    apparently though hes not so unpopular that there isnt a market for making chinese cosplay outfits of him which i discovered when searching for images for the left i guess my days as being the only one of him are numbered
   not recognizing space dandy  how and why
  i dunno escargoon sorta makes sense i could see definitely that happening
im not surprised they are a little obscure
it was halloween
cybersix
  anon who are you replying to
  im sorry anon i shouldnt have laughed but i did
  when i was ryu i got karate kid too then again he was based on him
  usually if some normie mistakes me for a much popular character and i dont want to explain where im actually from i just say something vague like its from a cartoon/video game etc
  if it was some normalfag outside a con it could happen
  carmen sandiego
cosplaying marisa kirisame  i love your taako cosplay    it was probably the big witch hat and the popularity/relevancy of the adventure zone but im a small built girl in a frilly poofy skirt ffs
wearing emiya archer with dual sword props  someone calls out hey dante  other person says no thats lancer    fantastic honestly
this happened to a friend i was with it may have had to do with the fact that i was cosplaying fate as were the rest of the friends i was with at the time when she came to talk to me
  good taste anon when youre mistaken for additional good characters its not so bad
  aside from race as a costume its pretty much exactly snipes blade
fair desu
  i know his design was heavily influenced by blade but i had glowing blue eyes
both of them happened this last weekend and both of them were parents i was cosplaying oscar of astora from dark souls  walking through con hallway  kid sees me and points at me saying look mom a knight  mom is looking at phone barely paying attention  ah yes its one of those new jaegers from the movie no  kid looks confused  smile at kid and wave  kid waves back and keeps walking with his mom  and the other one  waiting in line at store to buy a drink and food  old man around 60 comes up to me and asks me if im too a goblin smasher  chuckle a little and tell him who im cosplaying as  chat with the old man while waiting in line about various things until my turn came  we took a pic and he left  aside from that most people where straightforward and just asked who i was cosplaying
still kinda stumped by this parallel the only similarities are the hair but only really the length and colour then again the dude who mistook me is known in my comm for being a total autist so im not really sure what i expected
  what is that character from
  his name is sugita gunha and hes from the index series and hes the best character in the manga
i was asked like 5 times in the same hour if i was a sailor moon character though the hair is kind of similar to jupiters so thats fair enough i guess
most people recognized my cosplay but right as i was leaving the con two people thought i was from a really old anime/manga i didnt make the connection until they pointed it out and i also liked it when i was a weeb so i just went with it and said i was who they thought because they just looked so happy to see an older character      tfw dnangel getting a new anime feels good
  its true i had a lot of fun even if no one really recognized me just because i was cosplaying my favs
next event  star secrets 84 to 810    where to download  itunes google play store    how to play and useful guides        /cgl/ associations  gull wings  id13483  bunny baes  id11281  cgl 2  id 10830

which event set is the best to get
  so far ive noticed the giant bunny is pretty high scoring
i notice whenever i put together an outfit i always gravitate towards the same couple of hairstyles every time    post your top 5 hairstyles that you use/like the most that you own    1 magnolia scent  2 grass harp  3 wild dancing  4 elegant prelude  5 doomed doll
  for competitions or stylist arena  if its for competitions then god i love    1 piano art  2 children encounter  3 fleurs de mal    honorable mentions to claire the clown it was the first part of the set i got because damn is it pretty and to high moon from the moon chaser set its cute but my fashion sense doesnt line up with it a lot
how long will the mind control be around
  mainly competitions
  1 waistlength  2 apple pie  3 children encounter  4 moonstone  5 red wine glass    shoutout to dusk pavilion im trying to find a good coord for it      there was some comp a while back where it didnt matter what the rest of your outfit looked like if you had the fleurs du mal hair youd place high it was funny as hell

god help me but i do love the reddit melodrama better than my chinese soaps all thats missing is for someone to say theyre so heartbroken theyre vomiting blood
  restin peas
  i use messy cute constantly in a lot of events along with the hyacinth top
sheesh    this thread is deader than lunar
  i always just thought it was taninacan as opposed to actually changing your chinese characters race
  i cri evertim
  i am feeling very dehumanized because of a cartoon dress up game with a lead character whose race can best be described as ambiguous generic anime style you guys    ill accept sympathy by way of tired memes and worn out catchphrases from ru pauls drag race
finally completed rabbit of room sun after slacking off this was my first event and i wasnt expecting it to be as easy as it was desu   i will say i havent seen a complete source code suit yet  has anyone been going for multiple suits in star secrets
  its the star events third time around so i already had the previous 4 suits grabbed bits and pieces from the centaur and bunny suits but didnt feel like finishing it     i will say im pretty salty about the unlock box event format and the absolute crap prizes from anything other than the 24h box and the fact that you cant reliably get keys except by paying money for f2p you basically have 7 chances to do a 24h unlock and pray the full suit drops
  yeah i dont like the format of this one im on my last box today ive only allowed myself to buy the 99 key package each day    i also wish the new suits involved more crafting from drops what do i spend my stamina on
has anyone seen any of the items for the new association shop suits pop up in your shop ive started saving up my coins but i havent seen any new stuff since the update
  same boat here i have 6k stamina hoarded and the koinobori event suits were so underwhelming i got half a suit and then decided they were too uggo but now i have nothing else to use my stam on      nope i also have 3k assoc coins and ive been dying to use them on something
at work  phone in pocket  check on it while at the bathroom  it pocket bought the 9999 diamond pack  try to close out before it finishes loading  thank you for your purchase  google play  devs wont refund me    end my life please
  you dont have your purchases protected by a password ouch shame that didnt happen during a hell event if there is any time for a freak accident its then
  it is now but it still amazes me that my phone manages to open an app click through the loading 4 times click into the diamond buying pagewhich isnt a large or out there button in the first place scroll down to the most expensive thing and click through several more times to buy that shit    while in my damn pocket while the screen was suppose to be off
  that kind of shady shit is why i will never enter my credit card info on my phone
  shouldnt google be able to help you i dont see why they wouldnt
  not them but last time i disputed an inapp purchase with google they essentially said that theres something in the terms and conditions about how hitting the buy button in the app counts as an authorized purchase and theyll lock my account if i dispute a purchase again
next event august 14 to 20 poor quality pics from the vid    
  god more techy music suits cant they give us something original
this fucking competition theme gives me so many ideas but there aint shit to work with  muh baseball is a real game
  plan a sporting theme   see all the ruin suits  make a card games on motor cycles outfit  its shit  top 1  sell your soul anon
  iim new _
i have been dying for the new association suits so i messaged the ln facebook account because it says they typically reply in a day now i know why its an automatic reply i emailed the account and then got a reply a few hours later from a totally different email then i replied to them saying i cant use the support system because the game freezes up and then got another email that doesnt seem to be a direct reply to my reply so if yall ever have a problem good luck contacting them
  you are a hero for going through this effort    i also assumed that no one had access to the outfits
people made a new thread before the last one died  didnt even link in the old thread  didnt even put /lng/ in the title
some of the ads for this game that i find are just plain weird and wrong i also saw one that was pretending to be a choose your own adventure app
  association shop  view limitations upper left corner
  amazing storyline  kek
  omg i just got through the latest chapter and i am literally shaking omg this gaem is so dark you gaiz like all the tears rip pointless character we had no emotional investment in in a trite and convoluted storyline that is only ancillary to a cute themed dress up game111    still shook
the exchange rate in the new event is absolute bullshit
anyone know if the sari dress will come back to the shop or as crafting
  event suits takes like half a year to be craftable/buyable
  why does it matter its free now
  im flat out ignoring the event because it looks like a big load of bullshit and the suits arent worth it if free tries dont get you anything at all then its not a good event
  i was an idiot and immediately dropped 300 gems thinking its at least get me the first suit and i could move on the the second the one i want that was a huge fucking mistake
    yeah im hoarding my diamonds this time i spent a fair amount to get fox bride and would like to save up for something more worth my time than these suits that dont even look too different from the hell event with the rock star suits
  missed a few days going to be missing the bracelet        thanks since theyre doing it as a special occasion unicef thing im kinda worried lots of suits didnt make comebacks on the cn server
is it just me or have the servers been slow lately
besides i bring again this redeem code for your free accessories in our last fb super cool event in case some of you missed it  redeem code aahd22baxjsb  this redeem code will be outdated after august 30 server time  to use a redeem code go to your profilesettingsredeem code  if there is a usage limit reached error its the data traffic due to too many players processing it you might wait for some time and try again
  thanks anon
still disappointed that there can only be two people in group pics max i get why they limit that but man i had some stupid silly ideas that are now stillborn lmao
fuck the haters i am so here for frilly takes on native clothes     im brazilian and i dont play a chinese dress up game about a pink haired girl who has to save a magical world through the power of fashion styling for accuracy i play it for pretty clothes i think this is a lovely and cute take on native clothes and i am loving it    this is way more creative than the generic carnaval feathers and thong we always get stuck with    /facebook salt
  maybe post that instead of letting people be offended on your behalf  or just stir up drama for us whichever you prefer
  letting people be offended on your behalf    no need the tumblr sjw craze hit brazil hard in the past few years theres plenty of very white brazilians in that thread graciously willing to take offense on behalf of all people everywhere     i prefer just bitching here instead of dealing with triggered 14 year olds    also i just really like that redesign native clothes in brazil never really caught my imagination     when i was a kid cultural clothes from other countries always seemed way cooler than ours saris han fu kimono dirndls other countries always had these super intricate and gorgeous national clothes ours just kinda looked lacking by comparison not a lot of layering in the hot and humid ass amazon after all    so seeing this one kinda made my day its undeniably meant to be from the amazon but it just looks so dainty and feminine and dressupy its the kind of clothes i would have loved to wear as a kid i love it it made me happy     and theres no room for that kind of attitude when people are racing to see who can be the most offended
today marks the day when i completed my quest for all colourways of maidens romance    in hindsight i dont even know what possessed me to go through with this
  good job  i was going to do that eventually
  you probably used a single item that was banned by the criteria so it auto failed you
first thing that popped up when i opened redditanyone think its true or just salt
  salt reddit and fb users are all whiny babies
  figures it got deleted so fast though lol i went to see what other posts that user had and this might be the one that got them all pissy
  dont stereotype native americans  the suit is brazilian    pottery
    dont support what is clearly stereotying of native americans im 1/16th native american and this is a personal affront to my culture  edit omg i knoooow its not supposed to be native american gawd i only said that to show i understand the plight of native brazilians    yeeeeaaah sure  already bought the suit anyway it only cost diamonds that i didnt spend real money on so who gives a shit stay salty whiny rebbit babbies
  i just want the parrots and toucan desu
  mohawk iroquois  and yet she somehow didnt even do a teensy tiny bit of research to see what her people actually wore
  along the same lines i would love for more plains indian style clothing to be added to the game my grandparents are both from south dakota so ive grown up with a ton of respect and admiration for the tribes up north
okay so 600 stamina only gave me 250 petals this new stamina event is on one level with the tengu suit hell event and the outfits arent even that goodexcept for the makeup but of course it is the last item so there is no chance getting it if you havent saved stamina for weeks in advance which i doubt anyone does anyway so good luck everyone lel
  you can buy stamina with diamonds in the shop if the exchange rate is that bad i just skip this event its not worth it
what faction did you guys choose
  i keep getting this message so i cant choose any tips on how to pick or do i need to wait
  invisible blade    you pick it tomorrow
  im picking bad guys bc doctor is sexy
  pigeon forest its either the chyuunibou squad or legolas and im tapped out on dark and edgy atm
  considering picking team kimi or team reid it doesnt look like it matters except for whoever is the most popular/does the best wins which isnt going to be determined at the moment i feel like most people will either join team nidhogg or team chloris    maybe i should stick with kimi so i can be a good guy
  hot eyepatch man
  same
  it looks like everyone on facebook is either picking league till or invisible blade the league that has the most people gets the most rewards so id say pick one of those
  same here also had no clue that the demon doctor suit was actually a damn character
    ditto dont care about the actual characters or factions so i just went with the dude id want to fug the most lol
  pigeon forest because look at chloris
  isnt this the the way they expect people to choose    is there anyway to get the exclamation mark off the event icon it keeps trying to force me to look at the new miko suit and i hate seeing it i keep tapping it and checking it out but it never goes away
  i have the same problem    also are we just supposed to set a suit and hope for the best the only other thing i can see you do with this event is donate to your faction
  yeah im a little confused on how this whole war thing is supposed to go down
  laughed my ass off when i saw this outfit come up hoping lots of people are offended by it
  aw man i remember seeing this annoying group picture with this girl in a black poofy gothic dress blocking this outfit from view with the message stop using this racist outfit or something like that fuck i was tempted to group pic them and snipe at them for being a cunt honestly
is anybody else having trouble beating even the first round of the style competition in the new war event i picked apple faction ive used the guide and tried altering my outfit a bunch of times but the highest i can get is about 57k and it takes something like 63k to beat
  i just went what i could it seems it will be against other players i just wish i will get the bad ones
  im not having trouble i used the lovenikkiworld guide which did you use
  try setting some skills they dont show up in battle but it made a difference in score for me
  id imagine half the reason people are so upset is because this promo image didnt use a darker skin tone but i got this without spending a dime because i wanted the birds    i dont really understand why its that offensive compared it to real native brazilian clothes and it seems like research was done but a liberty or two to make it cuter was taken this game does that a lot is everything native not made by natives just immediately offensive now i dont get it
  i chose nameless order cuz i liked what their faction was about too bad theyre losing against league till though oh well
its another star sea contest
so why was i kicked from gull wings
  probably just an error or misjudgment just reapply
  i was kicked too for my inactivity just reapply
quick question since im kinda new to this game    how much stamina comes in each pack
  119 359 and 959 the s pack is the best deal out of them actually
  thanks 
  you can click them to see you wont buy it right away
tfw you could craft stunning beauty but you dont have enough crystal shoes
this latest update logged me out and i get nothing but errors trying to log back in which customer support line usually gets the best response
  update is still going on try again later
holy shit soon i wont have space on my phone for this game
  every single goddamn update lmao  doesnt matter how many times they post the patch times or warn you ahead of time every single time their posts get fucking flooded with these posts waaaaah i cant log in you shits
the new search feature is so much better now 
  itd help if they had an error message that even remotely hinted at this thats not too much to ask anon
  bruh they cant even write coherent instructions for most of the events im like fumbling through this detective one rn    so yes it is asking a lot
  mother of god theres a fucking separate tab in hosiery for socks vs legwear now thank you i almost cried
  only reason i go on the ln reddit desu someone always posts a comprehensive howto on events there    for real tho ive been praying for that since i realized some sock items could be layered best part of this update outside of pictured
if the star lily event told us the name of the suspects wed know who the theif is right away since they always ask who stole it in the quizzes during events    also who is this adorable thing
  from what i understand its  go to crime scene  style outfit/answer questions by clicking find clue  grind stying stages by repeatedly doing quick search  every 5 times you do a stage you unlock a witness  talk to witness to unlock interrogation question  interrogate suspects  after you unlock all the questions and interrogate all the suspects youll know who stole star lily      the quizzes ask who stole star sea lisa the suspect lady with glasses is the one who stole star sea
im so in love with the events we have going now between the login suit and the fairy tale suits its lolita heaven the cello suit is gorgeous too
the game evidently fixed the fb share for me now i dont get rewards unless i actually share to facebook cant just x out of the pop up now
  huh it did the opposite for me the popup doesnt even come up anymore and i still get rewards
  zodiac event is a bit shady with how they advertised it on fb makes you believe you get a whole suit when you dont read the fine print
  i really dont understand the zodiac pack event i saw the box that contained a random item in my tools section of my wardrobe but i only saw it once
is it worth making a facebook account for this game
  if you just want to link your account to something i think you can just use your email im not totally sure though
  you recharge 30 vip exp daily so you have to spend 099 or more per day and then you receive a chest the chest goes in your wardrobe and there you can open it it contains one of twelve zodiacthemed accessoires  its convoluted on purpose i guess       you receive like 13 additional diamonds per day if you share to facebook
  hmm seems not then thank you
  if you glitch out of your account you cant get back in
  that scared me into making one lol  thanks again anon
  56 extra stamina
if anyone here has finished their first story in the fairytale event does it take away all the bottles youve gained thus far and then give you 1000 or does it give you 1000 in addition to what you already have tp start the second one these suits are cute as hell but damn im blowing a lot of diamonds just to get the first one
  1000 extra got the first 2 or 3 pieces of the next suit immediately after i finished the first one
the new search feature makes it easier to make outfits that can actually go together and pass stages
  for a score based outfit thats incredibly cute
how in the world do i play the gym section of the crime scene event i cannot figure it out
  oh wait im an idiot and didnt touch all of the squares
it was its own independent box this whole time
finally finished up both fairytale suits and with that i think im going to take a break from this game i have some stuff in my life i need to focus on and i cant be distracted by these timeconsuming events and making sure i get my daily login rewards and all that whatnot  if anyone here is in leadership of the seagulls association feel free to unadd me from the group my player name is gigi but ill probably reapply again when my life is in a better place if youll have me back   have fun without me gulls
  that just means you have a chance to get it from that box the boxes that dont have that icon wont have the suit for sure
  yeah i ljust earned that on my last zodiac box day
anyone else having trouble equipping this suit
ahhhhh fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck   i thought id start hoarding stamina after the hell event nooooooo ahhhhhhh 10k stamina whyyy      space is a special character now apparently
  i started saving stamina shortly after it was announced for the jp server but this still blindsided me these events are getting insane
  ughhhhhhhhhhh i just want a sexy mommy yokai fuuuuuuuckkkkkkk
  i planned to start saving today and ofc today they announced the event
  kill yourself degenerate      at least these suits are worth the stamina spent i regret spending stamina on the sakuramochi event
  im grinding for star sea anyways might as well get extra pieces out of it
want to do and aquarius outfit  no water jug  its also a wasted chance to do a ganymede outfit but that would land my ass in the 90 range so fuck it ripple dress
  the water jug was like the most uninspired zodiac item i have no idea why it turned into the hive mind pleaser
  thanks anon
the event has started and i am already miffed about the hell suit being the second you can get which means my free player bum wont get it oh well
  of course the good suit will be the last you get its best to skip this event desu there will be better cloud suits in the future anyway
anyone else getting kind of pissed about practically all the new events being cumulative i know its immensely more profitable to make everyone who wants one piece to buy the whole suit but fucking christ its annoying
yeah im skipping this event i dont feel like the suit is unique enough to warrant how much it takes to get it
that typo made me laugh
has anyone else given up with the competition nowadays top ones are mostly recharge suits so i just try to get into top 20
  i cringe hard when i see those classical chinese dresses in the the leaderboard of the yokai competition that have nothing to do with the theme then there is me who tries to make a ghost resembling japanese outfit and i wont get past the 25
  ive noticed this too i did end up top 10 last competition somehow and i thought i was going pretty strong with a kitsune twist on the pragya suit but i steadily declined straight into the 30 range i spruced up my entry a little but i have no idea if itll work everyone in the top 20 are in red and white    id slap on my zashiki suit and call it there but i know itll get me nowhere when everyone wants fox mommies
    it has been getting kind of bad with that like if you arent participating in the current event or buying the latest recharge suit you may as well not even hope for a solid spot /  i had to switch my entry up a few times for this como started with a kitsune theme using the fox bride body the kitsune ears and some bits from the pragya suit which stayed around top 20 for the most part switched it up after i finished hellish bloom and this is the highest ive hit so far
pragya set made up of a few tiny barely there accessories and three mildly interesting pieces  have to burn stamina like its going out of style to get even those  fuck you if you want the posed set thats separate  fuck you if you want the hellish bloom set you gotta get through proggy first  this event is shit
  this is how every event in every game ever is like though you have to grind to get the shit prize first before you can get the better prize this isnt exclusive to this event or even ln
next event is gonna be the infamous 15k diamonds event i miss the times when we had 12 months between hell events and im growing kinda tired of it skipping it with all the power i have
  out of all the hell events they could have chosen they picked this one hope at least the evernight return is close
  yeah time to skip a shame because the mongolian suit they did for fire is kinda cool but im holding out for blood moon i need the captured elf too badly
  why are american sjws soamericacentered how can they claim to know how we feel about representation of our culture im another brazilian anon and i see nothing wrong with this
  idk about the natives in brazil but my native friends in the us do get angry about things like mascots and sports teams with racist slurs in the name misuse of regalia photos of their family being mislabeled or used as poverty porn native arts/designs being copied and mass produced sexualized images of bound and captive native girls etc a cartoon dressup game from china is really not on the radar but i guess its nice that people care its not harming anyone the way some of those other things do though
i lost my 46 arena streak opponent won by motherfucking 200 200  fuck you momo and your shit experience you were off by 20k again
  anon asks why sjws are so america centered  anon responds with idk about the natives in brazil but my native friends in the us    lmao
show me your best take on sherlock holmes then gulls the british clothes on this game are always brown and they make me laugh     is there even a deerstalker in ln
in the middle of a detective event  we still dont have a decent detective outfit  come on love nikki
i see the general user base has interpreted this theme as brown and beige with glasses
  did sherlock not wear brown and beige      how did the male work out for you any time i put a male into the contests he always ends up in the 90th percentile
  its bc most of the detective looking outfits are in those colors
heres my girl for the contest i actually really like how she turned out brown but no glasses because glasses wouldnt look very good on her
so if i go to an association with the suits already completed do i get to collect them right off the bat or do i get screwed out of them any recommendations for good associations mine just sucks honestly      like others say detective outfits usually look brown and beige but hey its fall so im down for it i did see someone with black in top 20 though the highest evolution of the socialite dress i believe actually seeing it on someone made me want it but its going to take forever
  this is super cute anon love it
  thank you shes still going strong and im happy because i need some extra crystal roses to get the shoes to silver embroidery
  so if i go to an association with the suits already completed do i get to collect them right off the bat  there is a required activity you need to have before you can claim the suits the first suit needs 300 activity which is about three weeks of being active in your new association i think
turns out theres a way to see how you rank among your fellow members to see who contributes the most to the ass suits click the suits then click sand in the upper corner
  i saw you or someone exactly like you the other day i voted for you
update
  ready for update to be finished
is anybody else having trouble logging in after this most recent update i try to log in with facebook but i get the authorization expired please authorize again and relog message
  im having the same problems as a guest player i think we crashed the server gulls
  i tried the fix button too restarted my phone and it still wont let me log in server plz
  i also cant log in anymore
  yes its still updating so no one can log in right now
  okay all should be good now i just successfully logged in
  this event is so lacklustre
north american players on facebook already throwing a fucking fit about waaaaah this event costs money       christ just take what you can get for free and ignore the parts that cost money personally im really pleased with the 10 free famtasy tickets and this adorable deerthing
  have a shit ton of saved diamonds  that saltfree life  my doctor is thrilled
what are the jade tokens for theres a lot going on and my dumbass brain cant keep up with it all
  im wondering if theyre for that part of the event that hasnt opened yet wonderland
  oh yes maybe good shout
tfw actually wanted to skip the event but decide to slurge 3000 diamonds for the first outfist event because 1 outfit would be nice to have right  of course im getting the ugliest suit  i would have been happy with everything else but i got the mongolian archer instead next time i really gotta quit the event completely
  can all of the little mascots be crafted or do you only get one
  i think only the one from the faction you picked but im not entirely sure
not eventrelated but chapter 16 has a maiden drop called tartan dress thats actually in the coats category im super in love with the idea because it lets you layer blouses underneath it love nikki please start doing the same thing with those godforsaken sleeveless lolita dresses you make
  oh well the fire lions cute
  looks like you can buy the other mascot recipes
  poised forest  no regrets
im one of the idiots thats been waiting ages for gothic furniture and ive poured a relative fortune into it already most of the time i want to complete sets for completions sake this time i legitimately want every single item
i would like to thank the academy my association and most of all momo i wouldnt have been able to get this far without you    im so happy with this event i thought the suits were so ugly and i got my least fave from the first node but now that i look at the individual pieces its super cute the pav suits are lovely too
  thanking momos smug ass  you are a better person than i and deserve your rank
hey guys i just got sword girl for 78 lu yinian because i kept failing with ranger alone but now i have it and im still only getting like no points and failing i dont understand whats wrong with it i even have the boots and legs im doing exactly what momo says for s tip and its still not giving me any points i dont understand
  is this maiden or princess theres something on your outfit that doesnt match the theme and momo should tell you at the end of that match what that is
  is that a qilin i need it now
wake up at 730  princess levels event etc doesnt reset until 9am my time  have nothing to do while eating breakfast and waiting for the bus    i mean i guess its my own fault for letting a dressup game be one of my only joys in life
  im the same i spend a lot of dia on home for someone who rolled their eyes at the first home update and said great something ill never use     my house is cute af though so no regrets
have been saving up diamonds for a few weeks as a v0 player  decide to have a look at the new war event  misread inscribe 50 cost 1500 diamonds as cost 150 diamonds  lose over three quarters of the diamonds i saved up
tfw used to play this a ton spent a ton of money quit to avoid addiction and now want to get back into it    pplease tell me im not missing anything
  competition is shit events take all your diamonds even for the shittiest suit and there arent really anything to do when you are uptodate with chapters
  on the bright side its really worth it to try to get the first node in this event since you get the pav suits plus one of the main suits and now youre a good part of the way there itll be cheap if you use your free tries
what is the likelihood of getting best boy
  order in which i got the suits  panda  flower mess  kimono girl  lolita one  best boy
  spend 20  lolita  panda  20 bucks doesnt stretch far at all
yikes
  i got him as my second drop but im guessing the chance of this happening is extremely rare
  jesus fucking christ     just uninstall the damn app for fucks sakes     this shit isnt cute or quirky    good on that guy for getting the fuck on out of there and away from that bag of crazy
41  probably going to drop to 50 or 60 by competition end    usually id change into whatevers popular but i genuinely like my suit this time potion bunny dress needs more love
i threw this hot mess together on a whim how
kind of disappointed that the wonderland thing also costs a lot of diamonds compared to other events 72 diamonds for 3 chances to vote and only getting 18 per 3 all correct votes is a little stingy    at least i care immensley more about that merrygoround suit than literally anything else this event has to offer outside of lucky bag suits
  its incredibly expensive for a voting event arent they usually like 30 diamonds for 10 chances or something
i got all the goth furniture for my house and now im back to square one of considering dropping the game only now ive dumped more money into it than i had before cant win i guess at least i can look at how pretty this house is while i wait for the new animal crossing
i just finished stunning beauty and i cant decide should i go for marionette grice or the new basass knight outfit
another sherlock holmes theme for the styling contest lame
  go for the knight join me in my suffering
someone wanna accept my association req for cgl 2 please and thank you
  its not even a different theme lol its literally the exact same theme title and everything   strange how the devs were more willing to appease people who complain about lack of skin tones than those who complain about constantly recycled themes
new competition theme finally an excuse to use my flower mirror item
is going for two of the art of war mansion suites worth it i have one and the diamonds for another but damn that is a lot of diamonds someone talk me out of it
  nayrt but im doing both rn im 92 done with grice though its killing me
what
  wrong pic or whats the problem you lost because you got less points on that round
  just the jump from 36k to 62k back down to 26k is really odd almost doubling their score im not complaining just confused
  theyre different people you get rematched after every quick attempt but only really see the first
how are the scores for quick matches calculated in the happiness event is it based on wardrobe size or highest scoring outfit in the the your history of the level
  oh shit i didnt even notice that have a doggo for pointing out what should be obvious to me
  that is a good boy
  like in the arena outfit you have is the base score and then skills your or opponents make it better or worse to get better score change your outfit or lvl up your skills the wardrobe size is just a reference how good your opponent might be
why didnt they bring back the rest of the happiness suits this round   
  wait my avatar outfit thats kinda frustrating
  no the one you make specifically for the stage why would you think it would be the avatar one
  theyre now availablethrough the event icon
  when daylight savings hits the server resets at 8am instead im assuming youre in eastern us time zone
new theme i want to see your fruity numbers
friendly reminder to resubmit your entries to the competition gulls i see posts with cute outfits but low scores all the time on here and yall need to keep trying rather than complaining about shirt scores i jump from top 4050 to top 5 with the same outfit all the time      heres mine i ended up accidentally going with the hivemind i was just really psyched to have a loliable theme
  im peeved over my lack of tall red socks
holy shit this game actually has a general thread i thought everyone who mentioned it just liked the meme ads not actually played
  were addicts
new momo request for black stunning beauty with reward of 200 dias 200 stam and 9 crystal shoes i am really tempted to recolour my set
christmas theme in the middle of horror season night before christmas anyone
millenium dream    i dont really know what to do for this one guess ill just make a dreamlike outfit and pray
  entries seem equally confused dont feel bad
does anyone else have that bug where the achievements sa one of the new event suits is completed but when you tap on it it doesnt show up
  yeah happened when i was one part away from finishing the demon suit counted for my daily activeness too
the next event seems to be pirates the animal friends this time around are extremely precious i think ill just gets bits of both suits that i like rather than just going for one loving the red hair one though    
  shit theyre both great suits luckily nothing particularly mindblowing in terms of their poses or ostensible full suit exclusive parts so i think youre on the nose here just grab the bits that you like best
maaaan i really like this new witch suit but i aint spending 20 to get it
  i used a servey app to get half that amount at least im not paying the whole thing out of pocket
  is the survery grind worth the time you have to spend on it i tried out quickthoughts the other day and those things are soul drainingly long
  no but at least the money i get there doesnt feel like real money to me it feels like getting a suit half off
new competition theme i tried going with a ghost pirate look whats everyone else doing
  i dont think people will appriciate my asian pirate
  shit looks better than my pirate ill tell you what
my pumpkin stands have no use outside of halloween but i dont regret the diamonds spent
been a while since ive hit a numbered rank after having so much trouble getting above 50 in this comp i didnt expect this getup to do very well
clumsy cosplayer  give me your worst
  my attempt
  my weeb trash       i love your anime convention wa lolita
  i tried to do a mememe thing idk i kinda hate how busy and barely recognizable to me for fucks sake it is though generic ita incoming
  i was feeling uncreative so i just copied top 20 and threw together the best miku i could i know it kind of misses on the clumsy part though
  i dont know why or how this happened i wasnt even expecting to get 50 guess itll drop later
  tried to cobble a grell we need a chainsaw in this game
  if you have the dark poem suit the crystal chopper item might be close enough
lol i went for a generic con weeb but its not going well
the next event looks pretty baller but it aint really for me ruin suits though    
is anyone in the discord for the nikkis info website if so please tell mods that they have a pop up taking users to some scam site on mobile im just trying to blitz some stages but i literally cant use the site at all and they dont seem to have a contact button maybe theres one there but i only have about five seconds before the pop up ruins everything and makes me rage quit    you dont realise how useful something is until you cant use it any more
i miss the days when you could get 1 event suit under 1k diamonds now you have to drop 2k dias for one
  what makeup is that
  nayrt but i think it came with the overdrive cycle suit it was available during some music themed event a few months ago
    its called illusion of phantom from overdrive cycle its my favourite makeup
i feel nothing
  next the evolved version and then the other colourway it never ends
did the extras from the fox bride gacha ever get added i had a ton of repeats but havent had them show up in decomposition
phone with small amount of memory  use 1/6th of it on love nikki
  ive been working to evolve it for months godspeed anon   im now multitasking and trying to get the new north outfit and its killing me inside
    star invoker interests me more than dusk and dawn this is also one of the cheaper events it seems what a relief
  are you me i had to delete a bunch of apps to install the last big update when the next one comes around i have nothing to delete left and im not sure if im ready to delete old pictures and memories from vacations and stuff
  get one of these off amazon
  addicted to mobage gf  his loss this is wife material she understands i need to grind dragalia its a two way street
  whats your might level
anyone is participating in the ny contest  my nikki isnt that good but at least im on top 14 at the moment    also im quite interested in joining an association in mine everyone except 3 or 2 of us were active the rest were 0
  i feel your association blues mine is just really sucky and kinda dead but i was the first to join and we have a star on one of our requests this means we were the first association to complete the request    but this sentimentality isnt going to get me those suits    at least my contest entry is doing pretty good so far
  we have a star on one of our requests this means we were the first association to complete the request  doesnt star mean your highes scores are from time you had a wish blessing
already got 4 suits from the evernight last time  now my next one is the 4th star i already claimed last time  is this bugging on anyone else or will i get the last suit from it
theme is a meme  no one gets it  i want frys not shopping addicts
      i was also able to finish the marionette set recently congrats anon its tough  ive decided to find peace in having just one set of each hell suit no recolours   im grinding through the last 70 pieces of the evolved grice set now averaging one drop a day ill have her by valentines  no more diamond suits to craft so im getting as many drops as i can for the newest hell suit too  stay strong collect those drops we support you
i cant figure out what to burn my stamina on anymore ive completed the story i have the starsea im working on grice but i can only grind princess so much per day theres still a ton of stuff i want to buy with my diamonds so im not wasting it to grind princess more    what else should i try to get
  grind for the next lifetime suit
  complete all nonevent craftable suits get all other colourways grind for other hell suits stunning beauty and the knight grind for decompose and reconstruct etc
  stunning beauty and the knight  this might be good thanks for the recommendation    the reconstruct drop rates suck really hard i started the game this summer and ive only gotten 2 pieces from the aurora set for all the decomposition ive done
  you get better rates the bigger batch you drop i agree its still trash
  fuck seriously so ive basically been wasting them    do different items of the same heart rating have different drop rates ive been grinding camellia branches would princess 5 hearts do better
chapter 17 and a new association level are coming soon and the suits look great im excited for that cute witch and the purple lady also cybil bennett is that you
shut up and take my diamonds    
  why do like 90 of cloud suits look the same
another new association coop suit and mines barely over halfway done with the first one damn im thinking it might be time i find a more active one
  is it one of the cgl ones id feel like a twat for leaving over that but ive been kinda thinking the same thing
  we want more inclusive skin tones  gets more skin tones  no not like that
  just leave i felt bad for leaving my first association too but the one im in now is active enough so that we finished the new suit already
   also cybil bennett is that you    im a police officer from brahms the next town over    the purple lady and the witch are cute as hell though i fucking love their hats
so the star realm event is back but you have to pay for every chance think ill just wait and keep my diamonds
when you lose your arena streak of 110 to a 40point difference  even icarus fell i guess
  no blouse no problem    no blouse socks tights headwear or any other appropriate accessories whatsoever problem
  she wore this to teach people about lolita
  dear lord
  how to start an ita thread with a bang    i just want to say that the last couple of ita threads have been of frighteningly good quality with minimal nitpicks probably thanks to halloween
  the blind leading the blind i guess
    no bra no problem
  this is genuinely frightening to me she should audition for a horror movie
  i have such a soft spot for scene hair with lolita this is a crappy dress but still it reminds me of the era when i first got into the fashion and it kinda works emo hair has that cutesy gothic feel that was inspired by vkei and early harajuku street snaps often had something similar
  looks like a normie hair style with a gothy color not scene hair at all
  its not typical scene hair but the bright colour and full fringe are reminiscent of it its definitely not normie by any means though anon also gothy colour is more like black no maybe alternative hair style would have been a better choice of words to appease the nitpickers    i tried to google for a picture i had in mind thats a great example it was posted to the ita thread at some point and some other anons were like oh i kinda like this weirdly enough but i couldnt find it
  dear god tell me thats a wig
  this is the last thing lolitas see before they die
  for a heart stopping second i thought the ice cream prop was her hand
    is she 40
  icepick murderer kei     iis this real life    oh     oh shes cute i wish someone would dress her properly
  diff anon and gothic lover here  i wouldnt say that only black is a gothy colour nowadays i think generally jewel tones in unusual shades not the typical old lady dyed hair are considered gothic scene hair i think usually goes with brighter colours like a very bold blue
  is it just the editing or did she seriously shoop herself sitting on a small ceramic decoration
poopchan counts as ita right      i am a gory lolita doll    
  have you noticed that any person that wants to educate normies about lolita is always an absolute ita that goes to the ones that appear on tv/youtube i presume its as theyre just the people who are attention seeking
  no1curr  seriously how pathetic and desperate for attention do you have to be to fish for insults like this
  god yes even just in my comm the people who always want to do lolita 101 panels at cons and who jump out to explain the fashion in detail to any passing normie who asks what were doing are always itas some are just overenthusiastic newbies but the worst offenders are the permaitas who think theyre experts they can never take criticism on their shitty panels and videos either i think it makes them feel good to be considered an authority on the fashion when they cant actually dress themselves and wouldnt get any attention for their coords alone
  please tell me this is a face swap
  without the choker it would be a cute normie outfit just isnt lolita at all
    aat least shes having fun i guess       honestly it could be worse
  judging from the dress and hair this looks to be a miraculous ladybug inspired coord bad idea anyway but that tiny face on that big head with no smile and no makeup looking like she knows its a bad idea this is why i sticker my own face sometimes
  i fucking hope to god this is a man
  she
bc being a scammer is not kawaii
  shooped on to a small decoration
  itas  lolitas without severe neurotical issues  agree to be honest
  we live in a society
  deets
  the ita pose
  wait what
  why is she staring at that teddy like she knows its fucking her boyfriend behind her back and she cant wait to stab a bitch when theyre finally alone
  cant agree more pisses me off even more when they try to go the ero approach and take out their boobs for the world to see
    scams chinese shopping services by claiming the packet was empty got caught one time also when buying second hand she insists on untracked shipping so she can say it never arrived and aim for a partial or complete refund  she always whines about how thats the only way to have a decent wardrobe
this isnt bad but whats happening with that underskirt
  that dress is so pretty and deserves better i hope she can improve     tomie phone case  god i hate hot topic for selling junji ito merch now so many edgy kids buying his stuff
  ugh this would have been so nice without those underskirts i love metas velveteen releases  the lace one isnt bad but the red chiffon one is horrid with this
  did she really admit to all of this any caps
  that wig and pose dont need any more facts to decide whether its ita
  i wanted to call sissy but it looks biologically female its like a sissy trapped in a womens body
    im sorry if this has been posted before i havent been around for a while  this whole channel is killing me
    werewolf themed lolita
  the hairy legs make me gag
i saw this on /r/lolita  what the fuck is this thing    also lel white people with dreads
  desu this is a cute normie /nonlolita/ outfit
  already posted in the last thread please dont visit this horror on us again
  i think this is in the right direction but theres a lot of problems the peeking bloomers dont go well with this theres no petti a huge problem its 2018 wear a petti the shoes dont go either she should condiser straightening her hair a bit more too or getting a better conditioner
  white people with dreads  literally nothing wrong with it well only whats inherently wrong with dreads anyway
  was there a bunch of bugs on the sewing table they move around like bugs during normal speed eew
  definitely interesting
  lolita meets 2000s wannabe emo
  this is cute
  who fckin cares about hairy legs  in b4 sorry you got posted  sorry you cant handle a natural bodily function
  taking a shit is a natural bodily funcuntion that doesnt mean i want to see a picture of it
  not that anon but why the fuck did she need to bring attention to it yes leg hair on girls is normal but there is literally no reason to flaunt it especially in a fashion coord
  as a former scene kid thats not how i remember wearing my hair back in the day i would have been embarrassed to have hair that flat you sound confused and like you were probably actually too young to remember that shit accurately
  she probably thinks its some sort of sick badge of honor
  werewolf with no tail  are those cat ears or wolf ears do better  pumpkin bag  not wearing claw gloves to give impression of brutality hidden under delicate fabrics  shitty make up  no visible moon accessories    were you even trying      nayrt but i think the showing off was more the rips and less the leg hair although who knows
  she really needs a better bra and if youre gonna insist on wearing dreads with lolita at least get some that go with your coordinates and not lime fucking green
  why do so many itas wear belts where are they getting this idea belts are a hot item in lolita
  ohhhh nooo
  she posted a close up
  it really do be like that sometimes
    this again     no one actually cares stop getting  your bloomers twisted about some fuckin hair and lets move on to things that actually make a coord ita instead of shit that is someones own personal choice to make that isnt unsanitary duh like out of everything you could make fun of the hairs my least of my concern
  right side  hit or miss
  isnt this a cosplay
  why does she look like sissy spacek in the 1976 carrie film
  is that a giant mole on her chin
  nasty mole/or infected piercing  childrens rings that dont fit  kink collar  why just god why
  are those felted dreads
  im genuinely disturbed this is so unsettling
     its a piercing though still looks pretty gross
  jesus why the fuck would they want to wear a piercing that looks like a giant ugly mole
      crossboarder gtfo
  hey so what the actual fuck is this
  yeah thanks i wasnt asking you because youre clearly schizophrenic
  no one fucking cares about you stop shitting up the thread you racist pile of shit
   im a lesbian and i also dont even know who you are  i wasnt asking you i responded to your post so people knew what i was referring to
  anon i get u wanna vent but this is not the board for that
  because why the fuck would /i/ want to have sex with you if i dont like guys
  this is the worst shitpost ive seen in my life
  her dreads look like sour gummy worms
  youve made me hate sour gummy worms now thanks
  could you at least attach a picture of an ita to each of your rants please
  i mean if its a werewolf it makes sensebut the coord is really ita regardless
  live your shit lives without me  we would love to but you keep posting you autist
                                  
  im not white and what the fuck lol
  theres no denying that this is awful but shes like 15
  this is a board for pretty dresses and costumes are you sure youre in the right place
  oh she is i just looked at the dress not her face and quickly posted it here
  now i want to know what board you thought you were on
this is why you dont take drugs
  you are a white person  try again
okay well this autist isnt gonna stop until the mods ban them so im just gonna post some itas
  all your posts are getting deleted you should probably just stop
  what the fuck is this wig
does anyone have any pick the ita shots from group photos
  like this
  that anon cares and i care sorry body hair like that makes you look like an ungroomed slob and bad grooming is ita we want groomed and polished looks
    what does ita mean        have you ever taken any drug drugs        try what again
  just grabbed this one actually anon
  how was holy night story so popular it looks like a bricabrac store printed on ham
  this is a bad angle for anyone
  that one skinny girl in the middle is like hiding in plain sight i honestly didnt see her at first sandwiched between them
    oh sorry i misunderstood i thought you meant ita group pic from meets like where they all gang up     wtf is this
  this is an absolute gem anon
  fishnet striped socks
  kuro lolita   why cant normies just call their nonlolita outfits normal clothing
  that first girl on the left looks miserable its as though she showed up to hang out in a normie outfit and they forced her to wear those weird bjd tights to dress her up
  you can tell it was the pastel queen on the right that did it to her
  yeah thanks    no need to apologise just wanted to see if i could identify the ita from a group
  is that hildekitten in the middle impressive how shes still going strong after all these years never improving even a little
  i like it it feels really festive to me  definitely not in that colorway though
      im honestly not surprised to see ny photos here
  mom can i wear lolita fashion   paying that much for a skirt is stupid i can sew one just as good
  far right is a qt but man that blouse doesnt fit busty girl problems
  oh nooooo lime green and wine red
  not to mention the illmatching brown tights on underneath
  ughhh i dont shave my legs but if im in lolita i make damn sure nobody can see my leg hair
  if you understand the need to hide it why not just remove it
  does baby lor count she used this in her lolita timeline
  the ita probably cares too its one thing to not care about shaving i often dont tbqhfam im lazy but another thing to take detailed closeups of your body hair to post online i know several people who do this and theyre all essentially daring others to comment on it so they can feel persecuted bonus points if theyre soft smol nonbinary genderkweer demiboi beans uwu
  anon ive been searching for this reaction image forever you saved my life
  amen      we want groomed looks    we stop using pluralis maiestatis or speaking for all lolitas it might be surprising for someone as judgemental as you but some of us actually dont care about what you do with your hairs as long as your coord is well done
  your presentation is as much a part of the look as your clothes or any of your accessories
  and thats why you should be clean and tidy hairs have nothing to do with that if you think keeping hairs makes you unclean please inform yourself better if you think it makes you untidy i can get what you mean but i dont agree just like long hair is not less tidy than a short bob not shaving is a preference that doesnt affect your tidiness you might not like hairs society has its standards after all and they affect everyone even people who supposedly are alternative however theres a difference between saying ew i dont like it and ew that is horrible and nobody should do that     not answering anymore btw i think if someone doesnt want to understand theres not much i can do
  its not like the difference between long hair and a short bob though its more like the difference between a matted unkempt mess and a well puttogether hairstyle
  tbf the one that refuses to understand is you  people in this thread has said theyre fine with leg hair as long as its not visible when you wear lolita lolita has a clean and groomed aesthetic unshaved legs do not apply to a groomed aesthetic we would be just as annoyed if a man wearing ouji shorts would sport hairy legs it does not belong in the look
  let it go she got posted so she will defend herself
  lol okay glad you have the bodily autonomy to make those calls anon seriously how old are you to be getting so worked up over body hair grow the fuck up we get you dont like it but maybe they like their leg hair and if they do thats like none of your business and if someone wants to show it off why do you have to make fun of it personally i dont go out of my way to show it but it can be visible from time to time lol maybe you should have done no shave november and understood why people do it because personally my leg skin got healthier after i stopped shaving    i get this is an ita thread but were here to shit on coords and desu calling herself a werewolf and having hairy ass legs like that is kind of funny and i salute her on that      in your book its not clean and tidy but again do you have the autonomy over any of us to make those decisions who actually cares the only people butthurt here are you      just ignore them anon i bet these are the same anons who were squabbling about leg hair a while back its just an annoying argument to have they wont listen youll defend your right to do whatever the fuck you wanna do with your body theyll try to call you a transtrender or speculate about you being trans as if thats bad anyways lololol then make fun of you some more
  youre making it blatantly obvious its you werewolfchan hope you get a razor for the holidays
  middle girl is serious model material  looks like liv tyler    holy night story is a fantastic print and even better its effing velveteen
  i seriously am not her but keep telling yourself that
  i think body hair does very much go with the look in a werewolf themed coord though dude
  ahhhh fuck i missed the shitshow that just happed what was it a crossboarder a troll
  damn how does this girl never improve been seeing cords like this one from her for years
  wow thats exactly how i got into lolita
  some esl crossborder who thought the ita thread was the perfect place for a racist rant that made no sense because it read like it had been through google translate a couple of times you really didnt miss anything
  shell pay for an underskirt but not a blouse
    this pic is old af her coording has improved makeup/hair not so much
      christmaskei thats my best guess    i swear ive seen this girl in other places before her plain face and that weird raspberry red wig are bad choices on top of that horrendous outfit i hope this was posted somewhere as a joke
  i cant what how is it possible for so many people to suck this hard
  oh wow what a fantastic life changing relevation you must have just made in anons life im sure shes never considered just shaving her legs before koodos to you
  ah yes the ita trend of socks over tights never gets old
  nah theres too many itas and you cant see the back row well enough
  girl on the left is the only one who looks fine someone get her away from the rest of them
  it was posted as a winner from a lolita contest last year its legit
  im convinced nobody who buys those sparkly doc martens knows anything about fashion ive seen them done wrong so many times on normie outfits and now this
  once again doc martens do not belong in lolita holy fucking shit
  koodos
  wow this is an old ass pic from my comm as in only one of those girls is still in the comm thankfully its the best one but this has got to be over 5 years old
  this girl has some nice things but shes always fucking ita
  not knowing koodos
  girl on the far right has one of my dream dresses
  the boobs on the blue blouse girl makes me cry
  all white people look shite in dreads
  every western loli in 2002
    i hate this girls piercings so much its kind of tragic since she has potential to be cute without them but she insists on tarnishing her appearance and choosing to engage in a style that relies heavily on having a clean cut appearance i dont understand why she even bothers with lolita its clearly not for her also r/lolita is a mistake needs to be fucking deleted from existence
  god bless my dumb fucking piece of shit cell carrier
      either samefag or a bunch of hairy broads i bet your coords suck as well  what is aesthetics  women can have beards
  you mean theyre not fuck there goes my next coord idea
  it was a question im interested to understand her rationale
  a contest for what best shoehorning
  is this a leaf thing the word is kudos
  itdoesnt look like a wig
someone please take this woman out of 2006     
  i dont like furries but the coord is nice and the fur stuff is not hideous neon trash like it normally is
  okay good i wasnt the only one thinking this
  shes dressed literally in all ap and she looks the worst
  i know koodos is a canadian cell carrier
  theres no way this is real please dont let this be real
  i do that when its cold outside though have been for the past decade actually the way she did it doesnt look good that said but its not ita to wear socks over tights anon
  is that scott joplin i hear
  autonomy
  lol idk why dont you show us your coords because we all know the bitchiest gulls in the ita thread are actually the biggest itas themselves
  no one mentioned the photoshopped boy in the background
  oh my god shes so hideous why does no one point this out legit like ugly stepsister
    just wait until it turns around though
  yes i do you literally cannot tell me i have to shave my hair for lolita lol there is literally no requirement for it and you can make fun of it all day long but it doesnt make me less kawaii desu
  i take it all back
  it doesnt make me less kawaii desu  that is exactly what it does
  im pretty sure the word youre looking for is authority as in you do not have the authority to tell me to shave    the correct use of autonomy would be something like this i do not have to shave if dont want to because i have bodily autonomy
sometimes i hate the people this fashion attracts
  right is giving me rita from 2 kawaii 4 comfort vibes
  lets be honest anon lor knows what she looks like shes been popular for a really long time
  people do point it out but what is she going to do get plastic surgery go be a shallow ass somewhere else this is a thread for clothes not faces
  the poorest of construction    were trying to forget     shes not anywhere near conventionally beautiful and literally everyone points that out youre late to the party anon     me too
  it looks stupid and pointless to me i live in a warm climate but on the rare occasions when its actually cold enough that regular cotton tights or otks dont cut it ive worn otks over regular fleshtoned pantyhose works just as fine lolita has so many layers that it really lends itself to cold weather
  found the newfag
  you do realize that no one is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to shave right you have the right to leave your legs hairy but people have a right to judge criticize and insult you and tell you that it looks bad and goes against the lolita aesthetic grow a pair
  is not really true we tend to judge the faces  if it were not about lor it would have been put down for her face many times a cute girl most likely would not land here even if her coord would be ugly    in the pictures here also the coord is bad flats no socks no petti ita pose no blouse a head band that does not match
  unfortunately its the least offensive thing here
  the plastic shopping bag makes it all but at least she has good taste she is wearing one of my dream dresses
  a cute girl most likely would not land here even if her coord would be ugly        
  there is no way in fucking hell that thing would be cute no matter what looks like she has a hormone issue probably taking hormones because transpukefust
  all people look like shit in dreads
  people in lolita have been wearing socks over tights/fishnets forever anon its not some new ita trend
  i like unnatural haircolours with lolita and while thats not a good lolita dress with some fishnets or lace tights and highheels this could make a cute goth outfit it wouldnt be gothic lolita and the lace on the dress would still be scratchy but it wouldnt be the worst goth outfit i want to take a seamripper to all that cheap lace it clutters the design and looks terrible
  is this a cheap milanoo dress the collar seems really messed up and the lace is terrible plus the yellow is so bright
  with a blouse tights and a wig upgrade this would be a nice basic gothic coord i dont know if this was somewhere really hot and thats why she didnt wear two of the important elements of lolita its an incomplete outfit and the wig looks cheap and unstyled but its not painful to look at level ita the worst thing for me is the heart choker its the most basic edgy girl necklace and it clashes with the aesthetic of everything else
  the pastel felt dreads arent pastel enough for the coord and shes not even wearing mint x yellow so they clash her roots/natural hair are clearly dark brown and the binding of the wool dreads is black which would probably look if she was wearing a punk outfit with dark colours but not with a super sweet lolita coord all the clips and stuff look random im surprised she didnt arrange them to help keep her braids on her head as they look like she hasnt got long enough natural hair to keep them in place     if youre going to wear visible jewellery in your piercings with lolita again match your coord plenty of facial jewellery with pastel balls available caterpillar brows and heavy winged eyeliner dont suit her she desperately needs a decent bra and the bodice of that dress is probably too short on her anyway as the high waist is across her tits she would probably be better having the dress altered into a skirt and wearing it with a plain white blouse the kawaii tattoo on one arm actually goes with the art style of the print but the greyscale one on the other clashes maybe coverup foundation     heart choker makes me think shes one of these wannabe kinky girls that claim theyre into dd/lg to seem edgy on the internet     shoes desperately need cleaned
  jesus christ
  is this bad satire she cannot be serious
  not liking hairy legs is bitchy now well im not offended over someone criticizing me because im too lazy to take care of myself  i guess you wouldnt like my coords because no visible body hair  you do you but most people wont like it because hairy women are not cute see an endocrinologist if your body hair isnt manageable or a priest if youre an actual werewolf
  halloween really is the holiday that keeps on giving
  she actually is trying to get hormones because shes genderqueer
  why is it always the huge nosed girls that wear bullrings dont they know that only makes their noses look bigger
  to reiterate what another anon said newfag alert
  its like looking into a window of 2005 this picture looks like its going to run up and glomp me
  every time i see this fucking garbage fursuit head i want to punt it into the sun this person can spend good money on brand but cant be bothered to spend the money on a decent quality head
  at least she has good taste in kpop boys tvxq is goat
  its like telling someone that the clothes theyre wearing arent flattering to their body shape theyll just be like how dare you judge a woman and shame her for her body i can wear whatever i want reeeee
  live in a warm climate   then you dont get shit to say about cold come back when youve experienced between at least 15 to 20 celsius and tell us about how much pantyhose under a pat of otks cut it   idiot
  ugh i have a fairly big italian nose and i do everything in my power to draw attention away from it
  i was excited to see what sort of a hilarious throwback clusterfuck journey shed take me on but then she suddenly started yelling at nitpickers out of nowhere bye bitch
  last time this was posted she came here to be all sassy and defend herself shit was hilarious
  id honestly like it if it was just ears and a tail
    i can see this working as a nice punk casual lolita look if it were done right     for me everything but the skirt belt top boots iffy on that and one pair of wrist bands needs to go it has potential to be of the keraesque style punk lolita if she had better coordinating skills
  as someone who lives in a cold place please love yourself enough to locate flesh toned high denier stockings     socks over tights is incredibly ita if its really 15 out youre an idiot for wearing lolita outdoors anyway
  i guess scandinavian lolitas are only allowed to dress nicely a for few short months a year then
  i dont know what parts of which scandinavian countries you have experience with but i live in stockholm and its definitely not 15 degrees celsius for most of the year here im a bit more cold resistant than most people but knit tights and a warm pair of boots will do it for me most of the winter if it gets really cold you can wear socks over the tights but you can wear short socks that arent visible over the top of the boots the important thing is to keep your feet warm
  some people are less resistant to cold than others think outside your own fucking box
    stop roleplaying like you know anything about this fashion or wearing it in cold places anon
  im getting fucking tired of anons shouting roleplayer roleplayer the moment you disagree with them    sometimes people just dont fucking agree with you accept it
  ayrt i think its hilarious how they think they are so right that if someone doesnt agree with them its either one person samefagging or the person posted trying to defend themselves but yeah i agree with you when i read something like     youre making it blatantly obvious its you werewolfchan hope you get a razor for the holidays     its time to     just ignore them    they cant even reason just offend
this was on lolita amino cant seem to find it anymore though
  i was looking to see if anyone posted this its still up on cof     im just so confused her gothic coord looks fine so what in gods name is that blue skirt the corset over the blouse why what why
  nvm it was on cof i seem to think every ita is from amino
  i mean there was this one too
  dear god
  whenever i see an ita mess im always so amazed by the lack of understanding of color cordinationand everything else
  ita mess like this    i need to learn to control read before i post
  forget lace monsters this is another level of monstrosity
  holy crap what was she thinking  lvl99 ita
  yeesh i remember when she posted this everyone was defending it
  this image looks like she was at gunpoint
  is this the final ita boss
  sure isi seriously cant believe she goes to huge lolita events in the same kind of shit
  oh yeah that face is ugly thats too bad
  i live in a cold climate wool sweater tights are priceless in the winter layering tights and socks wouldnt cut it
  no fucking way this is real
  its ever a disaster they teach people how to be itas make an army of itas to complement them and their terrible coords and have you notice that these people are always trying to sell their ita stuff too 
  oh poor ap horse that girls look like some one photoshoped her face in there    the animal print girl looks sad
  what was she even going for here i dont understand      flaring your nostrils to keep our glasses up is a bad look no matter who does it just push them all the way up and be done with it    aside from that this needs an ironing and a better petti not seeing what makes it a huge eye sore though is it just that shes fat
  i presume its as theyre just the people who are attention seeking  and thats why youre presumptuous in a lot of cases normies generally dont have the same bitch fits as gulls do so theyre perfectly fine with just doing whatever
  are you looking through archives to get your content this pic looks like it could have been posted a decade ago i recognize this girl from egl im almost completely certain it was posted a decade ago
  nayrt but i recognize her too i want fresh itas not old stuff
    not looking through any archives just posting what i personally think looks most awful ill see what i can find thats fresh though
  she has decently dressed friends i dont think theyre great friends if they see her wear this shit and not help her with crit  if youre going to wear ita shit then dont post it online publicly   sure youll get efamous but for the wrong things like plum chan
  the gothic one is fine until the shoes/legwear but even then id consider that a nitpick at that point  this however  is some fucking high octane concentrated ita
  video unavailable  shit now ill never know why other anons said it was unbelievable
  im so disappointed i missed out on this
  nitpick       yikes now this is ita
  it was a woman that looked to be at least in her mid to late twenties wearing what looked like a truly horrible attempt at a wa lolita outfit complete with a pink selfmade maxipad head dress and hello kitty patterned fabric  she started sipping tea from a mug kinda imitating how the cups are held in japanese tea ceremonies at this point i was still of the firm belief that she was joking  she then goes on to talk about all the lolita substyles like she was some kind of expert at this point i realized she was serious and gave the video a thumbs down and closed the tab
  can someone ban her from corsets
  that cheap shiny sissy dress fabric makes me want to kill myself
  i know this girl this is her first ever coord
  annabelle joker cosplay
  use a mirror site next time anon
  this ive never seen a single person who looks good in dreads its even worse when white people wear them or when people dye them
  welli like her shirt
  kkowai
  it almost reminds me of like those 90s/early 2000s music videos where they were trying to make everything overly futuristic meets extreme level ita
  ty anon
    not original anon but sometimes im just browsing and come across super old shit and im like yep its ita thread time     this is nextlevel ancient though
the skirt is from hot topic apparently
  she looks cute with this normal makeup imo
    holy shit i know this person from my comm
  wait so this isnt someone who discovered lolita 3 minutes ago and raided their closet
    she apologized and some how managed to turn it to a woe is mevid
    nope shes been in the comm for about a decade
  sounds like youre the idiot  get a fucking heater
  she should probably style her hair and put on some makeup
her tumblr url is lolitanotita oh the irony
  those big ass stacks of boxes   worlds most hideous wallpaper  random shitty unframed posters of game grumps and one hit wonders   random inuyasha  plushie  i think she needs to fix her room before making an apology videoalso damn the 2006 vibes are incredible shes even got that horrible early 2000s dye job
  the face and/or makeup are unfortunate but the outfit seems nitpick at best      are those blue straps her bra
  just gonna shove a whole goddamn heater under my petti like its nbd
  she did not get it at all  no one was hurt its just annoying when someone is spreading misinformation about something you do and being such an idiot about it what kind of research did she do watch 2 trashtv reports  there is an active community but she would even fail to get to that because shed probably approach some  lolita fans at an anime convention and call it a day lolita being thrown in together with gamers anime and cosplay annoys me so fucking much
  yeah its a stupid fucking carrier for poorfags
    isnt this sailorearth
  can i speak to a manager blotchy hairdye edition
  i agree why sharpie eyebrows now
  other than that absolutely hideous makeup its not a horrible first attempt
  get a heater for your house  what the fuck are you doing going outside in lolita when its 20 outside  you dont see me going to the park in lolita when its 110 f hell if anything i have more of a reason to complain than you since lolita is a lot harder to wear in the hot than in the cold  but i dont complain i suck it up and only wear lolita to indoor meetups in the hotter months
  that dress is so big on her that it looks like shes wearing a nightgown but other than her heavy hand with the blush i dont see why this is ita
  this is pretty okay though and tempest is cute
  i like that shes not pretty she is cute without being pretty and that makes a less than attractive gal like me feel more ok with myself
  oh please no
  this is so cute i love it its like shes a dark haired cherub the colour palette she used looks sophisticated but modest
  agreed the blush overkill is bad but take that out and this is a nice look
  how do you look like that for this long
  the pattern of the fabric looks very craft store to me but otherwise i agree with the other anons its not an eyesore
  newfag
  maxicimam exists to save boleros from this torture
  if youre going to go to the trouble of making a handmade dress why wouldnt you make one that fits i think the cut is really cute but the fact that its so oversized and the fabric makes it look like a nightie
  looks like a good otome/toned down lolita coord to me colour balanced too
  good  i wouldnt call it ita but its pretty bad anon it looks very budget because of the normie cutsew and dowdy shoes and her hair and makeup are drab/washed out    she looks kind of dumpy naturally so shes gonna have to make up for it through effort moreso than someone slimmer and cuter would
  trying to mimic a very pristine hygienic polished and groomed fashion from the victorian era    but if you judge me for visible body hair youre a fascist or some shit

previous thread 
  compare this oldschool short skirt hem with bloomers classic combo with aps trend towards longer dresses
  i love these desu i think they have a natural kei vibe that i see in very oldschool lolita like op i just wish there wasnt that nasty lace on the bottom
  but moitie and even iw have had ankle length dresses for decades why all of a sudden are people shitting their bloomers over ap finally hoppin on the bandwagon
  theyre probably newfags t b h
  one more image to show the other cuts / colorways of the center jsk in the pink/grey colorway       i remember the longer stuff but i feel like this is more gunne sax inspired than lolita but longer
  i like the longer dresses because i feel like these can be worn outside lolita more easily but these look like nightgowns to me  i really liked the thing they did with otome no tutu doll though
thanks for the heh youtube
  longer dresses are still rare and desu these are ugly they look like bad gunne sax knockoffs that minanoo would sell the silhouette of a long dress is genuinely different from pairing a knee length dress with bloomers so to act like those are the same its silly    i think occasionally longer dresses suit classic and gothic because the silouhette is more mature the dress design is more toned down but and usually is acompanied by minimal poof
weird request but do you gulls know of any cottoncandy coloured tartan dresses like pic related but with blue/purple as well as pink
  everything that vm makes is a masterpiece   im crying so bad theyre closing down
  its possible they might not be i seem to remember they had a booth at a con recently and the closing wasnt a 100 sure thing according to the reps that were there
  please dont give me this hope anon  well either way im gonna cry hard  from sadness or relief
does the dream sky mto run out when it sells out or is there a date it ends im talking about the one on ap usa
  they were at hyper japan in london a couple weeks ago and apparently some lolitas asked them if they were actually closing and they said they werent sure there is hope but they didnt really sell a lot at hj so /
  i didnt go to hj but i saw the dress they brought not sure whether they brought others as well and although i usually like vm i wasnt a fan of that one perhaps it was a bad choice or maybe its only me
  click here  they did have a few nice regimentals but most were the old floral prints yeah
  made to order items dont sell out thats the entire point of mto there is of course a time limit to making reservations did you look at ap usas site for information
  why dont the hijab lolitas just wear these instead of ruining the look with pants
when the heck was this released and how did i miss it
  before halloween  
  ap has a lot of pastel tartan
  ugh that cut is ugly as sin though
  its not ugly just unflattering if youre chub
    who tf is out here selling buttons for 20 bucks
  i was trying to compare how a lot of lolitas think the short skirt/visible bloomers look is also not very lolita like how people are talking about aps new long dresses meaning how going to either extreme creates / brings out a lot of strong opinions within the community      i agree i like the skirt hem to float somewhere above midcalf if its two long it starts to take on too much of a historical vibe instead of a modern look inspired by history      exactly i hope they pick these dresses it
  afaik  i wasnt there they brought the lacy afternoon series and the matching frill bonnets classical doll and the matching bonnets royal lacy doll ops rococo bouquet both the previous release and the upcoming one and i think matching bonnets for some colourways also the handbags they released earlier and the purple underesses sold in feb this year       the rococo bouquet jsks were sold as an early release at hj theyre putting it up online a bit later what gives me hope that they will remain open is that they mentioned those dresses will be shipped around feb to march
  lmfao and its only 2 of em
  i did but i must be missing it pic related is all i saw
  only if we can start calling you crabbypants mcchickenlegs
  nayrt but its pretty ugly not everyone likes what you like bb
  sounds good lets go
  not everyone likes what you like bb  that goes for the original reply where it was stated to be ugly all these opinions are subjective and yall are never gonna agree on this
ive always wondered      are cutsews generally very short on the torso just because its assumed youll be wearing a skirt high up enough on your waist that it wont matter or are japanese girls torsos justa lot shorter
  i think its assumed your breasts will be very small thus youll need to lay a certain way
  theyre definitely short in order to be worn with skirts that sit at the natural waist without the need to be tucked in
  lolita fashion got censored on tumblr again    is there a new site we can go getting real tired of tumblr going on a purge every time a light is shown on their sex dungeon
  new site  well youre here already
  censored as in the tag   it baffles me that there is such nasty depraved shit on that website and they think that blocking a word will make it go away i wish it was that simple
  yes if you search for lolita fashion or look in the lolita fashion tag youll find nothing supposedly if you include the tag or the name lolita in the description/text of a new post your post wont appear in search      girls are taking to using alternative tags but you can always just use instagram
  they blocked literally all tags that are or hint at nsfw no matter if you have safe search on or not a few days ago they also randomly mass deleted blogs that rightfully tagged their own post as nsfw   they say it was a mistake but im pretty sure they plan to purge every adult content off the site to please the advertisers someone on /g/ who said they worked for the staff called it back in august weirdly enough all of this happened in the same time 4chan split for the same reason
where are the secrets
  i wish they would stop using this terrible wig the curls look like weird penises its so offputting
  the admins are retards full stop theyve been censoring anything remotely diet related for years and when it gets out the site is full with child porn they start censoring clothes     everyone is worried about toddlers getting raped by monsters in human skin and here the tumblr tards are patting themselves on the back for a job well done taking down frilly fabric related shit
  too little too late they should work on cooperating with interpol to get every last pervert on there arrested instead of just rug sweeping and harassing users who never posted shit like that
  its a secret
who is hbj
    both its this  so the cutsew will definitely be way much shorter than tshirts or other blouses ideally theyre just long enough to cover the waistbands on skirts and then stop there    but additionally their major clientele is japanese or chinese lolitas western girls just dont spend enough buying firsthand japanese and chinese girls mostly arent all that tall either most are below 160cm so the cutsews are sized for that height
secrets
whatever happened to blmchan
  shes a stripper now  black liver matter
  theyre not censoring clothes they purged all nsfw tags and theyve always counted lolita as a nsfw tag thanks to the book so bye lolita tag    tumblr has sucked for years and i dont get why so many lolitas still use it
  those people dont pay attention to any brand besides ap because ap has bigger sizing and has pockets
  i have tiny breasts im only 161 cm tall and i have cutsews that are too short to wear with normal lolita skirts
  ngl i wish iw would add pockets too a lot of their more toned down stuff is great for work but the lack of pockets is such a nuisance
hello beautiful    wish the jsk came in royal blue instead of just ivory
  i really dislike ankle length in lolita in other fashions if worn without a petticoat i dont mind but not for lolita
  somebody please wear this with shirley temple style hair and be heidi for a meet
  the fuck are you talking about no one posts their coords here
    ap is the reason behind it here is the original ballgown release from way back when the old post on egl shitting on the length of the dress among other problems is probably still up one livejournal somewhere the general consensus seemed to be that it looked too much like a ballgown and not lolita with the skirt actually hitting the floor         and  are ankle length the middle and left dresses in  actually reaches the floor the dress on the right actually does not youre way too careless picking your dresses were lolitas after all we debate the difference between your skirt being two fingers above your knees ideal and being halfway up your thighs trashy how are people expecting us to completely gloss over the differences between anklelength dresses and floorlength dresses of course its a huge deal whether a dress is ankle length or floor length how are you going to debate the importance of quality on a 1inch strip of lace when you dont even care that one dress is a whopping 10cm longer than the other and hits your body at difference places     is even the same model as  showing you that the dress being ankle length vs being floor length is intentional and not just the model being short i feel like if shes simply too short they wouldnt show her full height anyway so i think its intentional to show you the dress is really long
  lol just noticed also the hair is fraying a bit in the back isnt this wig from like 2011
  ap is the reason behind it  tell that to my 2001 floor length vm and moitie
    different anon but are they truly floor length which pieces are they im definitely curious    i regret selling my ankle length vm dress made me feel like a legit edwardian lady
  hello bones jones thats the only acronym i can think of that would be related to this board
  sorry no photos i feel like if i posted i would out myself here im only 53 which is average if not on the high end of average compared to japanese standards so its not like im very tall or short compared to the body that most brand is made for it may be closer to egl/ega but floor length isnt new its just not incredibly common   also i dont get why anon above thinks ap is so innovational and groundbreaking especially because that was an aha collaboration which most collins at the timeespecially wit ayas were borderline cosplay anyways not that its bad but brands especially ap have all done a lot of weird wacko cosplay collabs before pic related
  worn photo too   meta is usually sited most but i love aps wacko non lolita shit best desu
    anon above here its not groundbreaking     between the aya dress and the gone with the wind cosplay dress floorlength dresses were always complained about even moitie would have anons insisting you prove that it was sold in the lolita and not aristocrat section of the webshop vm dress would probably get the same treatment as the mermaid skirt iedebated and complained about    now theres a 180 degree turn with people apparently thinking its totes normal now you dont find that odd i couldve made a floorlength lolita dress two years ago and be told its not lolita exactly because its floor length but ap makes one now and the reaction is r u high this is normal lmao    the person posting anklelength dresses and then conflating them with floorlength dresses is their own class of not paying attention though that has to do with lack of attention to detail than groundbreaking
find dd on fril for good price   seller has 2 colors listed on the same listing so you have to comment what color you want  other color is sold out  color i want is still up  send info to ss via their form  ss says item is sold out  email them that it must be a mistake  they tell me to resubmit via the form again  resubmit and stay up until 2am waiting  same issue  send angry email showing how its clearly up and people are asking the seller questions  no reply yet    fuck this unfrilly gay earth
  the taobao gwtw dress was very much a cosplay not lolita no one is saying its normal and happens all the time people are saying its not new and not groundbreaking is it going to be trendy now maybe rectangle headdresses have come back to popularityin their own way and even old school/traditional lolita has made a resurgence however again it isnt new and ap isnt doing anything new or groundbreaking its an updated version of something tried and true its just using the new trendy material like chemical lace chiffon and tulle compared to the cotton and pintucks of the past but the length itself is not new
  use an actual good ss
  like which
  i feel like if i posted i would out myself here  youre not the only person who owns 2001 vm and moitie stop already youre not special and no one cares who you are
  nayrt but why so salty i dont post my own photos here either because my room and wardrobe is easily recognizable and i have too many drama hungry teens in my comm who think their hot shit for posting of 4chins and i dont want to attract their attention positive or negative
  because im tired of convenient ass arguments no shit anons are chicken shit who wont post why else would they be anon    are you too stupid to work a camera that you dont know how to take a picture of a dress without showing all of your fucking room
  convenient ass arguments  welcum 2 4cn
  right why even talk about how you wont post your personal stuff then so useless
  because posting identifying photos makes you not anon
  ass arguments  no ur butt
  lolitas use it because facebook sucks and lj died
  i already said this but youre too dumb to read an entire post    you can take a photo of a dress without showing where you live you fucking numb skull its ok youre too fucking stupid to do this properly even if you really do have the dresses which you dont
  were all paranoid apparently
  ffs lay it down on a plain bedsheet or hang it from your curtain rod after throwing a bedsheet up on it or keep lying your ass off
are these replicas anyone they look really iwish to me lurkin doesnt show much so i cant prove that
new meta release   queen flocked asymmetry frill dress  45800  opens november 30
  not being able to identify a lolita by her wardrobe
best place to find a wig styled like this
  most likely replicas the original is probably something like liz lisa
  you cant identify someone from one single dress you jackass
  more like anons love to roleplay like they own so uwu rare pieces and then pull the but cgl is meanies card as soon as you catch them in a lie
  that blue green color is amazing and i adore metas flocky stuff      anon mentioned more than one dress stop being a dick outing herself would most likely cause major issues in her comm its about dress length not anything groundbreaking that an anon would need to lie about
  shes not the only person who owns vm and moitie cgl may have some dumb ass anons who think they are l33t interweb detectives but theyre not if they were wed of identified hwc  quit being so fucking gullible
  wasnt there a good guess about hwcs identity though
  which was also no one actually idd her it was still just a guess
  semi unrelated but i thought this outfit wasnt released to the public
  nayrt but a few years back someone posted a photo of their dresses hanging in their closet and i was able to identify them despite never being in their house or seeing pictures of their room she was a shit stirrer so once she was outed she flounced from the comm its entirely possible and incredibly easy to identify people by which dresses they post
  ive posted my wardrobe here and wasnt identified we all have anecdotes seriously doubt we can id anon from a single moitie piece or vm pretty sure anon was lying to win an argument and then conveniently covering their tracks
  just because no one posted your name or called you out in that thread doesnt mean you werent identified
  its entirely possible and incredibly easy to identify people by which dresses they post    so uhm if someone asks for proof what you gonna say if the dress conditions are good and the dress is on a solid colour blanket i doubt you can say anything
  i bet that anon will be first to back off or post other peoples pics when it comes to wardrobe posting i know this kind of hypocritical twats who encourage people post their personal stuff while using every opportunity to stay anonymous i happened to know such bitch personally do not eat this bait gulls
  im sure people who worry about being outed on cgl dont post sales on cgl
  proof your theory anon post your wardrobe and let us guess
  upd picture with time stamp in raw
  i could probably post a dress with me in it and people still wouldnt have the slightest idea about who i am
  fuck off metaposter
  shush santa wont bring you anything if you keep behaving like this
everyone lying and playing like no one can be idd are definitely the first to post shit like  well its known x posts here so insert bitter hatred
im the original asker but if anon feels uncomfortable no need to dogpile her geez i get it     we should have a long length lolita thread though
this kind of behavior is why people are embarrassed or ashamed to be associated with cgl in the first place
  this kind of behavior is why people assume everyone who posts here is a shithead so
  go to the stupid questions thread
  this looks like bodyline shit tho do better ap
is it true that the kinkiest of us are often those who look the most cute and proper  it might be kinda lolita unrelated but i noticed that my friends into a more classic kind of sweet or simple sweet were often reaaally kinky  im probably speculating thoughim sure there are gothic lolitas and ott sweet lolitas that are super kinky too
  no what the fuck the only thing joining all lolitas is a desire to wear the frilly shit what they do in the frilly shit differs majorly between people maybe you just happen to have friends who are all into the same stuff doesnt mean all sweet lolitas are
  i too think it is a coincidence
  correlation does not equal causation ott sweet and incredibly kinky elegant gothic and too vanilla to even hold hands mature sweet and mildly kinky we come in all sorts
  oops meant to reply to 
      yup thats what i thought just found it mildly funny to think about but thats for the best that it isnt trueor else lolitas would face even more weirdness coming from thirsty men because they would be seen as easy to fuck or some bullshit
  nayrt but fuck you
  let people like things you autist
  metaposter is based go away
  i masturbate once every 2 weeks and have never kissed a boy very kinky
gonna move to the us  no more neetbux or living with parents with 250 to spend on myself every month  probably will have to start with a minimum wage job given itll be my first job  dont know how long itll be until i can afford lolita again   i dont want to live paycheck to paycheckbut if i wanna live with my fiancée i need to do it shes already burning out working 50 hours trying to afford everything so i gotta help her    how do you cope with being a poorfag/having a long time period where you cant afford lolita gulls im scared to fall into depression again with all the money related stress were gonna face as i search for a job and i used to cope with muh anxiety by shopping online  i meanim gonna survive not buying frilly dresses but damn its gonna bum me out
  hawt
  another kissless virgin here and i do it once every few days i also wear a more classic kind of sweet or simple sweet as anon described interesting observation but i dont think theres a causation relationship between kinkiness and looking proper or viceversa
  window shop instead of buying take out your dresses and look at them or rearrange them when you think about buying more lolita plan new coords etc
  wish i hadnt bought 3 hls this year this is great but i dont need more flocky
  already been asked both there and the wig thread lately with no good answers there is a really ita weird orange pink one on taobao and thats all i can find
woah guys you can upload gifs to lm listings i just saw one while looking through the new listings its blowing my mind
ive been wanting to get into lolita recently and have been looking at a lot of dresses on lacemarket but theyre all seemingly too big for me my measurements are bust 80cm waist 70cm hip 88cm im 161cm all the dresses im seeing have larger bust and waist measurements than i do am i doomed to have to adjust all my dresses
haha oh boy here we go poop chan got featured in on the look
  kek shes already being roasted in the comments called a toshi rip off ten minutes in
  who is poop chan girlypoot
  look in the comments there are mad deets of her past endeavors
  if it was so dire then how come nothing happened
  you just have to deal with it accept that you had it good before enjoy the dresses you already have and try to coord them in different ways learn to bargain shop learn to buy only the dresses that truly make your heart flutter and let go the flavor of the month these days there are a ton of cheap 100 and under lolita main pieces on lm
  what brands are you looking at if its ap theyve been trending bigger for quite awhile and has been releasing a lot of sack dresses with massive measurements also remember youll want 5cm ease for breathing and blouses and corset lacing can take stuff in a couple cm if its just a bit large
this whole fb thread is too good
what events other than sfe are there for next year i want to fill up my calender so i can stop being sad that i missed out on it
  learn to craft or sew and work on your wardrobe in smaller ways make some really cool and unique accessories good luck anon
  i was looking mostly at ap and baby they have a lot of nice designs its a shame to hear that ap is getting bigger like that but you gotta be inclusive i suppose i wasnt aware of the 5cm leeway or adjustable backs thats actually really good to hear ill probably just buy a dress to test the waters and compare it on my body before buying more thanks for the tips anon
  paradiso
  older aatp runs small and if the piece has corset lacing and waist ties its easy to make it fit decently as long as its not one of the bigger new releases vm and mm with corset lacing might also fit you
  im super poor in terms of this fashion with the exception of 3 dresses every brand item i own was bought during the sales accept you probably wont be getting any of the major releases and try to get creative with what you can snag lolita doesnt become less fun when youre not getting something new every month
  check for lacing many dresses have corset lacing in the lack which can significantly tighten them
  okay then i will share the secret with you there is no perfect place to find this exact wig because these have been worn and styled and if you want the exact same thing you have to style it yourself  try bodyline no lie get the long twintail wig and a short bob wig and put them together ive seen a few girls do this or arda or dreamholic or epiccosplay or go down the taobao rabbit hole by figuring out search terms and clicking through listings you have also given us three different wigs to find for you look at them there is a hime styled wig a fluffy curls wig and two twintail wigs which one do you want ugh stay in the stupid questions thread
  not a problem anon     baby tends to run a bit smaller than ap and the older the dress the smaller its likely to be no matter what brand it is just as another tip im not an ap fan so one of them could probably give you more fit details for baby/aatp stuff from around 2010 should fit you fine early 2000s might be small     having a few cm of wearing ease is really important and variable depending on the cut but 5cm is a good estimate you might find you prefer more or less as for corset lacing and the like you can get a few cm smaller with corset lacing and waist ties but not much more before it looks really strange and bulky in back trust me if youre concerned about fit and new start with a jsk maybe theres a lot of ways jsks can be altered and its much easier than altering an op
  heres the secret buy skirts they have smaller measurements and brand blouses are made for your bust
  nyart but all of them
  i thought japanese girls had long torsos relative to the length of their legs
  then do as anon advised
  go get a wig thats close enough and style it yourself dumbshit
  get the long twintail wig and a short bob wig and put them together  ntayrt but what do you mean put them together like on top of each other or what
  really put on the short bob wig and clip in the two twintails they have claw grips
  key word here is relative
going to japan at the end of the year   want to get some real lolita cords   any shops you can advice  also thinking of buy and sell some pieces any ones you guys think might make me some extra cash for my trip
  point proven
  cords  lovely  what brands do you like check on their websites for locations and visit them in store if their prices are out of your budget look into visiting closet child and other secondhand stores with brick and mortar locations like maiden clothing    thinking of buy and sell some pieces  what do you mean by this if you want to try to make money off of selling lolita clothes then please dont our secondhand market is relatively small and already has notorious scalpers no one wants this
  reselling from cc  lol i can only imagine they rarely have good deals compared to usagiyouhinten when they were active and other jp shops only good compared to freaking ww
  usagiyouhinten    cries it was my favourite secondhand store and i bought my first lolita dress there i was genuinely sad when it closed down    btw is cc stuff overpriced i thought it was okay
    cc stuff can be decently priced online depending on what the item is but they have much better deals in stores
  im going to wear lolita until im a wrinkly old grandma 
why cant we announce reports and sage on this board i tried searching about this rule but coudlnt find an explanation specially for sage      also stop spamming this same old bait on every thread no one cares
  get this bait spammer of the board already its boring  report male posts
  i think thats a global rule back in the 2000s people would shit up entire threads just announcing sage sage sage to force a post into autosage like fucking idiots     the nice thing is /cgl/s janitors are really on top of things in recent years reported stuff rarely takes very long to disappear i wish more people knew to do it
  it was a form of selfmoderation reminder sage goes in all fields
    i think the problem here is that anon doesnt realize what those wigs look like in back bobtwintail has always looked like weird trash because thats not how hair works     anon whos looking for a wig like that  you want a chibi from arda or similar pigtail wig plus two prestyled claw clip tails but youll still have to do a lot of work yourself to make it look halfway decent if you need more handholding than that go to the stupid questions or help threads this is pretty basic shit
  in theory ya in practice it was spam
  what went wrong with closetchild i remember they used to have pretty decent prices a few years ago and their update schedule was really tight now the online shop seems to update whenever they feel like it and the amount of lolita vs other stuff is pretty small
  its not super overpriced but in my experience i always end up having to sell for less on the western market when i get things on cc that dont work westerners are too cheap to pay 150180 for less popular prints and 3035 for matching headbows
  i have no idea but its disheartening to see not to say that its the only source for good secondhand lolita but there was something exciting about going on cc when the scheduled update went up and snatching up the good finds before anyone else  oh well
  no look at the thumbnail does that look like k8 to you
  ohh you made it sound like 2 entire wigs not just a bob and some claw clip extensions
  wow this is creepy as shit dude
  well who is she then not everyone knows about all the drama
i just got my first meta dress and oh the construction its beautifully made when was the last time you were able to say wow this piece is just so well made it deserves to be priced at 300 etc tell me your stories im just happy
anyone else having problems with lady sloth     i ordered from two separate reservations and wanted to combine the shipping she said no biggy i didnt get tracking and messaged her pic related
  hope this gets solved please do keep us updated    ive never had problems with ls before but ive been buying mostly through lm with them       my last time was when i bought an oldschool piece from moitie and besides it being made of polyester the construction of the peiece was flawless the lining the lace everything was so on point
    just got an email looks like they just shipped it a few hours ago     so i like ordered these two things in july  aug they sent me a final payment paypal request in oct which is usually what they do when the items are ready to ship i paid immediately and heard nothing for a month start of the pic dm still hear nothing messaged again then i got a paypal request to finish paying which i already did  i canceled the request and sent and email no response then got that message yesterday which i think is a total bs made up reasoning for not having my items shipped i guess i just got lost in their messed up system of ordering    even though i like their designs a lot i think they just put too many out too often and thats why more order got lost in all the confusion     good thing i was on top of it and kept messaging them
  honestly when i became too poor to afford new dresses i ended up having a lot more on my mind distraction works wonders you will be distracted by your new job and your new life and making new friends etc plus you already have your existing wardrobe you wont missing getting new dresses too much honestly
when i have money to spend  no dresses i want online  when i dont have money to spend  all my dream dresses are up for sale
  same anon
  same always happens that way for me
  other than your waist those seem like good measurements youll be able to fit into pretty much any ap or baby dress you want some skirts might be too small though
  god shes so fat  the definition of white trash
  when its lucky pack season and i have money to spend  countrywide postal strike and massive international mail delays
  your best bet is to buy a normal twin tails and follow a hime gyaru twin tails styling tutorial i dont think youll have much luck finding that volume elsewhere
really specific question but does anyone know of any blouses with very puffy 3/4 sleeves im talking huge puff
  sissy costume stores
  1980s formal wear on ebay
  i was very lucky and got my spooky macarons jsk early but it looks like most people didnt get theirs until after halloween i think she just mishandled the preorders theres no reason people should be getting a halloween dress in december
  im very close in measurements to you anon 81 bust 66 waist 91 hip 167168 tall and when i started i had the same fears of things being too big but when i bought my first ap dress it fit just fine no alterations like someone else said your blouse will actually play a large part in bulking you out on top of your bra just going to assume you wear one corset lacing is your friend and can make things snap more to your body waist ties will also help with your waist but by no means would dresses be falling off of you without these i even fit into fully shirred jsks like magic princess toy parade and melody toys the only problems ive had were with ops being too large in the chest and waist so sometimes they look a tad baggy
  i feel like ive entered 2007 meta looking at this dress i love it
  for reference  80cm bust 60cm waist 90cm hips 43cm shoulders 165cm tall anon here    the brand ive tried   vm this is the brand i have the most experience with good fit sometimes loose on the waist sleeves are just long enough an offshoulder jsk didnt fit because it was too big t_t   mm good fit    meta slightly too big not only on the waist but also on the chest and shoulders not too noticeable though    shirley/etc perfect fit almost tight on the shoulders   ap good fit   btssb good fit    bodyline some dresses in m size are too small and a little tight on the chest other than that good fit
  you meant to say your shoulders are 33cm wide right
from boz
  i have different measurements 92 bust 72 waist and full shirring is awful at my size the best i can hope for is quarter shirring in bigger dresses like baby has sometimes full back shirring dresses dont come far enough around me in front the shirring is visible on the sides fuck meta ap is better but i still prefer quarter shirring in larger sizes and their quarter shirring is usually on the smaller side
  3 hl   jesus christ woman are you trying to catch em all or something
  in europe theres modern doll fest in august and a ton of 3f teaparties in france and italy
  i was thinking whether i should go to the 3f tea party or not i have never bought firsthand lolita and i dont think i can afford something especially with the event and moving costs is it worth it if i go there and cant buy anything even if i enjoy myself in the end it would just be a money loss / ughgh
  i bet they did fahr i bet they did
  depending on the skirt they might be too small for a 70cm waist though i have a 65cm waist and tons of skirts but many of them are quite snug especially older ones
apologies in advance anons i would post this in the online communities thread but its past bump limit and there isnt a new one yet     what is the general opinion of the lolita amino as in how is it as a community compared to the facebook groups im thinking about giving it a try but ive never used amino before so i dont really know how it works and if its worth the hassle i know a lot of itas seem to hang out there and provide material for the ita thread and there was some drama related to it that was talked about in the tail end of the last/currently still up online communities thread but is it actually alright as a platform and community
  last i checked it was full of literal 13yearolds and the drama youd expect from that demographic but that was at least half a year ago
  that drama i mentioned revolved primarily around angry 12 year olds or something so that sounds about right still unfortunately i had a scroll through the content and it seems like its primarily coord posting cof lite
  i swear i have seen either atpie/sheglit/excentrique release some maybe even physical drop ill try to find some current listings for you
  i check it daily but dont post anything i literally have 0 online presence except for 4chan    its a lot of itas like a lot however there are enough older and experienced lolitas to give constructive criticism where its due its not all asspats  more than id like but less than youd expect    the mod team went through an overhaul recently and basically the oldest and most active members became mods and they do a good job of keeping the place clean spam/kinkshit/literal 12 year old asking dumb questions get removed instantly
    so i found this by sheglit but its probably not as dramatically puffy as you want youre going to want to search through the outofthebox brands like alice auaa visible gloomth very hit or miss or some taobao shops like surface spell gothic and amastacia  you could probably commission an indie brand like elegy to make one for you  i hope this helps
  i really liked it since it first came out and the orange and teal were just so perfect in addition to the normal colors chose my favorite of the older colors
i think you guys might like that manga  
  its pretty lackluster as far as being a community i hate that its mobile only its mostly 14 y/os and the chat feature is useless bc its 14 y/os the only good lolitas just cross post from their fb or insta to it
  is anyone working on a translation yet
  orange and teal  based
    oh my heart someone please translate itsounds like a wholesome story
i thought it would be fine to sell to people who do not yet have feedback but holy crap  these buyers dont even attempt to read the rules are even sellers terms of sale before buying ive had to relist 2 items so far and possibly 3 soon if this current iffy one keeps ignoring messages and not paying
  why the fuck would you even try to sell this trash on lm looks cheap not lolita and youre bitching
  thats not what theyre selling its a reaction image you goat look at the file name look at the text on the image that says roll over image to zoom in on my suffering
  getting this angry about a reaction image  anon are you ok
i wonder if anyone else got news or updates with their purchase    did anyone use tenshishop for this release have you gotten any news from her
  weird penises  ffs anon i will never unsee this
  its not mobile only now though
  my dude im still waiting to hear about sweetie violet
  i have very similar measurements to you 91/70 and i actually really like full shirring i think its comfy and cute and since im not a whale it doesnt look stretched out and gross it looks like its supposed to but thats just me quarter shirring is nice too for a more smooth/less frumpy look you honestly should be able to fit into quarter shirred meta ive owned several pieces and never had an issue with it ive never owned a half shirred dress but i can imagine why they could potentially be unflattering
  not worth it just like everyone else said i tried it for like an hour and then deleted my account and moved on lol
i bought my first lolita dress today its so gorgeous i wanted it in pink and white but they didnt have it in stock so i got it in blue and white instead i bought it off lolita wardrobe i also have a question now i need to buy a petticoat for it and im wondering how they get it so very very poofy in the sample pictures what are the absolute poofiest bell shaped pettis i can get
  the wunderwelt original petti is pretty freakin huge its actually too huge for some of my dresses so i rarely use it lol
  do you mean huge as in too long for the dress its a bit difficult because i cant find the length of the actual skirt of the dress anywhere so i dont know what length petti to get how long is the wunderwelt original
  i fit quarter shirred meta but it looks terrible the front seams pull while the shirring doesnt lay right looks lumpy and feels uncomfortable and then their full shirring dresses dont come far enough around the shirring is barely visible from the front maybe my shoulders are broader than yours or something else about my build is ruining the look but i always feel very overstuffed when i have shirring stretched too far
    if someone could direct me to where the first chapters are i could knock out a handful in a few days i cant typeset for shit though so youll have to endure that
  its 45 cm long according to the website it should be fine by huge i meant poofy af the only dresses i have it wont fit lengthwise are shorter oldschool pieces so you should be good with the one you just ordered    i see isnt it wild how two people with almost the same measurements can have totally different fit issues im a bit on the broad shouldered side too so must be something else maybe your rib cage is wider i have a friend who has had struggles fitting certain brand pieces brand due to that even though shes smaller all over than i am
  nayrt but it looks like its in that greentext link
  i heard the earlier chapters get deleted as more come out hopefully the early ones resurface eventually but you might want to start with whats currently available anyway in case it gets deleted and thanks so much anon id put up with ms paint typesetting if it meant i could read it
  how does this reader work its very confusing
  how fat are you anon im a tall girl and bigger for lolita 93cm bust and 76cm waist and meta looks fine on me the shirring isnt stretched out or not laying right etc
  nayrt its length is about 45cm so pretty standard for a petticoat its huge in terms of volume how long is this dress you might be able to guesstimate the skirt portion by the overall length
  the size of the dress is 102 cm long it also seems to come down below the knees ive heard that the model wearing it is 163cm and im only slightly shorter than that so maybe its a 40cm bodice and a 60cm skirt or maybe around 50 50
been debating buying pic related   however i think its weird is how the jsk is us162 in the official shop but on lm its being sold for about us75 good condition i mean sure second hand is different but i still think the price difference is pretty big does rseries not have good quality or am i overthinking things here gulls
  definitely overthinking chinese brands generally sell for a lot less second hand unless its a really coveted piece kl jellyfish nameless poem back in the 1st release etc
  bottom left is gorgeous but i hate high waist cuts guess ill have to find a cute black bustier
  the length will be about 60cm for the skirt most dresses around the 90cm mark have 50cm length skirts and longer dresses tend to just have the length added in the skirt rather than the bodice otherwise you would have a very drop waisted dress that fitted oddly  a 45cm petticoat may be a bit short maybe look on taobao at aurora and ariel for a longer one  ideally you want your petticoat around 5cm shorter or youll get dropoff and too long will show
  how do they even manage to get such a bell shape with a skirt like this all the pettis im finding more a line in shape due to the length and would not achieve this effect
  maybe crinoline with petti on top
    that and possibly stacking pettis or just photoshop
  that amount of poof definitely looks like a good petticoat on top of a cage skirt/crinoline theres a great one on etsy iirc pic related not sure if the seller is still around tho
  nayrt but a couple of years ago i was at 78 cm flat chest 64 waist 43 cm shoulders and 164 cm tall so it is possible
vms message about closing     would a kind anon please translate it
  heres a google translate  thank you very much for your continued patronage of victorian maiden this year including the first sale at the beginning of the year at the time of closing the press room we have developed various projects such as 20th anniversary project commemorating the 20th anniversary of closing sale activities we have made a great deal of contributions to everyone i was able to have support and celebrated the end of this year i would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the staff it was a year supported by the warm support of everyone but this time victorian maiden had the end of december 2018 and it will be a briefing to end the current brand activity once thank you very much for your patronage over 20 years from the spring of 2019 we are planning to develop a new victorian maiden mainly for new products we have decided to make decisions thanks to the many people who have used this year all year we will strive to be sincere and sincerely than ever so we are happy to be with you as soon as we can wait for the next report victorian maiden staff inc
  oh my god this makes me so happy im going to regularly throw my money at them when they reopen i love you vm
  a new victorian maiden  watch them go the ap route and start pandering to the noveau riche chinese with tacky polyester ott lacemonsters
  im so happy they arent 100 closing down
  or theyre getting acquired/working more closely with wunderwelt like moite  thats the future i want to see im mostly grateful theyre only closing down temporarily
did someone ever experience something missing from their closet child order i let them ship it to my tenso address together with other stuff but when it arrived a choker i ordered from cc was missing
  i had this happen once and i actually i did not even notice since i had forgotten what i ordered but a couple weeks later they emailed me and said they realized their mistake and were sending me the item i bet if you contact them you will get a refund or they will ship it
i just bought my first sweet dress off of maiden clothing today  i am strictly a gothic lolita so this is very out of style for me but i really love vintage themed prints since i feel like they can be worn in a more mature way that suits my look better     for those who own diner doll in mint when looking for accessories should i look for more of a sax color or mint the color of this one seems kind of inbetween so maybe someone who has coorded it can tell me which work better also does anyone have any ap jewelry or otks that they can recommend for me to search for second hand that go particularly well with this one i will be coording this with a white blouse and the jsk came with the headbow so im set there just need legwear and jewelry ideas
 171 cm tall   85 bust   72 waist   36 shoulders   91 hip    am i too fucked for old school im trying to lose weight
  not at all im 176cm tall with a 90cm bust and 70cm waist and theres plenty of old school that fits me great my only problem is bodices being too short but most pieces fit me very well save for small fitted items so you should do just fine if not better
  just avoid unshirred skirts
  i have the same height as you try to aim for a 68cm waist its a realistic goal for that height that you should be able to keep it without starving yourself a lot of things will never fit you unless you turn into stick mode but for that you will have to drastically change your lifestyle forever
  i posted my measurements upthread 9192 bust about 7072 waist fluctuating throughout the day    im muscular more than fat is that the problem or are you just stretching out dresses and not realizing it looks bad
  nayrt but i think i depends on which dress youre wearing i have partially shirred meta thats super stretchy and some that has no give at all
      thanks gulls thats reassuring im aiming for a 70 cm waist so
why dont western lolitas have/use twitter at least the feed is chronological and all the brands are there  you arent limited to your own original content in order to stay active is is just that likes on twitter arent the same as instas thus not working for a quick ego boost
      i dont think they will switch to a different lolita style rather that becoming a lolitainspired casual brand
  its not chronological anymore      your problem wont be your fat itll be your height meta will be the most forgiving as far as that goes
  same tbh
  if thats anything like iw whites casual lolita im game
  in all honesty i hope they dont go the casual route  i love vm and have bought a lot from them over the years but i buy it because its elegant tailored and sometimes just so detailed and luxurious im not much into paying  for casual clothes im into paying the big bucks for the really luxurious detailed stuff and will gladly continue to do so so long as they keep making it     ive bought stuff from iw white and whereas i like it id rather buy from their regular line for the higher quality and detail too what i hope vm is talking about would be a new vm where they still make the same kind of stuff they do not but really branch to a new market like moitie did new vm with same elegance and quality but multiple sizes easier overseas ordering and more regular releases and branching into new color and design choices would be ideal
  i dont mind if they do thin girls will always look better anyways
  they already do though
praise mana for the shit storm we are about to receive amen
  i think they already do im definitely not skinny but im tall and muscular with a bit of chub and ap shirred back shit is way too big and i have a hella big ribcage
  which ones specifically in my experience their shirred pieces arent too big and they have corset lacing to make them smaller their unshirred pieces are
  all the ap i have is older lp stuff maybe thats why all i know is that it looks super big on me i have tons of older shirred some even fully meta and it fits well and isnt too big
  just a quick update for you ive got the translation 95 done just smoothing it out a bit honestly and im nearly 10 pages into typesetting might be able to get it up late tonight or sometime tomorrow
  its gone
  nayrt but thank you anon
  same im on the taller side and like it when brands make slightly larger sizes because they fit me better and i know i will look better than a short fatty in the same thing so idgaf
  deleted i wasnt able to grab more caps than the first few comments did someone grab her last two comments
  this is what i caught did anyone catch the rest
  bless you anon
        alright yall here it is took me 20min to translate all goddamn day to typeset truthfully im not totally pleased but since i havent seen prior chapters it cant be helped hopefully this satisfies you guys a bit leave comments point out mistakes whatever    thankfully other than the typesetting this was so much easier than the last translation i did for /cgl/
  thank you so much anon you did an awesome job
  omg this is amazing thankyou
  thankyouthankyouthankyou
    hey just wanted you gulls to know that theres a translation team working on it but i dont think there are scans of the first two chapters the physical drop for the manga is soon though until then were almost done with the 4 prototype chapters and will most likely make a new thread for dumping them when were all done
  this is beautiful thank you anon i cried a little not gonna lie
  this hit me straight in the feels
  can you do this one next 
  that touched my heart thank you anon
  damn it i want it chinese lolitas please make this sell out so i can get the inevitable mto down the line
  god i teared up real bad thank you
  its a community basically made for lolitaatheart underage roleplayers real lolitas post on facebook    also im incredibly wary of amino wanting a community for everything that exists on the planet i think its datamining and wouldnt be surpised if it gets busted for being shady down the line dont install it youre just not missing anything
  nayrt but amino doesnt make those its the users themselves hence role players/whiny itas making their ownand failing to maintain it when they disagree with any rules or get concrit
  its an ita goldmine i only go there to check out the secrets
            thanks anons im definitely not going to use it actively then although i do kind of want to try it anyways just to experience itas and 12 year old cringe in full force until i get sick of it ill stick to the facebook groups
  im not crying you are
  the perfect read for ild thank you anon
  anon this is so good i love
        fullon land boat is a gogo god save the queen
  other than the floral satellite dish attached to her head this is so cute
  someone save misako
  thats not misako you dumb bitch
                      glad everyone enjoyed ive never done anything like this before so it was a fun experience  as for doing the next chapter i could do it but i might not be able to do anything with it until kera posts it next week im having trouble pulling images from the reader itll also probably take a bit longer to get out because of the wordiness so dont expect one day turnaround     happy ild everyone
  but lolita is just clothes not a costume  this is only a few inches away from full on gone with the wind southern belle cosplay
  fuck the haters i want to get married in this
  to be fair i use it because facebook is a garbage company and i dont have one not all the lolitas are bad the adult lolita group was good until people slowly stopped posting and the mod abandoned it

  she would be a glorious centerpiece for the azalea trail maids
  holy shit another wilmington lolita
  are you from mobile anon
  i am not but i have plenty of family out there and just across in louisiana i always loved seeing the trail maids theyre what i dreamt of during all those cotillion and charm school classes growing up
    get the girl from napoleon dynamite to make some for you
new   new   new   new 
now that san japan is over what are you looking forward to coming up weve got onicon anime nomikai anime dallas ant etc but im mostly waiting for ikkicon
  nomikai dallas woops im an idiot
im done for the year all the cons listed are shit or look like first year shit shows ill be swinging back when akon rolls on up
  probably will go to alamo city
  does it have actual panels or just the celebrity autographs crap
considerint swinging by nomikai and anime dallas to see how bad theyll be ikkicon and ant are still awful
onicon for me i go for the san luiss swim up bar
  considering that they are spite cons run by voice actors expect them to be awful
relmscon cctx
  why are they spite cons do they not get asked to be guests anymore
  its capeshit and normies no panels just a giant vendors alley and autographs you have to pay for
san japan cosplay contest was a fucking joke
  i heard it was super competitive and the judges struggled with their choices but i didnt go what was it like
  i personally enjoyed it i mean there wasnt like a clear cut winner this year a lot of people in certain categories looked pretty matched up from a basic audience perspective i left as soon as keiran whatever started singing bc it was cringey as fuck
considering preregistering for okashicon currently depends on if i find a good job or not though i dont have a steady income at all atm ive heard good things about it and the booth girls at sj were super sweet and informative
  keiran whatever  who is this person i swear they keep popping up at every convention they go to and no one can tell me who the fuck they are do you just ask to be a guest at conventions and you get to be a guest
  its a youtube star which usually attracts younger teenagers for fans theyre probably really cheap to get as a guest which is why theyre everywhere
what are we going to do in the spring animematsuri was the biggest thing and now its in june if you were even still going what cons are there between march and may
  matsuri was shit anyway theres a bunch of small cons in spring to go to instead
  tell me what they are then anime cons dot com just has a big gapping hole
  author musician and honestly super fun to hang out with so im always glad when hes on the guest list desu
skipping ant and ikki after last year but giving anime dallas a try they need to get their pr together or they wont have any panels in time they only just started accepting them    never heard of nomikai dallas it seems like another mini akon might as well try it too
i dont understand how these threads are always simotaniously full of people bitching about texas cons only bringing low tier funi va as guests and also excited to try anime dallas/nomikai    did yall even read the about us section their board is just a bunch of funi va i do find it interesting the number seems to have dropped i swear when they first announced there were 45 board members now theres only 2 with more to come
  lol i dont go for the guests i want to cosplay and i just dont want to suffocate in crowded halls like ant or be kept up all night at shit hotels with no noise control like ikki i could care less about guest quality the good guests are impossible to get in line to the bad ones no one wants
  there are multiple people posting here with varying opinions shocking i know for example i only bother with akon as i only go to two cons a year it and ax i dont cosplay but i care about guests and i like seeing my friends who do cosplay theyre all going to be at the big convention so thats where i go someone like  is happy doing this too theyre willing to spend the time to try out a small convention because they dont care about guests thats cool too different priorities
  a big gapping hole  anon theres three listed on there for texas between march and may
  popular youtube singer from canada or britain who knows anime so thats enough to be a guest
  i find it funny how akon decided to get actually good guests once anime matsuri who always got top tier guests started burning to the ground
  what guests are you talking about matsuri usually got certain guests after akon did
akon because im poor and cant afford anything earlier
i wish akon would release more information about next year im excited and want to start planning i hope they do something big for the big 30
  not sure on anime dallas deal but nomikai has an ex akon staffer whos really bitter about it
okay guys what cons should i avoid and what should i go to    i want to try new things akon is on my shit list after last year ikkicon hasnt been good in ages    whats coming up that i shouldnt miss and why ive heard just as much bad as good about ant
  nothing it is all dead for now in the rgv all we have left are small conventions in edinburg and pharr    this year ramsey did not do his small con in the septoctober time do you think he is finally done
  i think youre shit out of luck anon people werent happy with animefest or san japan this year so basically all of your options are crap i mean i like animefest but some people wish it was a little more eventful and you mostly just go to san japan for the city that its in if you dont like akon animefest or san japan youre just screwed i dont know i guess theres comic conventions and pax
  good luck to the molesters shitshow trying to compete with everyones eh its the beginning of summer lets go get fucked up con
i think the reason i like ikkicon is because i dont stay in the hotel because im local i know its an unorganized as all hell but its about the size i like and i can have fun and leave when necessary meeting up and drinking with people from here to complain is strangely really fun for me
  i miss ikki being in the convention center the hotel is alright but i feel super claustrophobic somethimes
  i feel exactly the same ikki was so much better when it was at the hilton on sixth street because you didnt feel like you had to stay in the hotel you could very easily go to stuff nearby that is actually open the stuff around the renaissance is either closed or very limited stuff thats not worth bothering with plus holy shit their dealers hall/artist alley is way too tiny now
  what was wrong with animefest i went in 2017 and loved it no thoughts about ant
  you went in 2017 which was a great year were talking about 2018 which wasnot a great year parking situation was bad hotel was being remodeled and the convention did fuckall to let people know in advance no notable guests or even that many guests in general despite anime fest claiming that there would be omg so many guests announced guys just wait panels were really bad last year was also chaotic but at least the convention was fun and worth it this year was also chaotic but not fun itll probably be my last year afest had its run
    afest 2017 was a complete shitshow other than the musical guest which was fun
    anything in houston thats worth it
is realmscon worth going to if youre from san antonio
  its a very very small con but if you have friends going or youre planning on going to the beach its worth it i wouldnt say the con itself is worth it on its own though this coming from some one else who lives in san antonio and used to go to it every year
  it sounds like going for saturday is alright then do you know anything about onicon in galveston
  ive never been to oni sorry but ive heard its not great maybe others can tell you on that one
  meh everything beach con sometimes smells
  nayrt but anime matsuri never had toru furuya or toshio furukawa which akon did a few months ago then again i only really care about vintage anime and seiyuus and industry folks who did work during the 70s through the early 90s are the only guests i truly care about because of this ams guest list has always been shit quality for my preference in guests and guests are really my only reason i go to cons ever
  2017 was super hectic 2018 had no guests i still like animefest but its not a huge con and as far as huge cons go if you wanna stay in texas and you dont like akon you dont have much esp if you only like anime    ant isnt worth it at all 100 of people i talked to about it last year regretted buying a badge and ive never been to a con before where that happened so ghosting it and then fucking off to round one is the only way it can be enjoyed really
never been to akon been to onicon plenty of times and ikkicon is a blast in my opnion
  dont talk shit about hiei faggot
  oni in galveston is the closest the other 4 are done though calling jfest and mgd conventions is a little loose unless theres something else i dont know about    oh and if youre into video games especially retro ones arcade expo is next month total party con fun as hell
have there been any meet ups between texas con goers from here ive only seen pics from like 2015
  no disrespect to either jfest nor mgdi enjoyed bothbut jfest really is that a festival more than a con and mgd is on the cusp of becoming a real albeit tiny con give it another year of growth and being more than one day
  not in a long time because no one is willing to commit and schedule the things and the people that show up to them are almost always guys
  no its all steampunk drama and shit guests
  comicpalooza is a blast with amazing guests
  if you want theres a texas /cgl/ discord but we dont usually have formal meets i think
  nayrt but oni like any other con is what you make of it if you have friends to hang with itll be fun but objectively its a super small mediocre con in a fairly small convention center not much bigger than your smaller hotelhosted cons    that being said their artist alley is on con floor which doesnt require a pass so the gf  i ghosted it for an evening and saw all there was to see in an hour or two desu we didnt get carded for the arcade either but there wasnt much to it cant speak on dealers room quality though    tbh we mainly went for the weekend in galveston
thoughts on ikkicon    i lost interest ever since they changed their hotel that first year during the switch they had absolutely nothing going on has it gotten better
  only for one day if at all dont get a hotel its tiny and half of the shit is western not something youd invest heavily in also small
  its exactly the same as the first year it moved to the new hotel so if you didnt like it then you wont like it now  only difference is the hotel was finally offering cheap con specials at lunch and dinner finally
  do you have any winter or spring recommendations
im so fucking mad ant is in that same shitty fucking hotel as last year i was actually starting to really enjoy it at the hilton and it felt like it was doing really well and growing this irving spot is literally the worst location and i went to yulecons first two years still competing for the hell of it but ant has driven themselves into the ground
  unfortunately not really for whatever reason most of the winter and spring cons are very small and not really worth traveling long distances for
  its somehow completely awful and extremely entertaining
  how so
  its unorganized the last two years have taken hours to let guests pick up badges the panelists are seemingly chosen at random a decent portion of them arent really anime related a panel that you think is interesting will likely be run by someone whos not well versed in the topic and is finished with their slides in 30 minutes the hotel is not so great     on the other hand the people you meet there are for the most part awesome because youre likely going to have an hour between things you actually want to do hang in the lobby and youll see people dressed in shit you like and you can legitimately share common ground by stating man theres really nothing to do right now instant conversation starter this boredom period is when people become a bit more open and receptive and begin to talk about their props costumes and probably wanting food or alcohol by saturday its transformed into a full party con better panels hopefully better cosplayers appear and random people are offering you drinks or weed or just extremely complimentary of your outfit because their already under the influence of those things
  forgive the bad grammar im on mobile
  ant was never a good con anon
  anon are you me i swear that is my exact ikkicon experience every year  its weird the con itself is bad but for whatever reason cool people and some genuinely interesting cosplays show up i got to see some pretty neat stuff up close and actually talk to the makers about it since they werent in a hurry to get anywhere cause there was no where to go
  saturday night at ikki is always surreal i got invited to participate in a lesbian threesome last year
  and did you
fandemic was pretty good some nice costumes also anyone go
    rennaisance hotel ikkicons always been the con i end up having weird sex at first an orgy then the woods confirmed party con
i wish we could get some more idol groups to perform over here
  you must be one of the 5 people who shit everywhere about this get your ass over to ax because no one cares
  yeah but i dont want give my money to californians
  you must not live in houston
  supporting molestocon
  no one wants to pay for idol shit in texas ya dumb cunt your options are cali or japan
  i wasnt talking about am autist
  what are you talking about then
  i like the love notes because theyre cool girls but yeah im not into the idol stuff
  thinks am is the only thing going on in houston  now i know for sure youre not in houston
  not at all realmscon is small and has gotten even smaller this year they have gone back down to hotel size and are putting all the aa workers at tables outside because they dont have space i dont know about the game room this year but usually its just a bunch of computer screens in a dark smelly room of bo and the dudes who take them never leave them so you wont find anything to play unless youre lucky last year the dealers room had super low quality aa stuff in it to fill space because they had less than 10 vendors im talking those fleece square plush things and perler bead art     if you have nothing better to do then id only recommend 1 day im a short drive distance and even i dont bother with the whole weekend youll run out of stuff to do in like 2 or 3 hours max
which cosplays are freeor really cheap to go to in houston
  anon i would pay many dollars for idol shit in tx because it would be so much cheaper than having to travel to la    im talking actual idols though not this bullshit dance cover wanna be shit that is plauging us right now
it seems anime matsuri is still the best
  i also like bullshit promises i dont care who they fuck over and who cares about rapey people in charge
  hi stefan  john still hates you
anyone else going to nomikai dallas next month i know its small but its only 5 and 15 mi from my apt id call it a win if i can get a few hours of entertainment out of it
at fandemic
  i was going to but i got a ticket to the yuri on ice crunchyroll thing
  a few hours of entertainment out of it    youre optimistic anon
  japan fest in the spring is free the small cons retropalooza arcade expo magical girl day etc tend to be cheap traders village comic con in april is 4 per car am comicpalooza and even oni and deltah can be on the pricier side theres been a ton of grand opening events in houston this year that are free that have contests
    seething
anyone at realmscon this weekend hows the new setup
  its cramp on the 3rd floor    outdoor annex you better be okay with walking in dirt
  yeah i just went today 3rd floor was so packed but the artist alley was better than the years before didnt check out the game room though i tried to check out outside but it was so windy and the few shops out there were extremely overpriced so not worth it imo
any real info on anime dallas im going because hell 20 is 20   but i digress i want to know if its gonna be worth staying 3 days or am i just gonna get drunk in my hotel room with my friends
  no one knows jack shit like the shills who keep plugging a show with jack shit going on
did anyone else see that burst of drama with that con thats scheduled during the same dates as akon next year i thought it was pretty hilarious that they got so defensive about someone being genuinely concerned about their attendance because of the scheduling conflict i had a good chuckle when those screen caps came across my feed
  post em i wanna see
    gotcha i nabbed these off a friend of a friends post so i dont know who the original commenter was but the gist was a representative of the con messaged them after they commented these are all i have sorry 1/
  im also at the fair today so sorry for any delays in posts
  ah shit that was it 7/7 my bad
  the way theyre replying to valid criticism says so much about how the con will be run i hope they know that
  i kind of want to follow it just to see it fail
  this is going to be a spectacular disaster thanks for the screen caps anon
houston lolita comms there is potentially going to be two meetups on the same day at the same place
  sure looks like it huh
    its a spite con run by old akon staff its in the same location as mini akon
  it looks like a fucking joke like mini akon
did anyone see the boku no hero movie in theaters here think monday/tuesday might be the last day the show it
  i saw it in san antonio last week on they day it was subbed instead of dubbed and was reminded why i dont do these things    fucking autists ruin everything    there was literally only 2 really bad autist in the theater but they happened to sit right next to me    movie starts in japanese  autist starts gasping whoa its in japanese oh man we have to read subs  movie says plus ultra autist start screaming omg hes going to go ultra  any time all might or deku smashes they scream along  every time something funny happens omg whats happening omg lol  dramatic music starts playing  omg this is the song when stuff happens    like i know i shouldve seen this coming but holy fuck just stay home if you literally can not shut your mouth for a movie i wanted so bad to just reach over and strangle them
  im kind of relieved my fianceé and i ended up not going
  yeah i wish i had stayed home i felt even worse because i bought tickets for me and my bf and he was in visible pain from the autists talking right next to him the whole movie    i just wanted us to have a good time    at least my bf said he still enjoyed the movie and at least got a story to tell his friends out of it
  next time go to drafthouse to get them kicked out
  yikes anon where did you go i saw it dubbed at the palladium and everyone was completely normal not even any cosplayers
  seconding this thats exactly what happened when i went to see it there and the staff came over and shushed them
        drafthouse was sold out by the time i realized there was a movie even coming out lol    i went to santikos bijou which i honestly thought was going to be good because they dont allow children under 12 and kids 1317 need an adult but i bet the teenagers acted better than my 2 adults
    sad part is people will probably still attend teenagers more than likely but the con is run by a guy who burned so many bridges with staff  volunteers at his previous con that i dont expect much in the way of organization    for an event trying to pretend its family friendly maybe it would have been better to not name it after a social drinking event
  tfw 38 and attending   i want an excuse to cosplay hang with friends and buy some art alley stuff why does it have to be mind blowing when its just a 5 event
  we must be critical of everything   we bitch about everything
im getting the impression that people here hate anything that isnt akon
im getting the impression that people here hate anything that isnt akon
      nah theres usually a lot of akon hate but the con season is mostly over so the general population is quiet youll see the bitching start a few months before the con itself because people like to bitch they will still attend though because its akon
  im 35 and my cosplay group is pretty well disbanded now the only thing bringing me back to anime cons at this point is selling in artist alley and hosting panels as a spectator nothing really holds my interest anymore doesnt help that i teach teenagers for a living either
  going to movies to watch them  not going to have fun with the other audience members  who does this if you want to watch a movie in peace then download it
  that sucks im sorry youve lost interest i tend to make a few new friends at any event not all are like the most fun to hang out with but meet enough people and some match up well enough i usually cosplay with my best friend more than anything
  theres a difference between a whole audience gasping or laughing and 2 individuals screaming throughout an entire movie    you sound like maybe you need to stop going to movies if you dont understand that     no one likes a person who cant shut up
anime north texas 2018 november 1618 2018 sheraton dfw airport hotel irving tx  anime dallas 2018 november 30  december 2 2018 hyatt regency dfw international airport    can someone explain why there are 2 cons that are only 2 weeks and a few miles apart    i recently moved to irving so its nice to have cons that basically require 0 prep/travel but the scheduling is full retard
  because people are retarded there is a good amount of spite too among fractured groups
  honestly as someone who gave up on ant mostly due to how fucking crowded it is i am not playing that game as a cosplayer hell i couldnt even get to events on the 2nd floor last year im extremely grateful for another con in the same month
  if they would kick out the assholes loitering then it wouldnt be an issue with crowds the con is still shit anyway though
  i feel u bro 40yo weeb here stopped cosplaying abt 5 yrs ago trying to wear more jfash lately because i still luv muh fandoms and want to express myself but the yunguns know shit about shit while acting like they know everything and older weebs that arent total autists are getting harder to find and i teach also so my time is limited hard to be a grown fangirl
    amen to that
looks like animefest is cleaning house
  list of positions
  there is a good amount of spite too among fractured groups    can someone explain the whole spitecon phenomenon that people here keep talking about
  you must be new spitecons happen on a regular basis when someone pisses in another person cheerios because they wont allow blackjack and hookers its not a texas thing but there does tend to be quite a few attempted here
so anyone got any good volunteer horror stories for onicon or am i in the clear
is it just me or does it seem like theres a lot less cons on here for 2019 so far usually around this time the big names have already announced their next year or even the small ones have their shit up and given theres only 5 left for 2018 3 big names it seems odd    that being said im moving up north from houston and will be right next to austin and san antonio starting january 2019 what are some good cons up in that area to check out    i havent been to rtx since 2015 but i might go this year since i wont need a hotel
  to tag onto this same anon ive heard mixed things about pax south is it worth it to check out since again no hotel fees ive wanted to go to a pax but unfortunately the best ones are not in the south
  maybe theyre slow or holding back to announce the date      if you want to see celebs or see aaa studios youre going to be disappointed if you want to sit down to play games to new shit that youve never heard of then this is the right place they dont bring the hype shit to south
  pax south is overcrowded and boring they focus too much on indie games and what few mainstream games they have are line capped within 30 minutes of the expo hall opening
      yeah unfortunately these things are what ive heard about pax south before too     do you guys have any other recommendations
anyone in south texas have an assload of scrap metal they dont want
  maybe keep an eye on sxsw gaming i went a couple years ago when it was free admission and it was pretty fun i dont think its free anymore but maybe its decent for the price
  if youre only interested in big names studios pax south is not the pax to attend if you like indie or table top games south can be fun the programming is a little lackluster but i still go every year because im more interested in seeing what smaller studios are putting out there than waiting in line for two hours to play a new switch game for fifteen minutes all paxs are overcrowded but south is nowhere near as bad as prime or east imo    if social drinking is your thing the south pub crawl is very fun and full of really friendly people ive made lasting friendships on it every single year and thats not something you can say about a lot of pub crawls
fandemic houston
  smells like a selfpost
  could she be any more tacky
i was promised to be paid for working san japan but its been a month now and nobody has ever gotten back with me i know other people i worled with already recieved their pay so i am guessing they play favorites on paying people
    dave wont pay until you bother him enough he likely just hopes youll forget
  didnt you know the experience was your pay
anyone else at nomikai
  in this rain hell no
  the con is indoors
ill fight someone if my panel is overlooked for some bullshit
going to anime dallas to meet some online friends and take part in the big voice acting competition you guys know anything about it details are somewhat scarce
  no one knows shit
  i volunteered to run a panel but no one has gotten back to me yet fingers crossed but idk generally what the wait time is on even established cons for something like that i wish theyd update
  you probably wont hear until the week of at best might want to try and email them once a week until you hear something back
  just letting you know they are prioritizing voice actor ran panels than fan ran panels i wouldnt waste anymore of your time trying to reach out you will get rejected either way
  which cons should i go to if i mainly like vidya and cosplay
does anyone know what days oni is having its musical performers its probably saturday but i cant make it saturday
  so how was it anon the schedule they released was pretty sad
  well its not losing interest the typical con stuff just gets boring after you see it multiple times in college i went to like 5 cons a year its just repetitive and given that i take an active role teaching for a living i get a bigger thrill conducting a panel or running a convention dept or selling art than taking a more passive spectator role and i hate to sound like a codger but cons were way better back in the day less high schoolers and whatnot thank god for dragoncon making friends with people who distrod fansub tapes and shit and discussing rare series are parts of fandom that are lost to the ages now hell none of my weeb students knew what visual kei was and i wept internally      hell yeah my fellow teacher definitely hard to just want to go out and express your stuff at this age and not be taken for one of the weirdos im thankful people usually assume im midlate 20s still but having the attitude that we can act as mentors to the young ones makes it seem a bit less irritating thats why i love running panels introducing them to great series from before they were alive for example but hell go to dc or another con geared to the old folks and youll really feel better i never feel out of place at dc except that im usually far below the usual level of intoxication
any other gulls going to alamo city con
  yee on saturday at least its not as fucking hot as last year
  going on sunday couldnt get any other days off so oh well really weird how its in the alamodome now whats up with that
  if you saw mermaid man and barnacle boy today that was me
  oh shit pics please
    id say probably because thats just when it was convenient for them and they dont look at other events    im really looking forward to anime dallas and ant too
  in the halloween thread probably theyre at the end
so the accc cosplay contest mc doing blackface seems to not be going over too well    did anyone compete and see that
  apparently it wasnt supposed to be blackface the dude was some character that was supposed to look all grubby and filthy and he did a poor job of applying his makeup and it looked like blackface i wasnt there to see it myself since i was stuck at my booth but my friend who went saw it firsthand
  he was dressed as powerline apparently not someone who is grubby and dirty
  ohoh my well then that does sound kinda bad  friend that saw him up close just said that the makeup was applied very haphazardly and that it wasnt even so she thought he was supposed to look like a filthy hobo character or something yikes
the cosplay in question regarding 
  its so bad its impressive
    a comparison that was posted to facebook
  making a costume in less than an hour  well i believe that at least
  yeah i posted us in the halloween thread
  unpaid bills cant book the venue we dont know
  but powerline isnt even really black hes a character in the goofyverse its wrong on a number of levels smh
    things sound like they were a real mess this year
this is what sjwers consider blackface now  grasping for straws
  heres your you now go back to your mothers basement
does westboro show up to bigger conventions in texas i want to see if i should make a fake protest sign for ikki
  i havent seen them but there was an antiabortion protester at akon
anybody know if acceptance enails are out yet for onicon
will ant announce any guests that arent the same five local vas trying to see who theyre going to attempt to have as judges for the contest not that theres anyone they can get that you have to impress
  thats a tall order to ask from ant
  they listed cosplay guests on their website
  im not going but ive seen my friends post their model acceptances
  thanks anon its definitely new from when i was on there the other day
  bitch about it on 4chan  suddenly appears on the website    oh theyre on here for sure
  it was up before the anon was asking i checked like last week
anyone get ikkicon panel acceptance letters i dont know if theyre being sent out today but hopefully soon    in other news anyone going to oni or planning to go to ant or anime dallas idk what else is going on other than pax in february
  im honestly hoping if it doesnt come out within the next day or two i dont get accepted i dont like throwing things together last minute and would rather just not host a panel if ill have a few weeks to do it
  pax in february    uhh youre gonna be quite disappointed when you realize its in january like it has always been
less than a week until ant and they still havent posted the fucking schedule pretty sure this will be its last year and theyve stopped giving a fuck
  glad im not going to that anime dallas posted theirs today and its nothing special but at least they did
  i mean its much easier to make a schedule when you have significantly less programming than any normal 3 day con they have huge gaping holes no panels until 2pm friday at several points theres just 1 panel running
how was the tea party at onicon worth the price good food     couldnt go didnt have enough to drop on the ticket    everyone was so nice it was fun the prices at the dealers room seemed better than usual con prices at least compared to am    roast was fun glad the autist in orange was kicked out
  i dont go to pax and apparently the tickets arent selling out anyway lmfao
at onicon and walked in on my boyfriend getting straddled by a girl cosplaying as vi she looked at me and said one girl wrecking crew
  thats no excuse im starting to think ant has no programming besides the maid café its 4 days until the con
  according to ig they posted the schedule a few minutes ago
  yeah just saw it the only thing im interested in is the swap meet but i dont see any details for it
  its going to keep shrinking until they bring a lot of big name studios and guests like they do at their other conventions the hype is gone for south people seem to only care about east or west its called pax indie for a reason
  anon i wasnt talking about ant
  just ingore it anon anime dallas staff is just trying to shit on other cons
     sorry anon i thought you were ant staff trying to shit on ad while procrastinating      not staff for any con ant and ad are both shit shows sorry to disappoint you
anyone know the bloodborne cosplayer
so ad advertised a formal dance but i dont see it i also dont see anything about the cosplay contest rules or whos running it
  probably because they dont have anyone running it
    why do you look more uncomfortable than her
  man you look like the warrior from dragon strike
  wow man you have bigger tits than she does nice rack
anyone know that the rumor is surrounding myka/mikomiko cosplay shes been posting nonstop about how its ruining her life but ive seen literally nothing about it so thinking its made up for sympathy
  what rumor i know shes obnoxious standing next to her for about five minutes at the akon contest last year showed me how self centered she is
  im trying to see if anyone knows what the rumor is because ive seen literally nothing said about her i figure shes making it up for attention because people have quit talking about her thats what happens when you act like youre 14 even though youre in your mid twenties
does anybody know why kawaiibro got arrested at onicon last weekend im a thirsty little flower and the only way to keep me alive is to water me with this tea
  kawaiibro got arrested  its about fucking time
  fucking finally does anyone know what happened wouldnt be surprised if he was caught providing alcohol to minors or being a drunken idiot in public since thats what he always does
  public intox bottle full of vodka has been asked multiple times not to do that at cons wonder if hell get banned
    any idea how bad it was likeeveryone drinks at cons but was it just his stupidity of having a literal vodka bottle out on the con floor or did he do something else
  wow its impressive to get arrested at a con whos legacy is people getting so shitfaced they defacate on couches
am is already losing guests and its still 7 months away  its okay at least theres boba
im trying to get out more around the austin area any suggestions for great places to eat and visit in lolita do you have experiences in restaurants that have made you feel good being out in fashion
  who the fuck is boba
  most cons do prioritize voice actor panels over fan panels but thats more about getting back their investment than anything else having said that its not a waste of time reaching out some times you just have to bug people a ton to get an answer
does anyone have a link to anime dallas cosplay contest rules
  whoever they are theyre not going either
am is forever fucked on us guests
    thats kind of trashy they could have told them in private      im from another southern state and dont know too much about am drama what have they done leading up to now to have such a shitty rep
  checked out their twitter it was created today lol looks like boycott folks are now making fake buisnesses pages to pull out of am talk about getting desperate
  from what i understand they ended up being taken to court over some payment issues but ended up settling out of court for most of them     on top of that the ceo is african/european and not keen to american culture he made some overly sexual jokes and references to some girls back in 2015 he made a shitty apology apology that nobody took seriously and now there is a whole boycott movement trying to shut down the convention because of the above    personally i dont really care either way but its kind of fun to watch them at each others throats lol
  are you serious its clearly a joke
  the payment stuff would definitely spook me as a guest va or vendor thats a really shitty thing to have on your record as an event that relies on bringing in talent and big names    thanks anon i figured it was a scandal issue they probably will end up cancelled by next year when popular vas are pulling out 7 months in advance
  they will be forced to stick to japanese guests for now on    you cant yell rape or help if you dont know how in english its how john likes it
  no because they dont exist
good on average  san japan  afest  ok tier  ikkicon  ushicon  anime matsuri dgaf about loli complaints  visit friends primarily tier  akon  onicon  pure shit tier  that small one in oklahoma i cant even remember  also akon    r8/h8
  san japan used to be great now they cater to the normies and mainly get youtubers just to make a quick buck they also dont care what panels they book they stopped caring about the attendees a long time ago
  so where would deltah fall in your system anon just out of curiosity
  why are you including an oklahoma con in what im assuming is a ranking of texas cons
  one of the relatively few cons i have not been to actually  also forgot to put allcon in ok tier even with it occurring near some furcon at the same time last time i bothered to check      i didnt like having one con alone in the category
  forgot to replay to you they all seem to be doing that nowadays which makes me sad they got rid of classic jap vinyl guy by the escalators and have nothing particularly interesting for the last while    also all these cons need to stop with the lgbt bullshit panels fuck right off with that shit
  well i predict am may sink into the shitter this year if bam keeps scaring away all of the talent
    one can only hope
    the lgbtq panels can get reptative but dont go if you dont like them just like any other panel you dont have an interest in
  turns out they finally did get back to me after i poked them a few times im running the swap meet i dont really have enough experience to do something more than that i wanted to contribute something though hopefully people show up with stuff to trade once i inherited a swap meet on accident because nobody showed up and i just ended up giving my crap away because i didnt want to haul it all home
  its just annoying when these people try to shove sexuality shit into everything they are cons for anime/etc not some gender and sexuality fair
    you just sound a little afraid of the gays there buddy no one is shoving anything down your throat are you attending these panels im going with a no considering youre pretty against them so if you arent going them how are they shoving anything down your throat    im not a furry sometimes cons have panels for furries i dont care because i dont attend them it doesnt change my con plans at all     stop wasting energy on hating something like those panels go do your own thing at cons and have fun simple as that
  not thinking about how gay and trans characters are common in anime  embarrassing
does anyone at ant know if you need a badge to get into artist alley im ghosting with some friends and wanted to look at the art
  as a joke 90 of the time mind you    because those are panels wasted on lgbt pandering and not weeb shit
  only place they were checking badges today was dealers but thats from what my friends told me so im not positive
  cant hurt to try then thanks anon
  im sorry are you saying the same environment that bred yaoi paddles and softcore porn photos in public spaces is not shoving it in your face
  because those are panels wasted on lgbt pandering and not weeb shit  hate to break it to you but as someone who has been on the board for approving panels at one of the larger cons very few true weeb panels are submitted anymore but a shitton of generic cartoon ones like su or voltron ones for furries/steam punk/general cosplay making and several lgbt ones are submitted usually any weeb ones that are even mostly decent ideas are excepted and after that other nonweeb stuff is used to fill in the blanks   so tldr you want more weeb panels at your cons start fucking submitting them
    no one does yaoi paddles anymore cons cover up porn in public these days your argument is invalid
  invalid  ok
  oh no stupid faces so scandalous  go away
  they arent around because people were literally beating each other with them and cons had to ban them thirsty yaoi fans would see cosplayers oh their favorite gay bois and assault them    but yeah anime cons arent a degenerate cesspool and we should totally cater to the people that would attack others because of gay sex fantasy    and what do you mean cons can cover stuff up the whole argument is they have panels about it
    anon mentioned porn being in public places most cons require even aa artists cover up any adult items panels arent public and should require a badge not to mention id if the panel is 18      yaoi paddles are a thing of the past its extremely rare to see them anymore even at cons that havent banned them hell yaoi con did even have them when i attend a few years ago     yall just sound homophobic as hell     if you want more weeb panels then step up or shut up host them you want something then you put in effort to get it simple as that
  i had a student who came to school with this shit on a jacket
  damage controlling a joke
  im sorry how is the opinion that you feel like there is an oversaturation of an off topic subject matter heavily favored in programming homophobic you going to call me anti american because i dont want western cartoon panels too    your saying the reason cons have 10 gay panels over a weekend is because no one submits anything else ive worked events too thats not true it is happening because people like you who are in decision making positions want it to happen and favor the content
lmao can ikkicon hurry up and announce greg ayres and a youtuber with 7k subs already
  lgbt panels make no sense at an anime con and are often put on schedules because the person chosing panels is lbgt  its like having a panel about being a teenager  yes tons of them are there  its not related content  and when you find yourself going to only one panel over the weekend but the convention has 3 or 4 panels catering to a demo with no specific connection it can be aggravating  yaoi panels are content and context appropriate  a panel about shipping your favorite voltron boys is pushing it  a lgbt in the community panel is just to make a statement about the opinions of a con organizer and thats never a good idea  i wouldnt be okay with a panel about gun control at a con its just not relevant
      if staff is choosing to have that many lgbt panels then they arent doing a good job same can be said if they allow panels hosted by well known problematic people like say jebus or something    i can definitely see what youre saying and agree if theres that much focus on lgbt panels it is an issue i just dont see if huge problem if its like 1 2 is ok but really stretching it imo panel for the con weekend    as for panels there really does need to be more people submitting though otherwise you end up with shit offerings
  ive worked events too thats not true it is happening because people like you who are in decision making positions want it to happen and favor the content  anon im  and ive only respond to what i assume was you earlier once and yeah youre full of shit you really should see the list of panels people submit these days theres very little good anime content or weeb stuff as you put it most of the nonwestern non lgbt crap that gets submitted bad trivia panels ask so and so a question remember these fucking awful panels the obligatory what is hentai or hentai for beginners at least 3 times and lets not forget all the weeb panels on shipping someone with someone and why thats not the one true ship i shit you not
apparently someone who won at ant yesterday is a sandbagger saw a debate pop up on my feed and wanted clarification if anyone knows anything
  why doesnt my panel about a hourlong discussion in shipping deku with yuri gets denied otoh a well thought out proposal about the history of sexuality in animation in how it applies to japanese culture history gets approved assholes i want to talk about what i get off to in so i deserve my panel
    any proof or info on this
  ayrt it was pretty vague no names were mentioned besides that he won two pretty big awards at matsuri i didnt go so i dont know who it is but i was curious
   really should see the list of panels people submit these days    i do and ive seen quality relevant content not approved in favor of generic lgbt community bullshit
  this is based off my memory but i think the winners were    halloween hero academia group  some other hero academia guy  fire emblem  mccree  pokemon quad suit  saber  dance skit  mini muse  alucard    dunno if that helps narrow it down
how was ant this year for anyone that went    i was on the fence about going but i ultimately decided against it because im a lazy cheap bastard im wondering if i should be regretting it right now
    but is the host shitty if the panelist has been a problem before then yeah cons wont take their panels    or are you just salty your panels arent chosen anon
  i do  i dont believe you have no
  yep thats it this is all an elaborate ruse because im salty my hour of content got turned down at a chinese cartoon convention       you dont have to it is an anonymous image board
  went on saturday there were a shitload of danganronpa cosplayers and 90of them were obnoxious there was one point where several of them threw a bottle of brown liquid into the swimming pool and almost hit someone with it in the process all while screaming bloody murder at eachother i didnt realize danganronpa was like the homestuck fanbase     aside from that it was shitty overall tiny aa with mediocre art and crafts and the dealer room was also small one of the dealers had nothing but clothes for dogs with outdated fandom merch and stupid dogrelated puns the couple running the booth were morbidly obese mid to late 50s and brought their dog with them that clearly was an accessory and not a service animal the maid cafe girls were all fat and tone deaf and none of the panels seemed interesting to me     i took a break from this shitty con for a couple years to see if it would improve and it somehow got worse i dont understand why its still around    you dodged a bullet not going anon
    well what kinds of panels do you want exactly obviously anything lgbt upsets you so be specific anon what do you want for panels
  no i dont want unrelated content ive attended panels covering lgbt shit in relation to the media the con is supposed to be about they were very informative and interesting     i dont understand why wanting panels related to the topic the convention advertises its about is some radical homophobic stance to you but ok
    you still didnt explain what panels you want exactly
  they obviously dont have a preference anon they just wanted attention from bitching about nothing
  you still didnt explain what panels you want exactly    panels related to the topic the convention advertises    if you are too dumb to figure out what relevant content is then i cant help you
  sorry anon your shitty otp slash with gay ass shittard friends will not be happening no one wants to see or hear gay tumblr shit as the screams of 40 fat fucks squeal like the pigs cons arent going to allow shittards like you to recreate yaoi pairings bullshit or pretend to be a 2d character as they drivel out aspie shit it got banned for a reason     relevant doesnt always mean its quality if cons didnt screen them youd see substantially worst shit like the example above if you demand high quality panels then tell the right people because they arent mind readers ya dumb shit
  nayrt but saying relevant content isnt specific you sound like youre being generic because you dont have a clue what you actually want for panels which is why people here think youre just being a homophobic autist
  what the ever loving fuck are you talking about      i really dont understand why you cant comprehend that someone would want panels related to anime/j music/japanese culture /japanese media at an anime con instead on an hour long bitch fest about the troubles of no one respecting your 3 genders but i hope this spelled it out enough for you
  it was alright not great but i didnt have anything else going on the food trucks were good but it was 10 for the cheapest stuff check in had almost no line to get badges i go for the gaming and it was fun
  there is always a group of annoying fucks narutards hatiala cosplayers homestuckers undertale if a fuck ton of middle school kids dress up like it then it is going to be that annoying ass group
  that someone would want panels related to anime/j music/japanese culture /japanese media  ok look man you have a few options on why youre not getting your glorious nipponese content you wont shut up about  no one is submitting the content  this is the most likely start submitting stuff  a few people are submitting it but its being submitted by autists who the con ignores or the panel itself sounds boring/cringy/poorly thought out  also very likely  a few people are submitting the content but its just not a big enough draw for the schedulers to consider it  also likely some panel about japan from 14001500 might not be as popular as the lgbt panels that trigger you so much    and the last option  its the con pandering to them sjws  this is unlikely but lets say its true for a minute clearly if they have several at a con or even one it has an audience thats going to it and making it worth considering for the con they need panels people will go to not ones that they can point to and say look how japanese my con is    at the end of the day it really doesnt matter because you crying here like a tiny pussy will change nothing take up this matter with whatever con youre buttmad at and either complain directly to programming most have a direct email you can contact them at or start submitting the panels you want be the change you want to see and all that
  if people really wanted shitty lgbt panels at cons why does every con that saturates programming with them get complaints then im not talking about 1 or 2 panels im talking 10 of programming dedicated to an unrelated niche you honestly dont believe that kind of saturation just coincidentally happens and its not because programming staff have an agenda what if we started seeing 10 of panels about being a furry or 10 of panels about being a teenager a bunch of people at cons are also those things like i said way up in the thread ive seen relevant panel about popular topics go unapproved to make way for panels that cater to lgbt    you dont have to believe me or even agree with me that its a problem but you should stop tossing around the word homophobic when its not applicable it makes you sound like a militant gay
  seriously and these panel acceptance letters are taking forever dealers too
    as someone who has helped with people choosing panels for a con you are so wrong on how it works its really hilarious    the only agenda they have is to put asses in seats     hate to spoil your theory but im not lgbt or whatever its about understanding the attendees and what they happen to want     i never liked homestuck or the fans but you better believe a homestuck panel would be added to a schedule why because that fandom filled rooms     i dont get why youre do salty anon theres usually a lot of other panels to attend that arent lgbt youre seriously making shit up at this point    point out cons that have this agenda youre convinced of screen cap panel schedules to prove this theory you have
  the anon is making shit up if 10 of panels are about lgbt at a large anime con thatd mean there would be 10 to 20 panels spreading this agenda a regular anime convention talked about on 4chan has around 100 to 200 panels    i can not recall a single anime con in texas with that many lgbt panels not related to anime maybe 3 at most thats 153    the anon pushing this stupid agenda is a delusional pos
      im assuming anon is talking about havencon which was an lgbt fandom con in austin that folded after this years event even then it wasnt a huge convention and they didnt shove advertising down anyones throat at other conventions when they handed out flyers for it   again homophobe anon just wanted to bait everyone into giving him attention now we need a new thread
  you honestly dont believe that kind of saturation just coincidentally happens and its not because programming staff have an agenda  no i dont  what if we started seeing 10 of panels about being a furry or 10 of panels about being a teenager  we had this already when steampunk was popular there were tons of panels for them at anime cons i didnt care for steampunk so i ignored those panels and didnt cry about it on a vietnamese basket weaving site    what is popular with people will get panels plain and simple also im not the one calling you a homophobe but youre working on making everyone here believe it
  im sure you think whatever work youve done is the end all be all its not i wish everyone that worked a con made their decisions only to put asses in seats then we might actually have some good content sadly cons are run by volunteers for the most part and so its much harder to get competent people to do the work thats how you end up with bias that is overlooked because they are willing to do the work to get to shape the event the way they want to i guess its nice someone is so optimistic about the intentions of con staff it means you havent seen the sausage and become completely jaded yet
    so you cant provide screen caps then to prove what youre saying
  yeah let me spend hours compiling shit for a bitchy little anon to win an internet argument in a few years im sure if you keep working youll see the issue either that or youre biased too in which case this entire conversation is fruitless
  and when steampunk was oversaturating anime cons people bitched about that relentlessly people still bitch about cons that kept it around thanks for another solid example of people wanting relevant to content      haven con billed itself as lgbt if anything its the one con i think should be able to have as much of that shit as it wants and yet it couldnt last more than a few yearshm
    so youre talking out of your ass thought so
  youre mad at san japan arent you anon
  yep im making it all up and spending time pretending bias exists in cons just to piss you off its not like you yourself could go look up every cons schedule from the last few years and visibly see the influx of lgbt content with your own eyes nope im making it all up its not like the biggest anime convention in the country inexplicably had a drag queen as a billed guest its not like some cons are actively promoting everyone where pronoun badges nope theres no oversaturation of a very small demographic at all
    sorry your cons arent for straight dudes anymore now that was some toxic culture back in the day
  so you are homophobic
  how dare you assume anyones gender and sexuality how fucking dare you      yes because not wanting gay panels at an anime convention  hating all gay people and wanting them to die its exactly the same
    yeah sucks when you make some generalizations dont it
  if you are trying to make some kind of point you really suck at it
  how many of you guys are going to anime dallas    im currently debating whether or not to buy a ticket
  look i know you guys are new here and only posting to advertise your shit show but this thread is in auto sage go start a new one or post in the already existing ad thread
  youre a giant faggot    ive only been to about 3 cons in my entire life
  only faggots like you are talking about ad no one i know is going to the show as its voice actor con
  i think ramsey is focusing on stcc theres always omnicon but i think the audience has shifted
  omnicon is deeeeeeeeeeead
    calling me a faggot  posting in a thread thats autosaging asking if anyone is going to a con that is doa    yes i am the faggot here
so why the fuck is a known sexual predator whos been banned from a majority of the lolita comms in texas allowed to go to oni like jesus christ i just saw the lor video
what are you looking forward to    my death
  wow i didnt know john went to oni       elaborate who are you talking about
  afest 2018 was nuts we had lsd and some girls started fucking on the bed  so much shit went down that weekend
  how do you even find parties like that at conventions other than knowing people that host them ahead of time i can never figure out how to find these crazy convention parties i keep hearing about
  you learn to talk to interesting people then gain their trust no one is going to invite aspies and fuckbois it helps if you can contribute drugs if youre a freeloading dickshit youre not going to hear about it
lolita cringe thread post the most cringeworthy images youve got
fucking dom  why do you have to embarrass both lolitas and vegans
  you killed a thread for ita thread 20
  obligatory tifferet with her butchered ctp
and this bitch  her instagram is an eyesore loads of ddlg/petplay degeneracy and her wearing actual lolita while doing so
  thats funny more than outright cringe the fuck were they protesting anyway
  her coord is on point tho    ayyy no puta
this models facial expressions were often painful
  why are you guys so ass blasted about ctp that any time this image is posted no one ever notices that thing on the left
  fat badly dressed lolitas are everywhere butchered ctp is not   does anyone have any other pics of that dress btw
  oh my god i forgot about tiferet i hope shes doing well
  isnt that minor who suicide after being sexually abused
  didnt she kill herself
  is it idk i just had it saved to my cringe folder i hope thats not her shit i dont want to be posting minors or disrespecting the dead here
  yeah thats her sad thing she was a misled teen        no  she could have looked so cute in proper lolita and if she didnt fucking called it that
      deleted it and deleted it from my folder sorry anons i genuinely didnt realise
  this is why teaparties need to be regulated
twin ita weebs auditioning for the x factor in spain   
anyone else remember novalas athleisure line
  god im fucking obsessed with these types of knockoff nightmare comparisons i think its because i went through the same type of shit with that cosplay/lolita site starts with an m i think
  sweet lolita utterly fails to teach mryan to tango   
  wait the original is somehow worse
  leave derpchan alone
  i actually love this
  tokyorebel still has those in their online store i was thinking about ordering a tshirt just because its extremely ridiculous
  call that a yango
  this is hilarious lmao the blood stain placement is simply tragic
  if he danced 3 in a row while wearing tanga panties it could be a yanga yango yanda
  cringe and plain ol ita are different cringe isnt only badly dressed it usually is doing or saying something inappropriate/stupid/pretentious/unselfaware so like  is not ita but shes sitting in garbage and the other pics if i remember had her being sexy in the garbage thats really cringe even if shes not ita
  so did i until i saw the other pics in the series it was like a weird sexy photoshoot anon sadly i forgot to save the rest
  i never noticed but she is wearing the jsks/skirts on top of each other
  nope not even once this was part of a gravure shoot the girl isnt a lolita shes an adult actress and domme these pics were definitely a fetish thing       i got chu senpai
  thats actually pretty good for her there are much cringier photos you could have picked
  good point anon
  why is this cringe her coord is adorable as hell or is it because of her size because thats scary skinny
          this isnt cringe its comedy gold
  wake me up    cant wake up
  it makes me cringe because its one of the biggest mismatches between coord and person ive ever seen its like mindbendingly weird and uncomfortable to look at even though the coord is cute and she usually dresses well it would probably suit her kid but looks so inappropriate on her and then the cutesy stickers its like she doesnt know what she looks like and that makes me cringe
  this is the only one thats made me genuinely cringe so far
  margo in venuss clothes is worse
    shut up kayce anal tear
  i had no idea i wish i never knew that detail
i can also dump the miss xv telenovela pics but i think they were posted on this board recently this was the show where the girls claimed to have invented cupcake fashion which was really just butchered lolita dresses
  how did venus look older here then she does now
  one of those days am i right ladies    they both look horrible
  i think her mom styled her and did her makeup
  milanoo
  stress is a hell of a drug
    s q u i c k e r w o n k e r s  also that hat is on closet child right now
  this is some fancy grade cringe i need more
  whats a ctp
    ahahah i saw one of these while i was walking around the city in sydney the screens have generic horror footage of animal slaughtershit youd see on facebook and are protesting the consumption of meat pretty fucking funny
  cats tea party im guessing
  that makes almost no sense i get the tea party part but where does the cat part come from
  there are cats on the dress named cats tea party
  shes that rich french mom with her equally lolita 13yo daughter and shes trying so hard to stay into sweet but she looks too old for it and she has a tranny face
  i got shivers from cringing so hard oh my god
  its ok anon she was trolling anyway in those pictures that was her whole persona  lets just hope shes in a better place now
  she doesnt have a tranny face shes jsut older anon if you think that is a tranny face cant wait until youre that age and have a bitchy tranny face too
  im retarded
i really miss ita horror stories threads but they dont really seem to be a thing anymore so if anyone has any stories of cringey things itas in your comm do please share
  well if its true that margo was starving her and abusing her then abuse ages people also she was probably stressed af
gothic lolita cuffs from etsy
  suprisingly not dom even though its a similar dress
  shed 100 just wear venus skin if she could
    imagine associating with these kind of losers jeez
from my citys harajuku fashion walk last year her coord would almost be almost okay if her fursona wasnt fuck ugly
  jfc
  yikes im a vegetarian lolita myself but this makes me cringe holy shit imagine being that attention seeking to wear lolita to something like a protest    inb4 its just clothes
  what really gets me about this one is that its supposed to be an anonymous protest yet she still insists not only on refusing to wear inconspicuous all black clothes but on wearing a limited run dress that maybe a couple other people in her state might own it makes her so easily identifiable it almost isnt funny why bother wearing a mask at all
  not from that same protest but id bet all the brand in my closet that its her    if it isntgod help us there are two of them
  bad news friend
  what the fuck is the point of having the mask if youre gonna post on facebook to say hey thats me
  i always found this funny not cringey
    i adore her though i do want to give her a steak or ten shes too skinny
  that sears family photo center backdrop  oof
  i know someone who partakes in these i just dont get why they dress up in the same clothes as conspiritards why dress like even dumber people wear an animal mask or something i thought they were 9/11 truthers or were protesting chemtrails the first time i saw them
  nothing about this is okay anon
  if you dont brag about your social justice on the internet did you even protest
  this is hilarious edge chan with a cane oy gevalt      serial killer kei
  venus was going for kawaii but margot forced her cheap prostitute aesthetic in there because she wanted to sell vs virginity to the highest bidder so glad that old ugly leech is not a craigs list whore in seoul
  oh yeah brand ita ap whore who doesnt gothic but tried to protest moitie and their real leather by bags anyways and demand cruelty free bags even though moitie also had a synthetic leather option
  now  and an alcoholic with edema hohoho
  her coord would almost be almost okay  are you sure were looking at the same image anon her dress is cute thats literally the only thing thats okay about this
  can someone explain or send me a link with info about angelic venus i know who she is and what she does but i dont really understand what happened with her mom or whats happening now
  this actually disgusts me im all for animal rights im all for standing up for what you believe in but god damn    shes going to stand up there like she cares about those animals lives and acts like she actually wants change and then immediately turns around like  hurrrrr look at me in lolita  look at me doing so much good  peeps on facebook look how kind i am    youre not doing it for the animals at that point youre doing it for your own selfish reasons and im positive those animals would not appreciate you using their pain towards your own social gain    sage for mad vegan
  nah im also vegetarian and i do not do this when i go to a protest    pink frilly cupcake  i hope that cupcake has no food coloring    long story short her mom was super abusive think the stereotypical mothers who live their dreams through their daughters because they never fulfilled them   when venus gote tired and left she made up really gross stories about her
tagged as lolita fashion for some fucking reason    i hope people like this choke on their baby formula
  not just lolita but all the fucking tags disgusting does anyone else find it somehow worse when the babygirl is pretty too fatties are weird so i just expect degeneracy but when a pretty girl is into this you know she must be really damn crazy
press back  see lolita cringe
  that file name
  i hope people like this choke on their baby formula  same anonsame the sweet lolita and gothic lolita tags are invaded by those filthy bitches and now the lolita fashion tag too i despise them       ive seen cute girls into it but its mostly ugly girls and fatties double ew their doms are always crusty men too
what in the actual fuck    covered kids face because apparently he has enough issues already
  id fuck her though
  that leg fupa
  stooooppppp can we talk about margo is the craziest person on earth for a second
  lmfao
  jesus fuck she looks demonic
  go to lolcow and talk there
for those who were there during the really bad days of early amino remember ellinore and milanoo chan those two and midnight shine who made nice lolitas amino after being told off by la mods well heres some recent photos
  milanoo chan
  i dont really see whats cringe about modelsans sister but i get that she looks exhausted and thats kind of funnyi guess
  this is why haenuli is trash only blobs and ita manbabies lick that thieving asshole up
  gotdayum thots desecrating honey cake
  lolitas with threatening auras
  i like their more elegant and gothic stuff much more than the sweet garbage she puts out i hope those headbows stop going straight up like they do it feels weird looking at them
  if you google it youll find the kiwifarms thread which is comprehensive enlightening and hilarious if you like laughing at forty something abusive narcissistic leeches getting their comeuppance
  short and sweet version    everyone thinks venus is cringe and pedobait  turns out its momma marge the whole time wanting to sell her virginity off  marge tries to orchestrate her marriage to a fanboy from japan for visas  venus actually likes him agrees to marriage  marge gets jealous that daughter likes this boy takes her back to korea  marge tries to set her up with a korean man  venus runs away to japan to marry fanboy  marge flips her shit goes full psycho  even stalks them to japan and shows up at their doorstep to take venus back  tries to kidnap venus in the airport after claiming venus left stuff that marge was trying to return  marge is homeless lives in airport taking nudes  eventually fucks back off to korea  becomes a night woman sleeping with men including one man to pay for her flights  tries to take everything venus owns online  venus has to get a lawyer  marge still being a crazy woman in korean hostel claiming venus husband is a tranny skinwalker trying to be venus and venus is an evil witch trying to kill mommy dearest    its just pure insanity
  and while margo is screeching on instagram about her evil daughter venus is living happily with her husband and new friends and not giving margs the time of the day as far as we know
    so i just spent a good half hour looking through that thread and holy shit what a deep personal tragedy id heard margo was crazy but thought people were just exaggerating and assuming things but there are really no assumptions necessary with this woman im glad venus got out and is doing well she deserves all the best after having to deal with that shit
  and venus has replaced her with fanboys loving mom and her cool auntie zhu so she still has maternal female figures in her life
  im kinda amused how i see 3 3f bonnets in a row all very similar colours somehow it reminds me of when you are breeding dogs one dog is the best then everyone breeds with that one until they all become almost the same but because there are no other options it become either incest or less good liniage 3f is the topdog in bonnets and everyone wears it because we all want the perfect bonnet and you either end up knowing you have the same headdress as multiple others at the event or you have a less good bonnet    no complaint just amused im buying my very own very soon
  just fyi for contexts sake i think 3f was a guest at the con that year so its not a coincidence that their bonnets were everywhere
  i free bleed its great no one notices
  and how is wearing your fetish wear in public presentable just because your dom wants you to it doesnt become good to do
lolita is cringe itself no need for a thread
  he looks like this actor from star trek
  really bad days of early amino  is really bad worth mentioning its still really bad nowadays after all or did i miss something making it even worse
  i like some of their designs but with what i hear about the fabric and sewing quality no way i pay those prices they ask i can understand only people that dont fit anything else are that dumb  little sad they stopped making dropped waists too i loved them
  is she in dutch com i dont remember seeing her but if she is i know i need to avoid
  it was mainly a joke they are popular in general but i know they are not worn always by everyone like this and if they are the best is subject to taste but i just thought the image was funny
  what happened to that one ita who roleplayed as her grandpa was that milanoochan or someone else
  id let edgechan look at me like that
  do these people actually drink baby formula ive never tasted it but ive smelled that shit and it smells fucking nasty just drink cows milk for your weird fetish shit like damn also i was literally just thinking about how if these people really want to be treated like babies they have way too many choking hazards on their clothes/jewelry
  amino now is just full of average lolita posting and the occasional creep that gets banned within a hour but a year or two ago there was nothing but kids starting drama full caps comment fights itas posting their terrible first coords and then posting about the mods because they took down their post archives on 4chan cant even do it justice it was a experience to live through if you want examples of it i might have screencaps
  that was milanoo chan and   is the latest pic of her on the far left she and ellinore   started a lolita brand and milanoo chan wore a apron that ellinore made to cakes and couture from what other anons said about her during the event milanoo chan brought her grandpa dressed in ouji and was apparently begging him to buy her stuff like a spoiled brat
  oh god these people are in my comm goddamnit florida lolitas
  dear god help you 
  i tried it out in the beginning and i quickly quit it where all safespace obsessed snowflake itas who just posted either their horrible ita coords or complained about all the meanies and how everyone should be nice and that apps notified me multiple times a day to come back which was super annoying and since im at pc a lot i was annoyed at the lack of web functionality anyways back on point didnt know it improved only thing i saw after quiting was the regular animo dumb in the ita tread and some caps of idiotic posts every now and then gotta admit they do seem less common than in the begin time now i think about it is it worth another try or still a sjw always be nice shit and is that app still nagging it was as annoying as the people but if its better i might retry
  i wouldnt be surprised sometimes with some jaw surgeries when you cant eat solid food they write it as an option together with tips how to make it taste better so you can always blame something like that if a stranger finds out and asks youre not gonna see if someone had surgery 4 weeks ago but no solid food can be up to 6 weeks    beside were talking fetishism who love to be talked down like their little kids perhaps they like having to eat nasty things so their daddy can punish them for acting like they hate it and not finishing their dinner they also like peeing in diapers and having daddy clean it after all
  its improved they have their own toned down version of behind the bows on there its pretty entertaining i think because they started allowing tame salt secrets it made the itas upset because lolitas must be luvlies so now its less itas and more tolerable people theres still some dumb kids but now you have to be level 5 to post so it gives newbies time to read posts and rules as for the amino notifications you can turn them off from the settings
  youre on the site that started that dumb shit
  still love it either way shes doing the style right and love the contrast of filth and elegence
  less good bonnet  3f bonnets arent even that great people act like theyre the best bonnets when they arent ive owned indie and handmade bonnets that looked better and were much cheaper
  i cant believe 4chan wrote v for vendetta it all makes sense now
  no morons from b are unoriginal retards and took it from the movie  but in this case im talking about those same morons starting a trend on b to wear those masks in public and then tell other people they go on b
  hold up that movie didnt come up with guy fawkes masks
    it literally did and i think you mean the comic book that inspired the movie anyways youre being stupid on two levels
  ive never seen the movie because i dont really care but guy fawkes is a real guy
  but the masks werent a thing until v for vendetta do you people even fuckin google shit before talking jesus christ youre almost as dumb as she is just a mask and an ipad away
  yeah the comic did you braindead mongoloid      chanology was at least 8 degrees of separation from 4chan by its prime that piece of shit was lock and stock ebaumsworld and gaia online by that point dont put that evil on us
  shes probably still afraid to be vulnerable around people dealing with the trauma of being raised by an insane monster etc ptsd and depression are pretty much guaranteed plus anorexic tendencies because her body was never good enough for mommy fearest but its great that her in laws and zsu are the salt of the earth
  nayrt but yes please screencaps
  ok then well heres a dump with backstory from what i remember     this girl was pestering mods in public and private chats to be hired as a mod herself well to prove herself as a mod she decided to post about all the knowledge she knows about the fashion shes been wearing for 2 years apparently after being politely corrected by people in the comments she throws a hissy fit and gets herself banned then she goes straight to alt fashion amino trying to be a mod there got called out for her previous tantrum and i havent heard from her since this is just one collage of the screenshots i have
  please tell me this is satire or a troll
  im not dumb because i didnt watch a gay ass movie    the trend of wearing the masks at protests was started on b    sorry that upset you read up on the site you visit all the time
  heres the story of kylie now this one takes a bit to explain but kylie posted a pic of herself in a bodyline dress with a ratty cotton candy colored wig that was bought at party city no petti no makeup no shoesno socks no taste that post was disabled by a mod because she couldnt handle the nice concrit people were giving apparently she spends all the money money she apparently steals from kids she beats up at school on nothing but candy because she has a sugar addiction she went through all the public chats starting with im about to throw myself out the fucking window why are people so rude and proceeded to tell the mods to go fuck themselves she was banned cried to the shittier lolita amino where people who are banned from la go lolita 101 and she got posted in the ita thread and blamed her being posted on the mods she then proceeded to threaten mods and other members of the community and threatened to hack their phones she denounced all alt fashion on discord and her twitter yet still tries to be apart of the communities she says she hates she kept getting posted in the ita thread and she wrote thing long speech thats now a copy pasta she claims she has did or multiple personalities and pretends like shes some derranged killer now shes uncomfortably obsessed with that poppy and mars argo after she got blocked blocked by titanic sinclair and her twitter suspended
  tell us some that you liked good bonnet recs are always welcome
  i cant believe im getting fucking trolled on this rn fuck
  oh my god i almost forgot about her do you happen to have the caps of her claiming she has a salt allergy and her skin boils or something like a slug if exposed to table salt
  damn uh i dont have a screenshot of that idk if that was her or not anon but i can imagine her saying something crazy like that
  can you even follow a thread chain not every anon is me dude    i merely stated that the trend started here    you brought up the movie
  just the she do you not see that father he looks normal from the thumbnail butjesus on a cross thats not how you lipstick
  oh yeah dude totally they started on b because of the movie
  how tf do degenerates like these get relationships nani
  oh fuck this was good this was around the time i stopped logging in to the lolita amino sad too i liked a lot of people who posted there but there was too much drama and i was still building my wardrobe i still wonder how everyones doing
cant wait to see an ita parade in ctp
  2018  flyleaf username with xs
  is this girl from texas i have a hunch i know her but i want to confirm
  anything you want because you can do what you want  crazy right  yeah crazy those poor longsuffering mods     learn empathy  coming from an angry attention whore with zero self awareness who probably has a cluster b personality disorder thats a hoot
  i was doing a good job of not laughing until  blocked by titanic sinclair  fantastic
  cats tea party has devalued because of itas could now just as well be clowns toilet paper
  weare all upset about such a little stock at ap museum no need to be that salty 3
  all hail the trash queen
  got the wrong door honey the leather party is next door  fuck you
  she had life threatening surgry because of her body issues and she tired to confide in margo only fir margo to go around and use that as anti venus fuel its why she was in the hospital earlier this year   hopefully shes getting better but she fucked her stomach up way too bad and margo can give less of a fuck because all she wants is venuss money again
lolita amino anon here and i have another story for yall toni roni so she started out posting furry lolita art on amino mods told her knock it off take that to furry amino also on furry amino she decides to post furry p o r n on a app meant for kids afterwards she goes to post pastel gore her profile had a graphic drawing of a woman slitting her wrists gore is prohibited on amino so she got a strike and toni wouldnt shut the fuck up about it especially when at the time there was a push for the mods to remove art altogether due to tonis drawings and the amount of kids posting looking this kawaii loli dress i drew for my oc so when mods announced that art can only be posted within a art chat toni threw a hissy fit toni i forgot to mention is a self absorbed transtrender she claimed she is biologically a man and that she is a brolita but as shes posted things like her hairy ass legs because real men dont shave uvu as well as a half naked picture of herself its clear she is a female after she got banned from lolita amino for throwing another hissy fit she goes off and creates another community called alternative fashion fun which is now dead last i saw now on facebook because no one cares for her amino she creates a amino page for lolita littles gets called out for it and throws a tantrum then on various forums such as wrmp and rufflechat she claims different things toni at the time was 1617 yet she was boasting about how shes a emt trains dogs works at some charities etc pretty much lying out of her own ass to get validation of herself to make her feel better or to just seem more high and mighty than others got called out again for lying about who she is and thats the last i saw of fakeboy toni toni is dev h on facebook for those of you who may have thought hey that sounds familiar shes moved to baltimore and her facebook is now dead hopefully from shame
      some more screenshots from kylie pic was her first attempt at lolita which started this whole thing
  good lord its dah dont forget shes also a master of martial arts in med school and in art school she disappeared around the same time as bmt
  i couldnt stand venus before but shes been much more bearable since she managed to escape her mom i remember margo complaining that venuss husband didnt make a lot of money and that venus would be unhappy but they look so comfy together idk why margo cant be happy for her margos family appears functional and supports venus idk what went wrong with margo
  did you mis the fact i already said it was a joke based on the fact they are popular and that i already acknowledged that even in appearance its highly discussable they are the best      i like the obscure half bonnet in black i got from surface spell i asked it to be made with chiffon closing straps and its really nice the model from amastacia wears it in multiple pictures too if you need worn pics i also have that infanta velveteen bonnet i think the shape is slightly nicer as it goes slightly further down my face and is a bit more round the lace isnt too detailed and not the highest quality but its nice looking and soft both are smaller more casual bonnets compared to 3f tho    i actually agree in the point i sonetimes worry how well 3f quality is i always questioned 3f lace looks cheapish rachel and the shiny ribbons maybe also a bit the fabric on the outside but damn the design is so gorgeous to me i just really want one because of it none beat those ones design wise but thats just taste
  when i was in japan i saw this indie brand called chatty hatty that made cute stuff  
  i want to throw up
i cringed pretty hard at the price listing i guess shes was trying to come off as funny but this is just like bragging
  wearing expensive dresses with unstyled hair and barely any makeup does not a lolita coord make
  what was the point of censoring if youre just gonna leave the names readable
  thats cute and funny      sad
  sorry i have a shitty phone and minimal fucks      is the same person who posted the essay above anon
  idk why margo cant be happy for her   that stuff is hard to explain if you havent experienced it i sympathize with weeby venus purely because my mother is also toxic and insane margot has a malicious cluster b personality disorder which means she is physically incapable of feeling normal empathy that region of the brain is demonstrably smaller and less active or any significant empathy at all for any living being including her own child tbh venus can count her lucky stars that she even survived childhood parents like that think nothing of putting their children in dangerous situations on a daily basis just for fun or just for attention and margo is a really bad case some horrible moms just have a lot of narcissistic tendencies but can keep up a mask to appear normal to most people live in what looks like normal families from the outside but margot lost the plot years ago and seems barely human
  good riddance to both of them dah also ripped off my coord pics and used them for her shitty art inspo that she posted in her ddlg group it was vile
  also this japanese indie brand makes nice stuff but they dont sell their stuff online i guess youd have to have an instore ss buy stuff for you  
    why would she spend all this on the clothes and 0 on makeup a haircut some contacts maybe get it together girl
  its a noveau riche chinese thing they want to show off that theyre rich so they buy really expensive dresses but they usually have more money than taste
  what the fuck this is the first ive heard of that link/caps
  actually its two blocks down
  why do these people have to plague our community
  here ya go top left is a direct cap from the ddlg group she made before she made it private as an extra bit of info she also allowed minors into the group some of the people in the group were 1213 years old bottom right is the original photo of my coord and bottom left is the traced art piece she made im all for people using coords for inspiration heck even artistic tracing is whatever but this nutcase was blocked by me on all social media accounts she somehow found my coord photos and insta and then she posted my ig handle in her ddlg group as a way of crediting me which led to a bunch of kinksters finding my account top right is where i messaged her to ask that she either remove the art or my account handle
  love that blue usa anyone have a lolibrary link to it
  i dont think theres a lolibrary page for it but its the online exclusive ice blue kumakumya
  heh is that fugly blog still around
  shes been working at baby sf for ages and still manages to look like shit
  how do you even get a job there does it pay well or are they nobenefits 6 an hour kind of gig lmao
  just like any other retail job
  its sf so at least 15 an hour
does this count as lolita cringe imagine scalping this high
  who eva buys that disney set is the dumbest muthafucka eva
  bmt ugh i still laugh at how she showed her ass in pettyfrills
  bmt is still around shes just annoying on her friends posts instead of in public
if she needs money for her sick daughter why cant she just sell her brand
  that dress is cringe by itself
  elexiel_grae  she
  wait lemme get this straight shes trying to sell a gift card to a normie store on a lolita sales page  wtf
  i wish marge would just get hit by a bus already narcissistic people should just voluntarily off themselves the world would be a much better place without em
  leave her alone
  oh wow tb thats so gross im so sorry that happened to you did she remove the credit at least
  i was in the same com with her for a short bit and she is the most annoying little shit you can ever find
  yep thankfully the mods removed it after 10 minutes
  standing up for unseelieallure   the bitch who posted comm members on a doll fetish forum without their consent   fuck off
  deets i visited her old comm once and she seemed nice maybe i just caught her on a good day i cringe pretty hard when she was acting like some efamouse instagramer spamming her shop and sakura con photos all over fb and amino a few months ago i was shocked because i didnt think she was like that at all when i had visited
  oh yeah i eventually convinced her to remove it she kept trying to brush me off though
  deets i didnt know she was even really part of the lolita community just thought she occasionally wore dresses for her trashy shoots
  god i dont even know where to start with this girl shes a trashy self obsessed spiteful idiotic cunt brief list of things shes done pretendee she was a super broke student and conned free rides free hotel free con pass out of her friends she later admitted to having several hundred dollars in spending cash for the weekend claims to have be vegan but fish dont count because they cant feel pain wore the most disgusting rotted falling apart tea parties in a fashion show wont throw them away because theyre ap made a post on lolita amino about how hard it is to be a vegan lolita and bawwwwd when it got deleted believes you can feed cats vegan diets notorious brand ita cant coord her way out of a paper sack attends a for profit art school refuses to do anything other than her weeb animu crap tried to get into the mmm tea party in full ap and a moitie key chain thats all ive got off the top of my head the vetting discord has like ten plus people who are either on her current comm or her former one so the milk has been well documented
  look her up on getoffegl on lj
  if you gotta hit gym to fit burando u can at least wear cute gear
  believes you can feed cats vegan diets  few things make me rage as hard as people feeding obligate carnivores vegan diets i hope someone forces her to live on a diet of grass and cardboard and omg vitamin supplements that totally make up for the lack of nutrition
  shes a trashy whore period
  fandom  300 dresses  spoiled rich brats  ah yes my favorite memes
        wow look at her trying to look she joined and left quickly because of money and meanies she was pretty active in the community when i first joined i remember she commented and posted in the egl comm on lj quite frequently she was not ostracised for being poor or ita it happened because she was a pervert and an idiot between the fetish forum incident and her posts about shit like wearing lolita to the gym everyone pretty much hated her also she has money and even had some brand back in the day this whole im too poor waah thing is bullshit       some people have the social skills to behave in a public setting but are still rotten to the core anon
  she has a few dresses from the sissy section on amazon
  its not a fandom oh my god kill me
  this sounds like a scam lol shes gonna send you some random numbers and by the time you check to see if they work either by going on the website to use their gift card balance checker or to actually buy stuff shell have blocked you and made off with your 200
  omg i totally forgot about the wearing bloomers to the gym thing lmao    to be fair i wear bloomers as shorts with some of my more normie things but theyre just clothes and i wouldnt call it lolita or anything even if i did wear them to go jogging or something which i wouldnt do anyway but for the sake of the discussion
i swear i saw those kylie screenshots 23 yrs ago isnt it time to find some better content and i think she was like 14 then i honestly dont expect any better of 14 year olds on the internet cut her a break shes prolly like 17 now and hardcore regretting that shit
  she was 16 back then if you want newer content then contribute to the thread anon
  people were asking for old amino caps dumdum post new shit or stop whining
  im amazed how much these people grasp for attention its like being trans is their only identifier their only personality trait the only thing they talk about lolita is a fashion just wear it and stop bitching bc at the end of the day who gives a fuck
  this a hundred times plus they bring shame to actual trans people that just wanna live their life as normally as possible and not scream they are at every possible occasion  fucking special snowflakes
    wasnt lor asked a question on one of her recent videos by this person its so weird and i kind of think its an age thing i know of a lot of trans people who never talk about it and theyre all over 30 someone once told me that the process can put you through a second puberty and that you regain the judgement of a 13year old for a few years before things settle
  just because someone is loud about their gender doesnt make them not real its like how some gay men are insanely loud and annoying it doesnt make them less gay to be an annoying asshole about it
  yes it does especially those who scream they are one gender but look and act entirely like their original gender its attention whoring and fakery at its finest if you look at this persons profile you will see that they present as feminine also the people who need to say that they are a trans man or trans woman instead of just saying they are the gender they prefer are clearly faking and doing it for attention actual trans people just want to live their lives as the gender they want not go around screaming how trans they are    also its clearly not a problem for brolitas to be accidentally misgendered in feminine clothing because they know it comes with the territory and i never heard of a brolita making a huge deal about it there is no reason that this person should either if being mistaken for a female bugs them this much then maybe they should just look act and present as male in the first place
  lolita fandom    wot in tarnation
  they shout it and talk about it all the time because they have to convince themselves more then those who they are interacting with its attention grabbing for sure but also saying a lie over and over because they themselves dont believe it thats why they will always start conversation with  as a transmale/female its themselves justifying their own opinion they are not to sure of themselves about every genuine trans person i have interacted with never throw up arms about misgendering or start a conversation as their trans gender in the opening sentence they just act the gender they are and hope you will accept them for it not make a scene like a 13 year old girl going though her goth phase and being told to take off the black lipstick by her dad
  this is great i love the juxtaposition
  what an unfortunate looking group of bystanders
  she made the whole meeting about her she act really bratty   get annoyed when no one talk about her diy shoes even though it looks shitty  talks about her vegan diet and talk about how its cruel to eat meat even thought we were in a sushi restaurant  jumps into people conversation even thought shes talking to someone else already  selling her old stuffs because she was moving her clothes were all moist and her shits were from daiso  the most annoying thing is she didnt notice how one of the girl were upset and crying during the meet another girl was walking over to check up on her and she has to jump in the conversation to seems nice she basically shove the other one out of the conversation and declare to the whole group on why sad girl was crying she just really rub people the wrong way
  did you not see the other pics in the series shes a gravure actress not a lolita
  she still looks a hell of a lot better than some of the girls here coord wise i wonder who picked it for her
      bless you anons
  what makes you think this poster is unseelie
i wish i had saved the pics of kate in a full ott coord in that legitimate apartment ad they were so uncanny
  her shits were from daiso  thats not a very nice thing to say about daiso but she sounds like a cunt      its not its kylie raina whos whining on kiwifarms about how were all a bunch of meanies because she cant afford ap and probably looked like shit in an amazon cosplay get up kiwis themselves warn against making a username thats the same as elsewhere shes a full on retard
  saw these in kopenhagen fucken faggots
  any links to her other sm i want to be a nosy cunt
  saw a couple of lolitas inside of a round1 in california didnt look that nice
  she bawleeted her old social media    glad to see she hasnt changed
  same three screenshots   its like 13 screenshots ive seen more in older threads  ive left lolita a long time ago  less than a year isnt a long time   im not asking for sympathy   if you left lolita and truly put it past you then you wouldnt be posting about meanies on a different site even when youre surrounded by people in the thread who dont even wear the fashion and yet can still find you just as annoying and pathetic attention whoring as you were in those screenshots then thats whats truly sad and childish
  any place the other screen shots are archived  kind of want to see is she warrants her own thread on the kiwifarms
  wearing expensive dresses   like cheap ass princess sofia cosplay
  how have people still not learned showing up to a kiwifarms thread making fun of you and telling them to get fukt isuniversally disastrous      amber would be disgusted
  about the hairy legs thingwhat i remember was her making a poll about if it should be allowed because she was a trans male and it made her feel less disforic so she went from claiming to be trans from claiming to be a bio male
  shes over it tho anon shes been over us for years so much so she has to whine about it and selfdoxx on kf of all places in 2018 the mark of a true lolcow      she wont get her own thread shes an idiot not much else to her unless shes scamming camming or trooning out
  like stand users degenerates attract other degenerates
    on these threads one was disabled by mods because kylie mad her bf joined to defend themselves lmao              
  where is she even from she looks like someone from cfls
  i think she was from the seattle comm
  jealous that they get to wear lolita and you dont
    this is the same chick who thought she could easily score a job at ap because she had retail experience from working at wendys classy
i know its tumblr but wtf does that have to do with old school lolita stupid kinksters
  some people should be gassed

  ty brapchan ill put this brap to good use 3
  youre the hero we need brapchan
  please make the biggest loudest braps you can 3
  i want to protect that smile
vomit
  arent they both married/in relationships this isnt the first time theyve posted something like this either
  they post pics like this frequently maybe pandering to people who like femine lesbians but claire is basically k8s girlfriend bc she takes care of her so much in la
  im so happy for venus now that she is out of her pyscho mothers clutches she seems so happy and healthy now
  this is why people think lolita is ageplay
  normally i think the k8 hate train is cringe but this has such a weird ageplay vibe thats really uncomfortable
  claire and kate whoring themselves out on patreon    disappointed but not surprised
  haha i have been noticing a trend of sweetleslita photos of that pair    the blurred hand in foreground pulling curtain to reveal c and k snuggling  the set up for this one in particular is kind of icky like i dont want to be in the intruder pov pls    the other posts i see on ig are cute though
  lets be frank and honest no matter what kte is an immature child who only got married to have a sense of stability and probably because it was expected of her shell end up like that girl who married doug hutchinson divorced regretting it and an overall mess i feel bad for her but the girl is a child a fucking child nothing more i wouldnt be surprised if a she never had a child or b had one but was one of those shitty moms that appeared on maury
  also this bitch makes a post about lolita not being a fetish yet posts this shit what a dumb cunt
    no they dont it depends on the person some people like diapers and some dont also there are a lot of kinks/dynamics mixed into this theres ddlg which is a dynamic like master and slave theres age play where you roleplay as an age different than your own thee daddy kink which only involves calling your so daddy and theres regression into little space which is when someone regresses into a mental space in wich they act and think as an age younger than their own its important to remember that all of the above can be sexual or nonsexual
  wow no one needs or wants to know that
  well i think a lot of people do actually
  nayrt but people should know something before they criticise it otherwise theyre just ignorant fucks
  thank you
isnt all lolita cringe though bunch of social gimps making fun of retards
  this entire video
  did you mean ugly bastard lolita
you know what to do
  good lord that is some uncannny valley shit
      all 3 of these bitches lookin like aliens
  jfc

everyone post holmat lineups
  ill post mine in a day or so cant decide if i want my meme cosplay to be known yet
  that shit was really unfortunate i honestly thought the picture w/ the gargoyle ribbon was fun    hopefully they catch who did that and justice is served    iwai was incredibly awesome other than a few hiccups with the hotel the party floor was dope despite the drama with that dumbass whole talked shit at one of the cops
whos ready for holmat

  pretty good looks like out of the illustrations
  neat but its better to make your cosplays yourself instead of buying them
  its shit
previous thread 
  keeping my promise from last thread to make the new one unfortunately very little to post last dump was very out of order leaving me to think there was more to dump gonna be a short one gulls
  and thats it for now unfortunately out of want for more coords ill try and upload any that might be posted today smallest pickings for a new thread in ages just wanted to escape the last thread to be honest
  we appreciate you anon
  this is really cute and i like it but i feel like its missing something maybe wristcuffs i would love to see the brown from the shoes more throughout the coord an underskirt would be cute too especially since her petti is showing most embarrassing behavior
  oh i like this
  this is literally so gorgeous it has a very modern and fashionable feel while still being lolita
  while i dony appreciate the dress itself this coord is really cute      i loved the colour combo she looks really nice on it      i dont see a problem with the coord concept but the dress fit makes it a bit off for me i dont know if the petti is not enough or if the dress is too large on the waist area making her look like a tent
  would it kill her to smile she always looks on the verge of killing herself i like this coord a lot though even a sticker over her face would do much service to the overall look shes a cute girl just depressing
  its her look  like that one pouty ap model whose name i cant think of atm
  if you want decent lolita discussions youre on the wrong site
  idk if you have noticed but nobody smiles in photos anymore everyone just pouts this is specially true of anyone who is popular and not just lolitas nearly every one    also the pic was clearly taken by herself smiling awkardly by yourself may feel foolish if someone else is taking my picture i nearly always smile but pics i take of myself like selfies etc i dont its uncomfortable also i notice the picture gets alot more attention if i dont smile even though my smile is nice
  this girl said its her first coord iirc and that she only found that she fucked up on the petticoat after taking pics not to excuse it but at least it shows promise       im angry about how much i fucking love this
  this is a cheap mess is everyone kidding me wtf happened to cgl
  i think its just samefag or the girl just complimenting herself    its definately not that intresting i would say its an average tier coord     not ita but not great either
  i like it a lot but for the fit and im not one of the people who have already complimented it
  the cheap pearls really kill this if the accessories where better i might like it but man
  honestly cheap jewelry is the ap aesthetic so
    i wish the cold shoulder trend would die out it adds absolutely nothing either show your shoulders with an off shoulder sleeve or admit you want a strap you cant have it both ways its stupid
    its bad when you can see theyre plastic from the picture can literally hear their stupid lightweight jingle gah
  even aps jewelry looks better than that it also has cute motifs while these are plain necklaces
    i mean she is on the verge of killing herself with all alcohol and no food
  isnt it russian culture to not smile and secondly she looks good anyways soon the side note though maybe she doesnt like her smile i know my face looks really round when i smile so i try not to
  its nice but im getting this is this really lolita or vintage vibe from it that i cant shake off
  i would have been happy if hp collabs came out maybe 10 years ago but with the current state of the franchise seeing hp related items just makes me kinda disgusted  other than that the coord is adorable      there just seem to be at least onetoomany normiestyled things shes new shell get there      is no one else bothered by that deflated underskirt the cold shoulder is interesting but the shape ruins it for me
  no one could ever just like something right it just has to be the person defending themselves
  i wish the colors were more balanced and that the silhouette was different it doesnt seem like lolita to me
  with the current state of the franchise seeing hp related items just makes me kinda disgusted  huh
  nayrt but the recent stuff has just been chock full of gross colonialist and racist shit and rowling has steadfastly cried white woman tears and refused to apologize or amend anything every time shes been called out for years
  me too
  are you lost
  i would like this so much more with a larmestyle chiffon jsk i think the oldschool sweet jsk doesnt really work with this look
  oh look its someone who pretends no one on cgl cares about racism cute
  ntayrt but ive always known her to be a hack she wont admit it but harry potter was first in the movie troll its a rather unheard of movie especially since it was overshadowed by the dumb sequel if youre shocked that this dumb bitch is writing awful books well that says a lot about you doesnt it    youre lost because you need to take your ass to /tv/ where you belong loser
    you could have mentioned the ridiculous retconning terrible consistency characterizations that got murdered in later works and a plot that resembles a braindead 15 year olds fanfic but no you had to go the racist route     i think she just doesnt know how to write diversity well being a sheltered white woman in europe and puts characters she think are diverse in really awkward positions this goes hand in hand with her awkward attempts at gay her awkward attempts at what the fuck was the cursed child and now this clusterfuck she needs to stop harry potter
  its not that i think people on /cgl/ dont care about racism its that i think your understanding of what constitutes racism is absurd and your frivolous complaints dont belong here
  ive been saying this for years
  doesnt matter you have watered down taste
      oddly enough these were the reasons i disliked the harry potter franchise originally  i read all the books borrowed from friends who were way more enthusiastic the first two were good but by the time the last books rolled around the reading was low key tedious    i like the new fantastic beasts franchise though the animals are cute and apparently i retained just enough information from everyone else feeding me potterhead stories that i could catch up on the storyline fairly fast    la foret wizarding world was annoying though so many gryffindor things and not much other houses
harry potter fans are so fucking annoying
  last books rolled around the reading was low key tedious    ill admit that while i was a fan of the series the last book was tedious and didnt finished it until the movie came out the conclusion was inevitable      while i find harry potter meets to be awesome they lost their luster
  honestly i hate franchises in general as their fans are usually morons harry potter is no exception
    ty i hate hp and the fact that for some reason its the one fandom that seems admissible in lolita why the house colors are shit everyone looks stupid with a fucking scarf and twig in their hand so ready for this to be over
  risa      join the club if youre trying to diss her well i think a lot of us are probably on her same sinking ship lmao
  wine beret is irking me but this is a great style for her open cardi under jacket with that random belt is odd but i like this casual look
  house colors are shit  green and grey will always be my favorite combo fite me
  i wish i never chucked my bodyline rhss
    im not sure what i expected considering last thread but go you i guess jaundice and early aging is kawaii after all
  so ready for this to be over  yeah but that rowling bitch wont give it a rest so you still have goobers like 
  i havent read any of the books in years but i thought it was green and silver
  house colors are shit  anon are you for real  red and gold  blue and silver  green and grey  look perfectly finethe only one that might be weird is hufflepuff with yellow and black not even that into hp but come on
  ntayrt but green and grey is not a weird color combo at all and neither is green and silver
  i dont even like hp and you sound bitter and boring
  agree anyone over the age of 14 who stills likes harry potter probably has some mental issues grow the fuck up anons
  you missed the point
got a good little chunk of coords today great after yesterday having none i even checked a lot to make sure tried to keep my promise at least
  this is cute but i think itd be cuter with a natural colored wig
  end dump
  these shoops get more horrifying every day briz im begging you please accept your face the way it is
  i bet youre one of those people that turns their brain off to watch movies
  with photos like this is it any wonder people think lolita is a costume
  would be cute with different hair this wig looks bad and ratty
  im glad shes not wearing those cringey hipster hello kitty glasses for once cute for the most part but i dont get the oddly shaped bunny ears
  isa brand cape really the most costumey thing youve seen
  anon shes holding a fucking wand and posing in front of owl post whether its brand or not is kind of irrelevant at this point
  i think they are bent forward and the filtering and background edit took away our other normal context clues
      i like the wig actually it fits the overall whimsical style of the photo and matches in color/shade
  that headdress is incredible but its wasted on this otherwise very average sweet coord and she described this as classic didnt she briz why
  goodness i have the exact opposite opinion
  yeah in russian culture a smile is for expressing joy not for convincing people that you are pleasant if shes busy taking a bunch of photos alone there is no reason to smile at the wall so it would look foolish its not like shes sharing a funny joke with friends or winning an award in the photo
  not a fan of the wig or the angle used for this pic its not at all flattering and its hard to see the shape of her coord next time she should ask the person to take her pic from further away and closer to her bust or neck height rather than above coord looks cute though      this is a great wedding coord this sounds weird but i bet she looked really pretty saying her vows she was probably very excited when she took these pics so i hope her photographer got some more relaxed or candid ones too       shes a cute girl and the basic elements are there but i feel like this could be more polished some wristcuffs would help a lot a bit more petti would help the bow also looks a bit helicopterlike i think she needs to wear it a bit more forward on her head little details like makeup or nails could push it up a notch too im guessing she is quite new to the fashion and this isnt bad at all for someone new i hope she keeps trying and improves
  hate seeing cute coords ruined with zero effort faces how hard is it to do a little makeup and take off ugly glasses for pictures
  glasses in lolita are incredibly cute and not crazy enough to be too weird in the fashion what even is this is very pure/innocent looking not everything needs to be ott dolled up and fake although thats a good look too no hate on ott fake shit not being sarcastic
  look how happy she is you go bridechan i wish you a strong and happy marriage
  glasses can be these glasses are ugly as shit sorry you got posted
  not me but ok and all glasses practically look the same from a distance sorry youre anal about your glasses
  i really love appliqué dresses too bad ap wont be releasing those again
    agree it makes me laugh thinking that someone doesnt get how glasses arent for aesthetic purposes only its like saying omg why are you in that ugly black weelchair it doesnt match your coord get a pink one    in before someone says glasses / weelchair    i know it was just an example and some people with glasses do have a disability related to sight btw     i do agree some glasses are cuter than others but honestly people use them because they cant see shit so they shouldnt have to be considered part of the coord if you can match them great if they arent as cute as your coord people shouldnt care
    as always none of this excuses not taking them off for a picture
  why should i take off something that i wear every day every time im awake and that i need to see the camera taking the picture your reasoning is seriously fucked up anon leave people with bad eyesight be
  the point is they dont ruin a picture your negative ass attitude does
    fuck off my glasses are basically a part of me at this point i will not take them off for a picture and you know what ill still be fucking cute
  i wear glasses and i completely agree with this most people i know take them off for photos even in normal clothes
  im sorry you feel that something as necessary and insignificant to a photo like your glasses ruins a picture honestly you shouldnt have been made to feel that way
  i wasnt made to feel this way im quite capable of observing for myself the effect they have on otherwise pleasing coords and have independently reached my conclusion im sorry youre too lazy to put in the tiniest bit of effort to improve your shot
  glasses dont ruin a coord or a pic as long as you choose a cute pair in a neutral colour so either you bought a shitty pair or your glasses are very weird
  i guess everyone else bought shitty weird pairs too then because i wasnt just talking about my own coords
  normies dont take their glasses off for pics this is just some dumb thing ppl on cgl think happens go outside and realize most ppl actually need these and dont care     and if you really think a photo is better when someone who is blind cant see you dont actually wear glasses every glasses wearer knows that you start squinting to adjust
  do you remove your glasses when judgeing others coords too lol    or maybe you need a pair doesnt seem like you have good eyes
  as someone who wears glasses its not difficult to stop squinting for a moment do you have no control over your face
  as someone who wears glasses i think my face and facial expressions look better and more genuine when i can see
mini dump to move along but weekdays are pretty dry content wise
  is this even lolita
  sucks to be you all the people with glasses i know dont have this problem me in included
  this is everything i hate about modern lolita she could look so cute in the right coord but all of this looks like garbage minus her makeup
  im pretty happy i can take pictures looking like i always do without thinking im crap im sorry if for you its not like this       this has natural kei vibes aww
    how the hell do i think im crap i take photos with and without my glasses depending on how i feel and on the light i think i look equally good both ways youre the one clearly feeling crap about any photo without your glasses thats quite limiting if you ask me
  not if you a have bad enough eyes at that point you dont bother squinting because it doesnt make it any better
  i dont understand why its important to see clearly while having your photo taken in the first place my eyesight is awful but unless im trying to watch a screen drive or read something at a distance i keep my glasses in their case
  she looks like she might be one of those people on tumblr who identifies as a witch and worships the ancient greek pantheon despite not even being modern greek
  thatsoddly specific
  you cant control natural twitches and forcing your eyes open makes you look crazy       you dont have that bad eyesight if you only need it for driving and comps so ya you dont get it
  my eyesight is awful  unless im trying to watch a screen drive or read something at a distance i keep my glasses in their case    i wish my eyesight was awful too anon
  i wasnt saying that i had to just that my eyes are horrible 75 with astigmatism so squinting is pointless i just wear contacts because i like having peripheral vision
    shit anon are you me 75 with astigmatism twinsies
  nah son
  being called the person you agree with is so boring is that seriously all you can come up with and honey you may think youre thinking for yourself but i guarantee you your perception is based on what other people around you think and apparently you hang around assholes no surprise there
  thats fair but i dont get why she has them on it the first place are there any other bunny things in that coord its like an ita wearing cat ears because nyaaaaa uwu
  must be your pic the wig looks like she used it as a mop before wearing its a tangled mess
  se looks like shes taking a massive dump in her diaper or something and this is lolita
  theres a few hairs out of place but its hardly a tangled mess a wig is not a helmet   so im this person and glasses chan good to know i can switch up my look so drasticly i guess glasses really do make a difference
  a wig is not a helmet  it looks like a helmet on her it doesnt sit right the color of the wig is fine but the bangs and hairline dont look good at all    so im this person and glasses chan  you do realize that this is an anonymous board right
  no you just didnt have a good point anon saying that green and grey is their favorite color combo doesnt mean theyre a potterhead it means theyre not an autist that hates viable color combos simply because of association with a series
  wow you can quote but you cant use rational thought if you could think youd answer your own misunderstandings about the quoted text  obviously i know its an anonymous board by identifying myself im pointing out how over used the thats you in the photo trope is did you get that    and yes is it a wig not real hair it looks like a wig because it is a wig that dress looks more roccoco inspired they wore wigs then i like that shes wearing a wig that isnt mimicking real hair and helmets dont have hairs out of place
  nyart im the original bitter anon who doesnt like the house colors its specifically the tone of the colors that i dont care for id do an olive green and a grey but not that gross hunter green pic related
  wow you can quote but you cant use rational thought   are you ok what does quoting have anything to do with that    im pointing out how over used the thats you in the photo trope is  are you seriously referring to  sorry you got posted is a fucking meme    it looks like a wig because it is a wig  i never said anything about that i said it looks like a helmet dont put words in my mouth youre projecting    that dress looks more roccoco inspired they wore wigs then  yes they wore white wigs with piled up curls they were also nice and neat and not unnaturally colored with shitty bangs they didnt look anything like this one so i dont know why youre bringing that up    only reason why youd defend these girls so much is if you do the same things as them
  im fine are you you seem awefully stop liking what i dont likeish      then why reply with its an anonymous message board like you were defending yourself    actually you said it was a ratted mess i said thats natural to have hairs out of place as hair is not a helmet i brought up the helmet thing then you said it looks like a helmet which is contradictory to having hairs out of place as that would imply it being stiff with no movement    i dont look like them i like my style i just appreciate others styles
  i dont like the socks too sheer for how heavy and opaque the top of the coord is makes her look big
  the shoes are ugly and dont match though glasses are the least of her problems
  nayrt but that wig looks like shes wearing a pastel rats nest helmet its just choppy and bad looking not cute
  they arent the best match but they still match if youre trying to distinquish what makes someone/a photo beautiful its almost always confidence/posing/frameing/background confidence being the biggest deal in terms of posing and irl shitting on other people or yourself will unfortunately always keep you average at best because you cant fix a twisted face      its hardly a rats nest you can see where it weaves into eachother and its hardly a helmet or choppy there are no cuts and its flowing youre really committed to hating this
  if youre trying to distinquish what makes someone/a photo beautiful its almost always confidence/posing/frameing/background  no its mostly the subject
  its the subject and everything around it including the people looking at it you have to have a vision and show people that vision without being drowned in there expectations people want to see something inspiring and beautiful if you dont believed it yourself you wont be able to convince anyone else lighting angles colors background are all tricks to help show people that vision
  nayrt but its a gross wig anon it looks rough and disheveled
   was my first post in the thread did you know that multiple people can reply to you ugly glasses and shitty wigs arent different styles theyre ugly in every style
  how retarded are you
    i didnt claim it was the same person and it wouldnt matter if it was my points still stand if all you can reply with is hurt duurr gross and ugly then im done here
  i mean replying with hurr durr youre irrational and stupid is just as bad as hurrt durr youre ugly    inb4 i never said you were stupid and irrational    nobody ever said you were ugly either but you seem to enjoy projecting
  i said that like forever ago there have been many points since then but i fail to see any youve made that i didnt reply to i guess you are stupid and irrational and i never said or implied anyone called me ugly so
  look im sorry i called you irrational or said you couldnt think im actually sorry about that you were just being mean and i wanted to throw some of that back at you
  this is so bizarre to look at the aesthetic of her room and everything is very nice and then you see her ugly expression shitty underskirt and no legwear the fit of the rest is messy as well
  keeps meme posting  theres no brain left to turn off is there its just completely lights out in your skull
  complaining about someone posting pictures  on an image board
  shit thats meant for this pleasant anon  
  i believe one of them is an ap necklace actually     the one that bothers me the most is the large pearl one thats the longest
  olive green  in lolita  emerald green looks infinitely better
  its not her room she said it was an airbnb
    i kind of like the concept always wanted to do this too     just not a huge fan of this result kinda looks like she layered two cheaply made dresses together then threw in neutral gold shoes and called it done
really not sure what to make of this i feel like bangs would have helped her a lot but those shoes cant be saved
  the jacket is the thing ruining it the most totally not acceptable for lolita totally plain yet bile yellow hideous
  she looks like a grandma and not in the cute quirky grandmakei way i do think she has potential to be adorable in lolita with actually good styling makeup and hair but this is not it i cant even go down to specifics because so much of this is unflattering
dump time
  deep forest green  olive or emerald desu
  and thats it for now weve hit the weekend at last
  nice    blend more    i like the background a lot the coord not so much
  if i take my glasses off for a photo i always end up looking squinty or my eyes arent focused because i cant see shit
  i love this does anyone know what dress it is im awful at identifying solid pieces but i love it
  its by cornet so i dont think theres a specific name and it might be hard to find second hand though you can probably find similar ones easily
  thank you
  i dont think this dress goes well with the apron i like both items but not together
  is no one going to point out how stuffed she looks that looks horrible gulls have gone soft
  what is appealing about being rough on people  i follow her on ig and she just has really big boobs ive seen her in a few ap skirts so its not like shes fuck huge she just has a large upper half
  she wasnt calling her fat she was saying she looks stuffed into the dress big boobs or not shoving yourself into a dress thats too small looks awful
  this  exactly it doesnt look good shes cute and obviously knows how to coord but that dress does not fit her i cant imagine that being comfortable
  she has fairly large legs too it seems i guess she might be short and chubby making her look huge     i think its cute over all but it looks uncomfy and shoving yourself into a dress doesnt mean it fits
  i desperately want to go here
  she looks like a larper
  i love her bag and style she dresses well for her weight
  maybe shes like me and has an awkward af smile i prefer the pouty look anyway
  nice reminds me of the kinds of coords that inspired me when i was new makes me nostalgic
  must be you in the pic because in no world is squishing your cow tits into a dress that is too small for you dressing well for her weight
    looks like she enjoys squishing her body into dresses that are too small for her
welp ild happened going to get a start on a dump as im sure itll be more flooded if i wait
  thats pretty much every single one of her posts she owns some really nice/rare pieces and it makes me sad to see them being destroyed she says she alters them but it sure doesnt look like it
  will be back to dumping in a bit gotta do something really fast dump is far from over
  continuing
gonna dump some too anon sorry for any dupes
    hey dont worry about it  if you want to help thats fine but otherwise i have the time and this is far from the worst dump
    realize i sounded a bit ungrateful thanks though for the help
  and thats it for now
  this is really cute the lighting is a bit unfortunate but i love the coordinate
  she looks trapped by those glasses
  is this an ugly fucking holy lantern replica
  dont buy replicas dont pose like this    i like the cute bears
  wristcuffs are a bit much given the torchon lace but this is actually rather cute    it looks like it its not even the right kind of cut
  cant unsee terrifying face on bag
  oh god i see it too
  fuck you anon i cant unsee it now either
    has cof still not banned replicas are the mods even lolitas idgi
  jesus christ her face is terrifying
  i know you arent a lolita because you think anything with a chandelier is holy lantern rping is trendy but at least try to pretend you can read first     dress is from putumayo
jesus so many coords doing another dump before i drown and while theres still gas in the tank of this thread
  sure anon im not on fb try again
  not even lolita in the slightest wtf isnt cof a lolita group
  while not exactly ita its not exactly pleasing to look at either her hair is nasty as well
  thats it hopefully everyone had a good ild
  god her shoop is always so scary    thanks for dumping anon yer a saint
  it looks like a wig unless her skull is just oddly shaped and has a big lump but of all the wigs to choose
  ive seriously got to admire how she made one of the ugliest dresses ive ever seen to work out
  shoop   shes posted nomakeup photos and thats pretty much just her face i would take supposedly terrifying shoop with nice lighting over something like  any day of the week
ild really brings out the itas and meh tier girls maybe if they dressed up more than twice a year their coords would be better
  that bag is hideous i love it where can i get it
  putumayo is above making vague replicas   youre an absolute retard and it was deleted from cof im sensing youre just a roleplayer yourself or the girl posted desu get some better taste anybody would think thats a shitty hl replica at a glance
cof is not your blog
  blossoms  does she ever wear her clothes outside of photoshoots
  isnt that design pretty common in lolita id say most brands have made a similar one mm vm iw
  she looks really cute makes me regret not getting this dress when it was up for cheap
  then you must think baby makes replicas too because they did a dress with chandeliers then just admit that you assumed something and it was wrong     i see the post was deleted but replicas arent against the rules so it wasnt that
  agreed theres just a lot of mediocrity to scroll past      but shes black anon have some consideration or youre racist uwu
  post your ild coord
  her coords are really cute but the fact that she never cuts her wig bangs fucking kills me
  i personally dont like emerald green as much as olive green so that means its a shit color    tone down your autism
  this looks like what old morbidly obese grandmothers in nursing homes wear
  do those bloomers have little crosses on them does anyone have sauce
  cute coord just wish it was on a girl
  she is a girl thats just an unfortunate angle
  those are the new moitie socks ive heard that the lace is questionable though
  i dont think simply liking it for nostalgia reasons automatically means someone has issues but i have to wonder about the handful of 36 year old women in my comm who still identify exclusively with the schoolchildren and often wear the school uniforms or uniforminspired coords to conventions and meetups its just weird for an adult to want to larp as a 1117 year old kid so badly especially when the series wasnt even really part of their childhood theres one 42 year old woman in particular who still posts waiting for my hogwarts letter statuses on fb and kind of creeps me out with how obsessive she is when youre old enough to be most of the characters mom its probably time to dial it back a bit at least try to identify with the teachers or something
  ha i have a bodyline dress that looks like this
  bodyline    its just a very basic dress
  it looks like she cuts them but just prefers a side swept style i do the same thing
  what is wrong with you why would you say that
  gulls really hate her for being thin and getting lots of attention
  thats really cringeworthy shes a nice girl even if she has anorexia or depression or alcoholism or whatever else people accuse her of get some help anon you obviously have a complex
  cute i just wish she pulled her beret back a little
  short chiffon sleeves in snow  bad pink wig  plain gloves and other bad accessories  so how many asspats did this get on cof     now this is a super cute coord with one of aps sinugly prints     that wig is very pretty but it doesnt really suit her     idk where to even start with this     is this fridgechan an ivory blouse would make it feel more balanced but this is nice     id like to see different tights here those dont match     not a fan of the murdoc niccals hair at all    she always looks so adorable while being refined as well     this is the most unflattering photo ive ever seen     i wish her wig was styled better and that she didnt look like a titan next to that tree but this is cute
  this could be so cute but i wish she had bigger poof desu       these normie cardigans never look right with sweet       i love this it looks like came out of a daily_lolita post circa 2011
  if you cant see the mediocrity of the majority of these coords you must either be blind or one of the girls posted self posting would achieve nothing
  those wings look kinda sad you can see the board they are formed from because theres not enough feathers this was one of the best coords of the event which isnt saying much there where maybe four decently dresses girls but i wouldnt say any one was uh coordinated well lots of mistakes and things that could have been avoided like with this one a better wig and wings with more feathers
  non matching colors  cheap accessories  cosplay wig  short sleeves in the snow   150 likes  i didnt know so many people on cof had shit taste
  well now you know its pretty easy to see that
  if others on cof are like me you like the image just to see them keep trying to either improve or to have some good laughing material down the road
  150 likes isnt a lot tho thats the normal amount unless you took your picture with a potato or youre hideous
  she wears a lot of wigs from brightlele and having owned their wigs myself the bangs are really thin and natural theres no room for error when cutting these bangs theyre usually meant to be worn sideswept so it looks fine
  thats dumb anon someone 42 now wouldve been in their early 20s when the books came out and why is it shocking that adults can relate to a book about kids this may surprise you but adults were once kids no one invested in harry potter literally wants to be a kid     and this is all extra stupid when we are all in a hobby as ridiculous as lolita no one here has any self awareness      considering it now has three incredibly successful theme parks harry potter isnt going anywhere youre going to be stuck hearing about it forever sorry
  good fucking god that face shoop
  what is that wig and joker lipstick please girl love yourself coord is cute besides the makeup/ shoop and wig
at this point cof is so spammed with coords that i think we should just wait for this thread to die before posting the rest     bickering anons where u at
  the tea pot bag pops up on ebay at times it was once a staple for lolita a good while back
  i actually jumped a little when i scrolled down and saw her shoes yikes otherwise pretty cute
  its from an iw event in one of their locations in japan i believe so obviously the girls couldnt wear shoes inside
  yeah dumper here surprised there isnt shit stirring that usually kills threads i have some stuff to do today but if this doesnt die i guess ill throw like 810 coords here i feel its unfair to coords to be thrown at the end of a thread like i personally love to see what people say about my coords but people on the board get mad if you make a new thread while theres stilll an old one
  im glad to help dumping a few in chronological order
  on second thought maybe i should just dump the shitty ones in here so this thread dies from the flaming and we can move on in the next thread
  ngl i like this in a moon kana way but its a little cringey
  whats this dress
  aps ghost night bride iirc    im so tired of seeing bad photos and shitty coords spammed on cof this ild   but then it makes me feel better that most lolitas are indeed quite mediocre and we shouldnt be holding ourselves to impossibly high standards all the time
  theres the last of the meh coords for now
  it makes me feel better that most lolitas are indeed quite mediocre  does it this is a fashion based subculture the fact so many lolitas are painfully unfashionable is depressing
  what dress is this i feel like its brand but it looks awful on her      looks nice other than the wig which i dislike personally
  i agree it depresses me knowing so many terribly dressed people are walking around claiming to be lolita fashion
  
  olive oylchan looks super cute here honestly
  i like this coord and her pose i thought it was unfair she ended up in the ita thread  because of the bad pose with the rest of her meetup crew    keep doing good coords
  well i see it as any other fashion/hobby youll have a lot of mediocre people and just a few really good ones  isnt it normal
      ah thank you forgot to include my bag and parasol in the photo lol ignoring the person who went through my personal fb for the one derp photo ill keep doing my best to improve and further contribute to the community that i love so much my fiancé and i are working on a lolita related video game together id also like to start my own brand one day tired of seeing the same cherry and chocolate prints had some good ideas but financial planning is definitely an immediate must
  you could have made a dump not including this week shes already a joke in one thread
  i suppose it is normal when you put it like that still disappointing to see the overwhelming majority or what seems to be the majority on social media being like this though
  i feel like if you do something like menhera theres no room for fucked up makeup and this is definitely fucked
  that ruffle con thing is amazing
  i see a lot of fantastic stuff on instagram  mostly from people who dont post to cof they take good quality photos and while the coords are subjective they usually look cohesive  there are even some girls who dont match that i enjoy because of photo quality      because you are so well dressed right      i get that you dont like it but most of menhera looks this way
  ruined by bad wig cheap and unstyled this coord is otherwise very cute
  what are those horrifying normie booties in an ott coord like this
  erochan looks great here i am pleasantly surprised i think she is getting better with time
  oh noooo its the lady who wore that corset over a meta piece a while back all the colors were whacko too like shimmery turquoise and violetshe badly needs a mentor or maybe the fashion isnt for her
  nayrt but there is no squishing going at all theres no loaf seam buckling its filled out but isnt straining as an hourglass with a sizeable bust myself this looks fine  it would be baggy and crumpled at the waist if the op was larger this looks fine    i dont understand why people assume busty girls who are not achieving boobloaf experience discomfort as if the dress is binding them looking at the shape of the bodice the lines are soft and the silho is good i commend her for this coord
  i dont think this is a replica of hl this isnt even close to the hl print design  i assumed it was putumayo or some other brand/offbrand casual punk pieces can anyone confirm the source of this piece from her rundown
  iirc there was a chinese company that made a piece very similar to hl and i think that is the dress in the pic it was basically meant to be the taobao version of hl without being a total replica
    yeah i am sorry you got posted
  now this is a cute coord    this wig desperately needs bangs the hairline is distracting i would remove the puffy ankle warmers since they dont blend with that type of shoe those two things addressed this would be a decent coord    very nice
  disagree with other anon the cardi here looks good
  whatever youre remembering this isnt it
  ah youre right it was the little devils emblems dress i was thinking of and now that i looked back at a pic its quite different from that girls dress
  this isnt even menhera though its guro   menhera is like a casual mix of yumekawaii/pastel jfash and spoopy medical themes lots of tshirts and jumpers and shit    agree the weird undereye shadow is highly questionable   this def needs poof but this is a refreshing guro coord overall
anyone going to start a new thread theres probably a backlog of coords from ild
  sorry you got posted    in the closet of frills thread are you goddamn retarded or is it just role playing like we all know it is
  i love this so much but i really wish the apron was longer    oh no those peep toe shoes    not lolita    the silhouette is really nice in this    she looks like a fucking zombie
  nayrt but the whole sorry you got posted thing has become a meme are you new
  dump anon here and done with my stuff today ill be getting one going here in a jiffy there is indeed a lot itll take more than an hour to post everything rip      thank you so much for helping fill this thread anon
  literally nobody likes fantastic beasts
  she has been in the fashion for years and has well dressed friends ive seen her older coords and they seem alright but she seems to be in some weird corset experimental phase and it looks so bad  but its not like shell listen to advice and i dont think her friends want to help her so she has fallen down into the hole of being boss level ita
  no worries we appreciate you dump anon
  it being a meme is what makes it very unlikely i dont post cof so  is wrong
  godspeed anon

tread cause jcon is dead
any ket
thread is deader than jcons trade hall
this is uh something
eirtakon will never return to the non kiddy pandering days of 2013  feels bad man
so how bad is jcon did it improve at all from last year i know its a con in it early stages but is there any potential for it to be the next eirtakon
  its worse than last year trade hall was awful and the same guest is bad idea
i went to a con in dublin once    boy was that a fucking mistake
anyone heading to ireland comic con next weekend
  t bogwarrior
  anytime i see this the idea to run a con rears its ugly head again and it starts doing the evil thing of making sense    until i look at the budget and concepts id drawn up for a 350400 person level event with no fucking guest and laugh myself stupid again its at least a 2 year runin with a 12 month actual work schedule and thats without even knowing what exactly it would cost     the amount of work involved is not something doable when im also grinding ten hours a day putting my arse imprint in a ten euro in an office chair     not to mention im pretty much the person nobody would wantr to work for you need a certain amount of charisma and drive and general people skills and im about 15 20 years behind the curve on that    on the plus side at least im aware of that fucking problem but good god is it infuriating     pic is from kaizokukon 17
  also    either their marketing person sucks  because this is literally the first ive heard of it    or im finally getting to old for this shite and nobodys sponsering fb posts at me
that was terrible
holy jaysus it was this weekend was eirtakon and its knockoff jcon not traditionally supposed to be in november
ruh roh
  just dumpin some old photos of better tiems
  i dont even know how thats upside down
  ive got a lot of stuff from these cons but ill call it here or ill be at it all night     i still think 2015 was the best year
  also    why the fuck did none of my corrections and rotations stick again
was it at least better than shurikon that was fucking miserable
my god this thread is sad  is this what the con scene in ireland is unattractive barelyliterate broke people paying more money than theyre willing to part with to stand in a boring venue filled with other unattractive barelyliterate broke people and complain about it anonymously afterwards
  well theres already been a few public complaints about it on their facebook but what the fuck do ye expect here 4chan is supposed to be anonymous and its not like theyre going to take any feedback on board even if you do have a moan at them on facebook anyway
heard thete was some edgelord walking around with a hoody that was covered in hentai and when he was asked to remove it his mum got really aggressive
  when he was asked to remove it his mum got really aggressive  holy fuck absolutely based
    about three or four people had the same hoody its something that looks like they got it off wish an all over black and white print  lots of ofaces and liquid dripping out of mouths
imagine forking out that much money to run a con and it being that shit other nonprofit cons around the country do better jobs than this
  imagine forking out that much money to run a con and it being that shit    we have     why do you think therere no more cons in ireland nobody else is left who knows much about what theyre doing and anyone who tries tries to go big early rather than build the experience
shoutout to adam    gas the prods
lads mcm is a joke right now different rds building this year no signs of where it is i bought the saturday general entry and was given a weekend ticket the autograph guests are late at their tables typical mcm being typical mcm
all jcon had going for it was the venue really ive been both years and this year was pretty much a carbon copy of last year same guests panels and events but now over two days hell i wouldnt be surprised if all the trade hall stands were in the exact same position as last year
anyone get pics of 2booty yesterday lads
  theres qcon akukamkon and kaizokukon left     kaizokukon is good but its started to feel samey its not fun anymore    i havent been to the others because id be going by myself and thats not fun i dont know anyone anymore
  its sad really too many egos in the cosplay community right now i miss when it you could have a bit of banter with people now people are too up their own arse
  the internet and instagram have ruined everything fun all this digital social media shite just makes everyone misereable
ehh ill agree this years jcon didnt feel at all different from last years the best part is just getting incharacter and playing them out i myself was acting incharacter and that was better than anything the con itself has on offer
was everyones favourite podcast geekeire there
  akumakon is great imo because it has plenty of 18 events which a lot of cons are seriously in need of even if you go by yourself the pub quiz is great and youll probably end up making friends on the night me and my bf go alone and we make an effort to call people over to our table who look lost lol
  if i was going to akumakon id likely be going alone     and if you think your average congoer is terrible at making friends youve never met me like compolete live in a fucking greybox for 30 years level social ineptitude
  i must say that sounds appealing but getting my ass over from dublin and finding a place to stay in galway for a night is too much effort
bump from tralee lads  ill be up to ye soon
is this bint actually trying to get people to trade in their games to get her pokémon bitch better have beer filled tits and a magic vajay jay
  what are her tits like
    absolute babe
i remember my last con was like eirtakon 2016 or something i spent like 12 minutes in the main hall then i went outside and spent most of my time getting stoned with my friends maybe we are all just growing out of cons like when i was 15 cons were fun as shit but now i just realize that im paying 25 euro to go into a room filled with expensive shit and sweaty nerds trying to pick up cosplayers with bfs i miss the old naive days
i miss just chatting without being asked do you have a cosplay page or patreon     i dont think i have the thot powers that would make it profitable    also im not a cunt that would rob people with shit cosplay photos once a month
so theres some game con this weekend anyone going
  rob people  people willingly give money its not robbery dont make an us vs them thing doesnt help the cosplay scene and acting not like the other girls is cringe
sad to see this is the state of the irish con scene now
  getting this worked up defending patreon thots  oy vey
  gamer con
any good cons happening within the next year
  dcc spring edition and regular dcc you either hate or love the other cons theres shurikon but thats pretty small theres some con in northern ireland thats not half bad i hear but besides that i cant really help you anon as i said you either hate or love them
  theres some con in northern ireland thats not half bad i hear    qcon    i went for a day i think it was good but a bit expensive i was sick as hell so i might be misremembering pain in the arse to get money changed for a day trip though
alguien sabeque personaje va a hacer postea sobre una tela azul y zapatos tipo lolita pero no aclara que personaje acaso es un cosplay sexy 
  si buenos dias donde esta el bano
tell me about your local cringlords /cgl/
  80 of my con attendees  no theys not teenagers at all
i know this probably sounds like bait but honestly the biggest cringe lords are me and my coworker were going to do some trash lolita photo shoots soon and im planning on doing some stupid edgy goth shit soon
sf local here sorry for the low quality image but this is all she ever uploads this woman is a local cringe shes a 40 year old lady who dresses up as sailor moon and works multiple jobs in japantown because the children need her there shes an event nightmare as well since she forces herself into most of the japantown events the best way to describe her is she acts like one of those character of city/state cosplayers who do chairty events except she doesnt contribute anything and wants to be the center of every japantown event     she was partnered with that online game tinierme but once it shut down she tried staying relevant ever since she even recently reused her old tinierme graphics to make overpriced low quality merch that none bought i guess its not so much cringe but sad does anyone else in sf also know her
fred is finally on cgl pfff hes nowhere the worst
  shut up jebus he is a creep and is trying to use people for popularity without giving a damn about what they do if he stopped harassing events to let him perform he wouldnt have such a negative light on him only someone as cringy as you would care about him
  not to mention this isnt the first or last time he is posted none is san antonio likes him if i wanted to be harassed to take a shitty mix tape or filmed without consent id go to austin or la
    what did this guy do
i got san no real explanation needed even though now he thinks going to colossalcon east makes him east coast despite living in ohio     note he has never even made a shirt before in his life
  my fave sanposts  oh shit i cant find the can opener for this chef boyardee i guess its off to olive garden  talking about wanting to privatize his cosplay commissions nigga thought private business meant its secret or underground taxfunded cosplay amirite  crying about how hes been awake for over 14 hours   his discovery of what overtime at work is at the ripe age of 26   this is besides over all the constant jealous reeeeing at women and the selfdiagnosed angsty titles and exaggerations like hero anti hero black knight con terrorist because his friends airsoft gun got banned at a convention center where the president of the united states was at witch hunt victim researcher because he looks up how to make cosplays thats it 9s teacher etc it goes on forever
  fresh from today every post he makes is just laced with bitterness
  shocker
  hahahah  ohio   east coast
i live in las vegas and there are too many cringey people to count them the worst one is probably momokun though
      is this the guy who floods all the texas cons to be a guest for his music skills    i know theres another kid like this but tries to be an anime comedian that does the same thing    if a texas con has this guy its a good sign their staff doesnt check for programming quality or guest quality
britbong here    theres this one guy where i live who acts like hes the core of our cosplay community hes right up his own ass about his mediocre at best cosplay skills  examples has a 3 or 4 year old wig that he wears for every costume that he just paints and restyles for each character   buys ebay costumes then claims he made them even though the most crafting hes ever done is a shitty foam sword for a loz costume  goes on massive rants on facebook about toxic cosplay behaviour whenever someone criticises his costumes or offers tips on how to improve them   related to point above i a complete hypocrite that makes fun of other low effort cosplays people often teenagers wear to any local conventions he goes to posts them in an album he calls his cringe compilation most of them arent even actually cringey just done on a super cheap budget  is 28 still hits on the 17/18 year olds at conventions   i could go on with specific things hes done over the years but i dont want to make an even larger wall of text
  should be is a complete hypoocrite
  oof
  do you know the weird matrix loving looking guy who wants to start his own cult he lives there and hes def on my list of cringiest people ive met
  woah no never met that guy does he go to cons
after reading through this thread and seeing a lot of cringe from texas it reminded me of this dude i only know of him because he ranted about delta h con on the cons facebook group but he does this with other cons too    
  yes and no sometimes does he used to be a btard and started browsing cgl to make fun of me and my friends
no one really on my end other than the toe sucker himself
  had to click out 5 seconds in
  hes horrible in person full tard thats not an act
  who else im new to vegas need to know who i should watch out for
  i do but i think shes a sweetheart she just likes to cosplay and perform who cares what her age is   polite sage for no actual contribution
  oh my god ill never forget the sailor moon event he asked me to vendored at he stuck us outside in 100 degree weather infront of a gross weeb shop and i was pissed i didnt make a single penny that day after the event he began blaming two weeb store for taking his crowd i was just starting out at the time but if i knew how he really was i wouldnt have accepted
  prudent
  ah san hes grown to by far be one of my favorite people to laugh/cringe at for how obnoxiously full of himself he is even though he is very mediocre    my favorite was when he ranted about how seeing props that arent absolutely accurate make him cringe and dont get him started on guns 
  females  how to spot a neckbeard 101 they refer to women as females actual physical neckbeard not required
  ive noticed this too its super weird because i think theyre trying to sound polite and clinical but still use men over males most of the time  i use chicks or women if i need to be more formal
  this sounded just like joeysworldtour at the start
      he sounds like a cockgobbler faggot but he doesnt it doesnt seem like hed be the worst out there kinda feel like there are tons of his type in the con community   surely there has so be worse
    oh my god i had forgotten about this guy i had run inside with him years ago when i would vend at texas cons he was a big fanboy    im not sure if hes on the spectrum but i wouldnt be surprised      texas being as large as it is and being so saturated with cons we read have a list of cringe    aside from jebus i would have to say erin/fatespinner just an overall cringy asshole with an ego and awkward as fuck
    90 of the time its because they mean women and girls but either do not want to type it all out or do not want to tip people off that they are massive pedos
  erin/fatespinner    is this person trans or a really ugly woman
    trans i think
  aside from jebus i would have to say erin/fatespinner just an overall cringy asshole with an ego and awkward as fuck    oh god ive ran into him at san japan his rapping if you wanna call it that is whack but he thinks hes hot shit
  i met this dude at katsu last year and thought nothing of him other than the fact he talked a whole fucking lot and rooted his own horns until i followed him back on insta and twitter i could only handle following him for a month before i heard about the shit he pulls on girls lmfao
  is there a difference lol
  i actually do think hes the worst the problem with san is its hard to really incapsulate five years of constant and unchanging hypocrisy narcissism chad larp anger sexism racism and im not even someone who sees that everywhere like a lot of people he really is those things jealousy inability to apologize and admit wrong and inability to deliver a worthy commission in just a few screencaps especially since he makes multiple posts daily were talking 5 sometimes average 2 a day one day ill make some compilations
  you can just say women and it does the same thing
  before i heard about the shit he pulls on girls lmfao  pls elaborate
  the difference is that only one of them is actually a woman
  from what ive seen he tends to give them extra attention and will be super nice or try really hard to impress them very typical manipulative creep tactics whats weird is that hell always try to befriend younger girls so that he can play the senior in the relationship
omg i went to see that instagram in the collage for curiosity and jfc those horrible armors
  those poor fucking cats
      this doesnt have the revenge porn caps though i dont think i will post it he also constantly shares kawaii asian lewd cosplayers while complaining that he doesnt want to see swimsuitsuccubus welloiled ass on his feed so i thought he just was a yellow fever faggot but then pic related he is clearly just highly jealous of anyone with an ounce of popularity especially women     his parents may be hoarders because yes he still lives with his parents at nearing 27 he once complained about 400 rent being too expensive so it makes me think he was living rentfree and they finally got tired of his shit lol
dutch gull here we have someone who calls himself trainer steevee basically an old guy walking around in the same pokemon outfit with 12plushies thinking everyone likes him and thinks he is funny    he also does vlogs in dutch   
  erin  you mean aaron carter his real name yeah the dudes been a complete asshole since i met him thinks hes hot shit and tried to date girls back around 2012 but when his ex broke up with him and he couldnt get a gf he went trans to gain sympathy basically just a texas con anthony burch
  he couldnt get a gf he went trans to gain sympathy    this seems to be a common occurrence a voice actor did the same thing until he got laid and married the woman
  i got stuck rooming with him at katsu last year because some girl in our multi room group vouched for him but then they had a falling out and we found out what a piece of shit he was for whatever reason he wasnt kicked out and he was put in my room and like not with the girl who brought him in in the first place and he was horrible  he stayed in the room like 80 of the con it seemed and he just kept painting his props and drying them with a heat gun releasing fumes throughout our room he also complained about how everyone was out to get him hes a total creep
  the big cosplayers out here are  momokun is a sexual predator and egotistical just google it   gabby cooke cosplay doesnt make most of her stuff and ex friends of momokun till the sexual harassment stuff came out and money dried up super fake if you ever talk to her   steffvonschweets does great work and hosts panels at conventions mostly okay but a little full of herself     there are other people here in vegas but those are the ones i can name off the top of my head
  lol of course they had a falling out he cant ever stay friends with girls wonder why
  does anyone have a way to contact the owner of that imgur album ive got some additional stuff to add to the evidence pile i have vague evidence to the existence of him planning on releasing revenge porn as well as some more recent stuff
  her name is abbie kousaka on fb this was all made and posted by her before youmacon last year on the youmacon everyone security page san thinks the only person who hates him and witch hunts him is that girl lol
  mainlanders are dicks
  oooooo care to share some of the dirt on this board as well i love seeing this guy act like a moron
  bbut anon its not his fault he ever does anything bad ever
      ahh this dude again how has he not been shunned by the wider ohio community at this point considering all the people hes pissed off and fucked over
  of course its a common occurrence half the trans comm is people looking for attention because they couldnt get it from the opposite sex
    and the ex is also trans now
this girl suddenly popped up in my area and is selfproclaiming herself as a kawaii ambassador yikes
  im friends with her maybe share some here and i can send them her way
the biggest cringelord cosplayer i came across was a friend who was a few years under me in school he dreamed of starting his own dictatorship and would walk around in daily life in boots blue denim overalls a red tshirt and a navy puffer vest ironically the boots and maybe the shirt where the only things he wasnt too big for saying it was the uniform everybody was going to be wearing and that the color of the shirt would relate to what job the person had now hes a furry
  socute lmao  yea
not really a cringelord but a local thot this is the most starved for attention skank ive ever seen she recently made two huge posts about how shes genderfluid sure will
    i can smell that picture
  towers
  brrrraaaaaaaap
  her face is more manly than mine and im a slav
  zdravo fellow slav bitch
  the caption makes it sound like she fucks her dog
  her dog looks disgusted/ashamed
  my reaction
  if she makes money off of being a thot report her to the irs
    my thoughts exactly fucking disgusting i hope shes just a moron and isnt actually a dogfucker im super op would have mentioned if she was
  i dont think she is but that doesnt stop her from taking weirdass nude photos with him i dont know her irl
  not cosplay but a good pic of how disgusting she
  the only problem with this is sharing it publically
  id scritch that pooch right behind the ears
the salt mine that never stops delivering    last thread
    wish i could sell you one but im one of the plebeian masses waiting for a ticket and trying to weight the pros and cons of going
  any new salt
am i blind or are the posts regarding the ticket registration and general information about the ticket sale gone
if this turns out bad you know they will complaining about lack of volunteers like tpc
  yep tried to find it the other day and its g o n e
   does that mean if you havent registered before you cant try buying a ticket now well fuck me for waiting on them revaling all their guests
  you need to register to get a ticket regardless so the post wouldnt help you it just told you the tiers and amounts     i hope it means they are going to repost it with a new info or another way besides an email of the link
i feel so weird about people immediately jumping in to write posts in the sfe group about how much they love sfe its like positively reinforcing their bad behavior in regards to not taking criticism being dismissive of concerns and talking shit about people on their personal facebooks
  the post said you could register till march so i guess that still applies
  the post with the ticket tier pricing info is still in the group
  plus one is long time friends with k and the others are german girls probably trying to avoid another ticketgate
    i honestly feel sorry for the ones that actually speak up against them publicly they seem to get marked as troublemakers the moment they disagree one too many times
  double post but i want to be clear that i dont include k in this though i do think is weird that she got a mail despite being considered an unwelcome shitstirrer
  but what is the email address what do you put in it
    just read the text
i dont wanna shit stir but its interesting to know that apparently the british organiser has been offering presale links to some of her close friends fishy i cant verify that though its just a rumour floating around
  this sounds fake as fuck who is going around saying this receipts please
  well if anon has this information then they probably dont wanna out themselves lmao
  or they could be lying to stir shit
  possibly but by posting here its pretty risky to lie
did you guys get that crock of shit email  you were rude so no more tickets   just admit that you fucks wanted a private party with your friends
  especially they punish us because other persons critize them wtf  i just hope many of these sfe is so wonderful posters dont have a ticket yet either
  literally what is the risk no one knows who posted it if anything its way less credible for being posted here im not happy with what sfe are doing either but come on at least theres evidence for the rest of the drama this is just completely out of the blue and seems ridiculous
  wait has there been more instances of this or are you referring to how d and k got their tickets revoked
  i dont want to stir shit  i cant verify  its a rumour    why are you posting then
  this is the email that was sent out to people that registered it was sent today in the afternoon i would still like to go and i hope i can but the wording of this is confusing to me
  they basically are saying they were planning on adding more tickets and maybe doing something else to make sure everyone can go and had fun now they are not so any talk of adding like more tea party tickets isnt happening     it still means there is another sale you are still able to go the 2 day crystal dream tickets did not sell out
  deets or gtfo
  did you get that what did you do
  what did the first part say despite what
  its really funny to me how you think doubling down like this is going to help it just proves their point i wouldnt want to organise stuff for people who acted like toddlers
  also who doxxed them thats so weird
  guessing she means the wedding pictures she mentioned before
  well for me the only ones acting like toddlers are the organizers themselves never seen such an unprofessional email
  what is unprofessional about it surely keeping attendees informed is what they should be doing
  whining about the community while there was only reasonable criticism is unprofessional also now they punish all lolitas who have nothing to do with the whole drama and when they really have the problem with the german laws i really dont know why they dont work together with one of the german lolita comms
  it sounds more like they dont have the people power/ resources to do a bigger event because they cant get more volunteer organisers to help them probably because everyone is shit scared of the way the community behaves     i wouldnt be shocked if an org or two has dropped out off the back of this
  whats reasonable about threatening to sue or doxxing
  how did you know about this though
  i know at least one comm offered them help but they refused    as far as i know they react to the drama from the beginning of the week and there was no doxxing and and thinking about calling a lawyer after someone refuse to give you your paid tickets is not threatening the doxxing happened way before so it cant be the real reason of the mail
  your syntax really gives away that youre k its proper funny
  well im not  maybe its just my shitty german syntax
  lol those tickets were refunded no one is keeping the money
  sorry but its also not possible to give your tickets back after paying so why it should be okay for the organizers
  the tickets were refunded and the people involved were explicitly told they could still buy tickets in the normal sale no laws broken no money stolen this has been blown wildly out of proportion i fully blame these two cunts for the fact im probably not going to be able to get a ticket
  this is how all events work organisers can refuse entry for whatever reason they like happens at nightclubs festivals concerts plays people get turned away all the time and often without a refund so these two have actually been extended a nice courtesy
  no it has not im actually proud of the girls and that they made official statements protect the orga if you want but they behave unprofessional if you cant deal with fishy lolitas you should stop doing this its a business
  proud of yourself you mean
  nice try gurl
  its literally not a business honestly im not trying to defend them and im enjoying this whole thing go to hell as much as the next guy but this is something made for 0 benefit sometimes even losing money so not a business
  i havent said that the event is a business but dealing with the lolitas is like dealing with customers so this part is a business
i still want to go how can i go
  if you have registered they send you a ticket link
  i know your grasp of english is poor but this is a really important distinction this is not a business that would involve profit organisation would be a better word in this situation
  just a quote from the english business dictionary businesses can be privately owned notforprofit or stateowned  sorry
            for all the rest of the drama on here suddently this one is all oh so fake we cant believe baseless lies your samefag whiteknighting makes me believe this more    55 replies 20 posters just let that sink in
  lets just say one of the people in the the little group isnt the nicest friendliest person in the world someone whos bitter and has far too much time on her hands
  i believe you i just really want some solid proof so we can ask about it
  has she told her friends she has done that or just sent them out silently i dont know of anyone personally who got a link who didnt volunteer or attend all events
  unfortunately giving proof would mean outing the girl and half the comm who know     she told them as far as i know they had never attended or volunteered
  if shes not the nicest friendliest person in the world why dont you
  for fucks sake three of those are literally a conversation i had with an anon the rest is all different people though is it really that hard to believe that multiple people may want proof of a pretty serious accusation      oh come the fuck on just post your fucking receipts or go gloat somewhere else
  did anyone take her up on that offer
  so i was right about half of your posts thats not great for you
  there would be pretty large consequences im content not causing huge drama in the comm     no they politely refused thankfully
  im really not gloating just adding something to the conversation since it seems theres a lot to be suspicious about
  i had a conversation with another anon you fucking walnut samefagging is when one anon tries to look like a bunch of different people at no point did i do that and posted i the caps to prove it now please provide the caps for your stupid rumours oh wait you wont because youre a fucking coward
  not content causing huge drama  causes huge drama by outing one of her friends as a shit talker    the person who told you probably knows who you are so why not just go balls to the wall and tell
  lol is it a mod
  she told a lot of people id just rather not throw literally everyone in the comm under the bus over this i know its not worth much but trust me when i saw the british organiser has been offering presale links to her closest friends
  fake news prove it
why is asking for proof of something now considered to be on the same line as supporting sfe blindly     but additionally you will have to be blind to still insist that everything is dandy despite sfe clearly fucking up and cant bring themselves to fess to it instead pissing off potential attendees    both sides are messed up keep going though i have a lot of popcorn to eat
  thats what it looks like given the avoidance
did everyone got this mail today  im registered but recieved nothing
  so far there was two different emails sent at different times one sent to people who had attended an event before and one sent to those who had not after that
i was just pondering about how sfe is going to recover from this shitfest they arent very good at owning up to or covering up any of their mistakes so they keep pissing more and more people off     buuuut considering this community has the memory of a seagull all of this will most likely be forgotten and forgiven by the next event kek
  theres only like four people who are kicking off about this and hundreds who are totally fine so yeah its not gonna cause problems in future
  if they do a good and less exclusive event next time then all will be fine i dont hold sfe any ill will but they got off on the wrong foot this time and have mishandled theyre not professionals so the pr mess can be understood were making a big deal out of all this but its really not a big deal there are other events to go to
  actually its the other way around 99 of the people only lurk on the internet they dont post and on top of that people are afraid to speak up about controversial things like this all of my friends are pissed off about this but they dont go on cgl afaik and they would certainly never make a post about it on facebook
  same several people i know have discussed this and are just as upset as most others are but they are  1 not very keen on committing social suicide by saying anything publicly   2 while some of them browse cgl they dont care for posting the others dont care for cgl at all    so yeah a lot of people are pissed off by this not because of theyre concerned about tickets but because of how unprofessionally its being handled
welp i feel bad posting this and confirming everyones fears but here it goes it does seem that sfe is becoming more exclusive and purposefully gatekeepy the events are going to become smaller and more intimate theyre no longer going to concentrate on guests but more on creating a vacation get away with friends     with that i hope other large event groups like hellocon and the group in barcelona take up where they left off desu someone else should these girls seem beat and have all but given up
  too big well sure but if we can have large anime cons why cant we have a lolita con theres no such thing as too big  intimate events are just comms surely  inb4 lolicon jokes
    obviously there are many reasons to be pissed off my comm is not happy with the situation either but still some of the stuff in this thread and the previous one seems flat out unreasonable and vendetta there are legit concerns and salt and it can be hard to tell the two apart im not surprised sfe is struggling to respond to the criticism we love to yell about people not taking crit but also not all crit is useful or helpful
  i hope youre all happy now youve ruined things for those of us who havent been spreading shit and would have liked to go to sfes events but never managed to get a foot in the door
  rufflecon tried and died
  at least they tried
  sfe never wanted to be a con anyway if you want one so bad run it yourself
  i literally dont see the issue with this id rather go to an event with welldressed friends than have to deal with noobs and weebs who come to big conlike events    you arent entitled to someone organising a big event for you
  im a lonelita i dress well ive been wearing this fashion for years have over 1000 followers on ig id love to go to an sfe event but ive been too poor until this time but im never going to get my foot in the door now i think id fit in but ill never have a chance thats the kind of thing that bothers people
  of course you have to take some criticism with a grain of salt but atm they seem to really have taken water over their heads and not fully realized that arranging an event is not the same as arranging a meet because while some of this might have been acceptable in a private meet again might depends on the comm it does not work when you are handling an event where people from all over the world might be interested     i arrange nonprofit events myself and have done on and off for years and its easy to see from some of the organizers reactions that they are panicking because they dont know how to handle the situation now that theyre knee deep in a mess they didnt count on due to inexperience you dont need to have tough skin when you arrange anything but whenever you do any event available to the public eye you will get criticism whether its warranted or not but i am however confused about how this is seeping out in their every way of possible communication there has to be someone in that group that can be a calming voice of reason that tell them to calm down and think things through properly     i dont know anything about the organizers behind the event nor sfe so maybe some of my points are moot
  so entitled     im almost glad you weirdos have been having tantrums over this a smaller event means dealing with fewer of you wastes of space
  not saying sfe needs to be a con just saying its not the worst idea ever im not forcing anyone to make a con really and plus itd probably thrive best as a multifashion con rather than just lolita if you incorporate other jfashion you could probably get something decent     but what would i know im just some anon speculating ive not run anything before      you dont like the idea i do its called having a different opinion im not entitled just saying itd be fun    and on a different note if you thought this isnt just the organizers turning round and saying were not allowed because were meanies and they were actually going to do anything anyway youre deluded
    i also enjoy larping
  yikes i guess even somewhat neutral posts arent allowed in here     in my entire post i was giving the organizers the benefit of the doubt is that still not enough for you
  accusing people of larping when theyre being quite constructive in what theyre saying and one is even saying shed like to go to sfe  im almost starting to believe the organizers are in this thread who else would be this salty
  accusing people of larping when theyre being quite constructive in what theyre saying and one is even saying shed like to go to sfe  im almost starting to believe the organizers are in this thread who else would be this salty
  my friends are only angry about the tickets and nothing else mainly about people who have been to previous events but did not donate or volunteer getting access to the presale
  the group in barcelona  afaik the omnia vanitas was largely organised by international sfe staff with only one moderator of the catalunya comm doing all of the local work there are never big lolita events in barcelona maybe you meant the one in madrid
  has this actually happened ive seen lots of talk of it but no evidence i didnt get pre sale and i had been to 3/4 events
  a lot of lolitas solely to go these events because its the only time they can shop brand in person
    sfe was initially created to organise big events with other jfashions besides lolita but with a focus on lolita this is the first year they appear to be trying to be smaller instead of bigger      people who went to all 4 events got a presale link for sure only 1 person in my comm got it
  i mean they have referred to it on their fb pages so they confirmed are at least reading
  i know from at least two or three american lolitas who managed to get tickets in presale and non of them ever was on a sfe event before or never donated
  caps   i just dont want more unnecessary rumors flying around this is already a mess but at least keep it an organised mess so we know for sure whats fact and whats just rumors
  i dont understand why anyone would read cgl if they are as sensitive as this the wking has been so obvious and while some posters have made more serious and personal accusations even the reasonable questions and concerns are being joked about its so unprofessional and not at all what i expected from sfe considering what great stuff theyve pulled off in the past     all people wanted was transparency and now sfe have made more problems for themselves
  low quality posts like this arent going to get us any answers or explanations from sfe     it is definitely worth asking why so many non europeans are involved in the organisation though ive seen us and aus so far
  honestly you mentioned the thing so youve already done it anyways
  because they want to whine about it in their hugbox and people are so desperate to curry favor they swarm and asspat and tell them they are great and feed their fragile egos the same as the people writing the public posts shouting about how much they love them
  what i wouldnt give to be a fly on the wall of the london comm rihtg now
  we have a group chat and honestly noones bothered
  would you tell us if they were bothered however are you just saying that
  look at my face is this face bovvered tickets bovvered sfe bovvered i aint bovvered
    the main organisers were spanish but only one was from barcelona afaik
  literally nobody is talking about it only cgl
  its already mentioned up thread why you would not say anything publicly and in a chat that includes an organizer it would be the same as doing it publicly no one wants to commit social suicide
  people keep leaving the orga every year not surprised theyre going smaller
  orgy
  except the organizer isnt in this chat
  the london comm stopped giving a flying fuck about k a long time ago desu
    t not london gulls
  lmao tell me about it
  oh any particular reason as someone in another comm that isnt something we have any info on and had the impression you all still cared
  she still comes to meets sometimes and we still like her but shes no big deal
  yeah she doesnt do tpc anymore so she isnt really special shes just part of the comm and quite nice like a regular person plus there are a lot of new comm members in recent months and they dont really know how big she used to be for the community
  dont want to out it or else my ticket goes bye bye  are they not going to post the email contents to facebook page
  cgl isnt the place for facts dear
  no the main orgsniser of omnia vanitas was from the catalunya comm the others were from the normal sfe team the grand embassy was in madrid organised by spanish lolitas
  coming here to bitch and spread shit even though youre going yourself you are a coward and a hypocrite i hope you get found out and banned from their events forever
  i know how its going to sound but its odd how nervous people are about speaking out or publicly ask questions now not only because there is now a risk of losing tickets but also because of the social throwback it almost like sfe went from an eventgroup and turned into the jfash mafia lol    and before someone gets their bloomers in a twist im joking
  why the fact that i feel they handled the situation really wrongly but cant speak up at all or else will get a very negative reaction thats bad on sfe organizer part ofcourse i want to go so i can see friends that live in different country doesnt mean i cant be unhappy about the event organization
  being unhappy about an events organization and spreading unsubstantiated rumours about an organizer whom a lot of people have a weird hateboner for arent the same thing smells like a vendetta
  that anon literally only asked a question how are they spreading rumors
  this here is a perfect example of why people are mad if you used to organize the biggest events in europe with interesting guests of course people will expect that your new event will be the same but if you chose to change the format of your event without telling people before hand and just let people wonder about certain things regarding your event of course people will be fucking mad why not be like hey folks this is our new event this year we shifted foucs from big event to a smaller more familiar scale right when you announce it yes there still would have been complaints about getting too exclusive but thats a thing you decided on and should stand up against instead of whining that people are meanies
  right they should have said this from the start   example  we are making smaller events for x reason  presale ticket qualifications are x y  z  people need to register in advance and give a b  c information  ticket link in advance with the information that it will be live at x time to avoid any late received mails    simple clear professional why cant a group of seemingly intelligent 30something women hash out this details in advance
  intimate events is what local comms are for this is a cop out if they wanted to do a smaller event they couldve just said so from the start not everyone would be happy but it wouldnt be so confusing and dodgy and they wouldnt have had so much backlash     the events dont have to be huge all the time its just shitty that they created so much hype around the event only to drop this on everyone they were painting it to be the biggest sfe event yet or at least the most exciting i keep wanting to believe that theyre not make it super exclusive and inner circley but they keep proving me wrong im disappointed they should have just been honest from the start
  this would have been perfect and sure some people might have been salty but they would have been honest about the details at least if theyd come clean people wouldve understood
  this  i know one girl on ig who is friends with one of the organizers and got a link to pre sale shes never been to an sfe event nor has she donated
  the problem is not criticism though the problem is how it was posted that girl k posted about how the ticket was late and how it was not fair and then proceeded to whine about it publicly and after this she threatened them with a lawyer it really makes sense that a lot of the volunteers would say you know what fuck it after that  and then you had retarded horse girl posting about how sfe is lyiing to us in a conspiracy kind of tone to keep fetishists out when did that become a bad thing and criticizing how they are not a real organization who cares why do you need it to be a real organization in order to host parties for people to gather together parties and events are good things in which we get to have fun the fact that someone organizes them should be enough imho  id honestly not be surprised if this is their final event
  this yes they messed up many time but the reaction has been really disproportionate and weird    i feel like what did this is two things first the long time before they released the location making people nervous and ready to nitpick that primed the bomb and then the pastattendants only thing confirmed all those concerns and made established lolitas who just hadnt attended before and especially many lolitas from the euro community feel excluded its like a parody of the lolita elitists we all like to say dont exist except it was real life kind of felt like if you cant get in youre a loser of course people got angry and then sfe seemed like it was scolding them for wanting to go at all    everything after that is a lot of actionreaction with bad moves on every side the worst being whoever sent racist emails and doxxed people and threatened legal action over a stupid email of course they would become more exclusive after that no one would want those people at their event i also think this could be sfes last event sadly
    you should have posted it yourself publicly if youre so great at it
  posted what that makes no sense
  criticism both of you are only criticising things anonymously lol even a girl who rightfully felt unfairly cheated
  the english orga mentioned under ds post that the questioning after registration was to make sure that you are  not a predatory old man  so they seem to have had problems with that  and the topic with the organization was probably related to the fact that sfe is trying to organize the event privately as soon as it is considered public in germany you have to observe much more laws regarding fire protection music etc even if you are a private organizer so it is understandable that sfe wants to avoid this
    when in doubt just claim your side was doxxed
  she wasnt even cheated out of anything she got the tickets originally  she just wanted to complain anyways and got herself into trouble over it and they declined to be civil over email but wanted to pout some more and make a fb post and blow it up referenced the post on insta and made it public on fb dumb girls     personally i think giving crit is better once its all done a lot of this over reaction is based on things that havent happened like the idea that anyone could scam the presale didnt happen you cant just buy for anyone and hoard tickets it wasnt everyone who went in the past but a few who went to all etc complaining about what ifs arent useful crit
  right like where is the proof that happened i have seen nothing doxxed where somewhere no one has seen what info
  and the girl that was denied access to the ticket sale cause she had no social media thats not something that should have been mentioned beforehand
  no her friend got the tickets because the email was late if she had tried via the late email she wouldnt have got the ticket afaik so she was complaining about the late email  the rest was overkill desu
  it went too far obviously but the point that if you didnt have a friend to buy and got the email late that you would be potentially screwed is valid they are always plagued by technical issues every time tpc as well when it comes to the sales and they never seem to learn its frustrating
  she was actually told that if she didnt want info about her collected they would not do it but that means they cant continue with registering her she was unwilling to prove she was a lolita horse girl just exaggerated the story check the email again posted last thread and check what horse girl said as it wasnt about not having fb      she did get her email late but her friend got her tickets minutes in and her friend technically said she got it before 7 and she had a ticket at 702 she had the tickets the whole 40 minutes she was posting about it being late on the ticket thread all she needed to post was hey i got my tickets through a friend but my email didnt show up in time check on that for text time
  here is just the part with the email notice the email the girl sent us i wont give you info and then going into this boring cgl argument about laws and stuff the email sfe sent back was sorry you feel this way and we will not get your info so you cant register     we do now know they are making sure ppl arent creeps and this person wouldnt really play ball
  and here is the part where actually they got their tickets at 701 actually she had her ticket and didnt disclose it and in this situation there isnt much you can do about when people got their emails anyways but the act was what fucked them notice the how unfair part too she wasnt trying to give crit but to start something
      just stop sfe you are digging yourself a further hole by continuing to try to justify your actions calling someone horseface is totally professional btw
  yeah like honestly if i just wanted to offer fair criticism id have phrased it differently the how unfair was completely out of place     not that it made sfes response any better you need to keep a polite at all times as an organization and even if its not a business the events are not possible without those who buy the tickets
  not sfe but thats what she looks like
  actually she could not get a ticket herself and did she not want one of the early entrance tickets that sold out
  she was unwilling to prove she was a lolita  i remember at under the sea they made it very clear that nonlolitas were welcome too there was even a kimomo fashion show there was one girl who tried to get in without ticket but she was a lolita
  are we seeing the same screencap its totally reasonable to complain about not getting an email but instead of saying were sorry that happened and were glad well see you there anyway and admit something went wrong theyre like you got a ticket so dont bring this up
  i thought the same the only thing i read is the how unfair part and then sfe complains k is posting repeatedly
  the person who posted about her friend being denied had a horse as her fb pic not sfe just trying to not use her name because of cgl rules       thats true i guess maybe the idea is can we verify you somehow but if you see the sfe email they mention asking about a comm and such we dont have the original email asking for info so i dunno if its lolita only i am only assuming      she got the moonlight ticket until sfe took it away please read the thread       she got the tickets so saying i couldnt get vip because i didnt get a link in time isnt true it was a what if i already have an example of how to give concrit but yes important to note k wasnt trying to suggest anything but to cause issues she should have brought it up via email not fb actually since they said any issues should go to their email repeatedly to people complaining on fb wasnt going to help her get a link
  her friend got her the ticket not herself next time read a little more carefully
well this is a bummer i forgot this existed until recently because a friend is attending but obviously i didnt preregister nor do i have any idea where i wouldve purchased them in the first place but i dont have to worry since now its a private thing still wish i couldve attended it looked like it was shaping up to be pretty cool
    doxxed on here you walnuts it got deleted pretty quick since its against the rules
    nobody is calling her horse face they called her horse girl because her fb icon is a picture of a horse  i guess its a stretch to ask this of you since youre too busy with the conspiracy theories assuming that anyone disagreeing you must be sfe but maybe you should take the time to learn to read
  warosuorg/cgl/thread/10045626  the only two deleted posts were dumb low quality bait and only cp gets permanently deleted from the archives
  warosuorg/cgl/thread/10045626  it wasnt in this thread you total moron it was weeks ago this thread doesnt predate the mentions of it now does it    keep lowkey asking for proof of the doxxing which is essentially asking for the information in the doxxing and your posts will continue to be removed because its against the rules
  sure jan
  so it was before we knew about the weird ticket system
  nobody said it was daily  im not the victim here im just trying to keep you from getting the whole thread deleted it was in a previous thread relating to german law and the nature of sfe its cute that you think the archives wont remove personal information when requested your screaming about needing proof isnt going to get you tickets to the event so youll have to be autistic at home while those of us who know how to behave enjoy the event without you
  threatening to sue someone and emailing people the n word arent valid forms of critique friend
    reread the mail anon and dont try to sell us the event as a life goal anyone with a little sense should be glad not to have to see the fake smile of the others
  the email does not say anyone was doxxed every day do you need glasses    now i feel a little bad for you though if you assume that enjoying an event with my friends is nothing but fake smiles maybe your life goal should be to reevaluate why you even participate in this fashion if youre that bitter about it
    over the past month members of our team have been doxxed threatened with legal action slandered and harassed on a near daily basis by a small but forcefull section of the online jfashion community  on a near daily basis
  in their defence maybe they meant to use an oxford comma and the clause should be harassed on a near daily basis
  calling someone you dont agree with autistic  this is how you know you spent too much time on 4channel
  so mad they start reporting everyone who disagrees with them or calls them out for lying
  even then its still a massive exaggeration
  idk what youre talking about since the post you replied to got deleted its just not normal or okay to call people autists in that manner
  how do you know are you one of the people harassing or threatening lawsuits to have such an accurate sense of the frequency it hasnt been that long since the tickets were announced and ive seen mention of several incidents on facebook and from more than one organizer
  neither is throwing around the n word and that seems to have gotten at least one post deleted from this thread    you would think mana was announced to be giving out lap dances the way people are losing their minds over this event
  sorry i forgot that were a kiddy friendly space now
  from what was posted here and in the last thread  if you saw more mentions post or explain them or else there is no use in posting here about it  i thought only one person threatened a lawsuit
there are so many things sfe could have handled better and now they are whining about that not everyone kisses and loves them for what they are doing   holding the event as a private one is semi illegal in germany it would be difficult to hold that up in court as private means you have to know everyone and not by letting them register first   that might be why they are so sensitive about negativ critisismn and threatening to sue them   but if you are that sensitive you should not be pissing off people by acting as unprofessional as they did
  haha but the way sale is going they know everyone just there friends are attending xd
i honestly think the organisers are exaggerating get sympathy point i dont suspect that each these claims happened at least once considering how many people they have pissed off at this point but i stand by my point of them heavily exaggerating for asspats or because they simply cant handle criticism    i can try to see if i can find that specific post but my friend told one of the organisers that they should have been open and/or more clear with what how and why they were going to use everyones personal information and the fact that they havent been open with it until now might just might be illegal and that they should just be more transparent next time to avoid chaos like this the organisers response was basically are you threatening to sue me     sothese girls have thinner skin than an peach
  this im surprised at how fiercely and blindly people are defending their actions if the organisers of any other event behaved like this theyd be a laughing stock
  well one of the girls in my community had a tantrum and did literally threaten to suit against the organisers there was a facebook post just because you want it to be exaggeration doesnt mean these things arent happening its not just thin skin
  i think  my point  my friend said    opinions and rumors arent facts  threats of legal action harassment and/or doxxing are not appropriate ways to complain about something you dont like and is more than just backlash the fact they havent cancelled the event outright proves its not about anyone being thin skinned lolitas are unbelievably entitled and immature you dont have to be lovelies but you also arent literal princesses i think  and  have a better sense of whats happening
  one case is still not a nearly daily basis it is still exaggeration   and if one of the girls really took legal action against the organizers they would have a really good chance under german law i really dont understand how sfe can still be defended
  the nearly daily clearly refers to the sum total of suit threats messages emails etc of which there are several examples even in this thread dont be willfully dense just to try to make your point stick this whole thing would be laughable if it werent so pitiful
  that girl k is not the one who doxxed them or threatened them she just complained about not getting the link she was supposed to get
why do you people care so much what is the point of all the complaints are all of you bitching because you didnt or wont get a ticket is being this angry about something this minor some german cultural thing that i dont understand if you hate sfe so much make your own events and do it better
  i assume youre posting to agree with me because this is my point  there are multiple examples of things that are threats messages harassment etc    if you were on fb when k was posting you would have seen the barrage of comments she made many of which got deleted people were trying to ask questions and comment about issues they were having and getting drowned out by her useless screeching
  yes of course critizing is only a german habit and we are all mad about not getting tickets any more prejudices and we already have better events which are at least legal and without this drama sorry
  there are multiple examples of things that are threats messages harassment  i havent seen any
  how fiercely and blindly people are defending their actions  its because those defenders are the organizers themselves just look at the past post and all the information that is provided without any proof of course lmao and the amount of offense the posters seem to feel its hilarious
  total of suit threats   which was only one person   messages emails etc of which there are several examples even in this thread  where theres no direct harassment in anything that was posted other than calling them unprofessional
    conveniently ignoring even things deleted from this thread but i forgot that cgl doesnt consider racism to be harassment
  i dont know how to see deleted posts
  earlier points still stands though how many times has these mentioned racist slurs happened actually and where
  getting called a nigger is hardly full blown harassment its just a stupid insult
  
        in german law once a customers had ordered an paid for something the seller cannot back out the seller has to do anything to give the customer what they have ordered if not the customer is entitled to not only a refund but also compensation so if they had any tickets left they owed her the tickets   i know this because i work in online retail and once the customer has paid were fucked fortunately not a lot of people actually know about this law
  thank you for the voice of reason they are behaving unprofessionally and fucked up but that doesnt mean the event is going to be bad or that there has to be tons of drama
  the problem with having all this mismanagement drama before the event will make people look extra carefully at the event there is no way that this mess didnt put a big dent into their reputation everything at the event that might go wrong will be juged more harshly things that would have been overlooked otherwise might now become a problem especially if they keep up their intransparency attitude
  true they could have saved it by just admitting that they had problems and simply apologizing but the way they handled it was just the worst
not sure yet if ill be able to go provided i get a ticket what do you think are the chances of me reselling it successfully if things go tits up
  i for one would definitely buy it off you if tickets sell out
  they usually make a facebook post where people looking for a secondhand ticket can comment
anyone waiting on the general sale dont waste your time all 2 day tickets are sold out
all sold out clicked it as soon as i got my link but it was too late oh well
this is taking the piss at 1901 all the tickets apart from the evening only sold out now the evening only ones are sold out too  i really wanted to go but this just seems extreme   did anyone manage to get a ticket
4 minutes and still not got my link what a disappointment
  i had it open as soon as i got the email and all 2 day tix were gone only the evening ones were free
  i got the email and 1 minute past
  i managed to select the cheaper 2 day one but couldnt go any further to checkout if you dont live in germany it doesnt look worth it to be getting the evening ones thats a lot of travelling for little payoff
im interested in going but having 180 tickets be gone just like that in just a couple of minutes sounds kinda weird even for a regular event how many of those are only eveningtickets or were sold or preordered  before anyone goes for my throat i am not hinting at foul play im just curious about the numbers
i got an evening one but im thinking about reselling it but i sort of feel like there arent that many that would want that kind of ticket i just pretty much grabbed whatever was left
  a chunk of the 180 tickets went in presale i think i would love to know how many tickets were available today
  its literally hate speech but ok
i got two 85 tickets others were already gone
  i went for the 85 ticket but got this wth
  can barely wait for the ticket drama to hit the fan one more time and watch both the community and the organizers freak out at each other again
  same here
  could it be and this is just a tinfoil that the evening ones were the most ones left after presale hence why barely anyone else got one that wasnt the dreg tickets
      the 85 tickets showed up for a minute tried to buy them but they were gone then my screen looked the same as yours
  i have a feeling that was why there was 2 releases give the best tickets to the chosen few and leave us peasants with the scrapings
not even wanting to go and im just following the whole thing for the salt but as someone who has organised many events im really pissed at the girl saying its not considerate to sell this few tickets    all the mistakes the orga has made aside what is not considerate is to complain about event sizes when people are doing this because they want to give to the community if youre not happy do your own events
  yeah leave them hold it as big or as small as they want i just wish there was one release not 2
  i agree i wouldnt have minded missing out if i had the same chance at getting them as everyone else
  sfe events always sell out quickly
  whats the difference between the activities in the evening and in the day
  if youre not happy do your own events  the absence of sfe for a year did seem to spawn a few new events so im hoping they return next year
last time i went to a sfe event some brand items already sold out to the few people that got early entrance i wonder if with evening tickets brands save some stock for the people who cant go during the day or will they try to sell as much as possible during the day
    they sell out quickly yes and that is fine as long as the playing field is level its true that not everyone had the same chance if any chance many didnt even receive the link email until they had already sold out
  only the tea party and vip tickets
  but the playing field is never truely level previous years a lot of people couldnt access the website because it was overloaded
  some of their events didnt have separate teaparty tickets
  if everyone is in the same position smashing refresh at least you have a chance if the tickets are sold out before you even have the link its impossible
  yeah my link came through at 1902 so by the time i clicked into it everything was gone i suppose ill just wait to see if i can get a resold ticket i can understand wanting to thank last attendees and donators but it seems like the remaining number of tickets for the general sale was really small not trying to tinfoil tho
    they send the link to everyone at the exact same time if you didnt get it on time you had slower connection than the rest
  my ticket link came through at 1910 and everything was long sold out     like other anon not trying to tinfoil but as annoying as that kchan girl was and how messy her whole complaint was sfe didnt bother addressing the fact that people didnt receive emails or received them late they sort of threw their hands up and went we did something with mailchimp so it should be okay now but obviously didnt do anything decent to make sure people would actually get a fair chance to get tickets in the general sale
  i still dont understand why they dont send out the link at 7pm but activate the side/ the shop around one hour later that would would make sure that everyone had the link befor it starts
  yeah thats a possibility it could have been a good idea to send out the password with yesterdays email and had the website just go live at 1900 not trying to sound bitter its just how i would have handled it but its easier to nitpick when youre not the one handling stuff like this
  that is valid but they have done this multiple times now and manage to fuck it up every year its frustrating that they never learn and there is always issues with the sale
  if you want to look at it like that so is calling someone a dumb cunt still not full blown harassment
  i dont think thats how it works theres nothing wrong with my broadband and my email arrived five minutes late
  its a matter of the servers of both mailchimp and your email provider  external connections if you use a client such as outlook so your connection is somewhat relevant but not responsible for emails arriving late thats more a matter of mailchimp which is not really designed for purposes such as thisas someone said above they should have sent the email with the link and open the sale an hour later
  they wont part of the vip is to get early entrance to shop       to be fair usually people put into their cart and let it expire so you could have had a chance this time it seems that most completed it so it was hard i have gotten vip from events by waiting 1520 for the expiring cart stuff but i think ppl will resell
i have been reading this topic and noticed some of you bought tickets in the hope to resell this how are you planning to do this with the new rules on reselling tickets
  what new rules
  it would have been nice to announce beforehand that this event is going to be smaller though the way they tried to get people excited for the event actually rather made it seem as if it was going to be bigger than the previous ones
  they claimed in a mail that they had plans to make it bigger but changed their minds because people were meanypoos uwu
  its not new you cant resell for more       its also really not confirmed how small or big it was just that they arent planning on trying to figure out more spaces
  and it was never announced publicly that it was being made smaller       months of random tourist trivia did make me think that sfe was leading up for something /
  is this how racists think
  same anon now looking for other euro events to go to instead
  keep throwing more buzzwords or better just straight up leave if youre retarded enough to take everything on 4chan serious
  me as well but i dont know which guest i would consider worth going for a high price maybe iw
  racist  buzzword  nayrt but youre fucking retarded
  there is more to it than not being allowed to sell it for more you also cant sell it yourself      you cant resell your ticket to someone else you have to sell it back to sfe and they will sell it to the first person on the waiting list this was to prevent unregistered people from buying tickets/entering
  to correct myself you have to contact them and they will ask the people on the waiting list for you and if someone says yes it will be sold to that person and if there is no one that wants to buy it you are at loss from what i understood you cant really sell it yourself because of the whole you have to be registered and we have to know who is coming rule this was in the email about the ticket sales
  nayrt but it kinda makes sense from the safety standpoint theyve been trying to push but its also kindaconvoluted   what happens if someone forgets about that part of the mail or simply just skimmed through it and thus didnt really pick up on that information and tries to sell it by regular means
  the safety standpoint thing is bullshit events routinely refuse entry to creeps without having a ridiculous ticket system it was just so they could make it a private party
can we talk about they now tell german lolitas they can still get a 85 ticket if they volunteer to help on sunday
  lol caps cant find it on the group
they posted it in a private group of a german lolita community
does anyone know which organisers from previous sfe events are still organisers now
  k and a are still on board but not idea if choke or the french girls are there i think thats it
      lol thats bs why isnt that open to anyone
  choke wasnt an organiser
  they probably want to meet you beforehand and maybe they only want german speakers
  which group exactly
  thats literally not how email works anon the time the email hits your mail server has nothing to do with how fast or slow your own connection is    this sounds like a shitfest im so glad i have nowhere enough energy or spare cash to throw at events in western europe
  whatever the point is that they sent it to everyone at the same time
  i think you are mixing things up choke was involved with am and the hamburg event a few years ago she has nothing to do with sfe
  so only 2 people why didnt they just start a new group instead of using the sfe name for a completely different type of event and less than half of the usual organisers they even dont use the sfe website anymore
you gulls are sitting here still debating this meanwhile most people that didnt get a ticket are already jumping ship and joining other european events and maybe this should just be the normal reaction support smaller events so that we dont have to lick sfes ass every time
  a absolutely should not be involved shes the one who has been bitching and whining the most and doing really unprofessional posts either as sfe or from her own account
  i agree im so glad other events have started to blossom around the continent
  myths was an amazing event hoping for more events of that size and atmosphere to pop up around europe
    make your own threads about them then instead of going into the one dedicated to this one event and whine
  what other european events are there planned for next year i genuinely want to know cause i loved myths also 
  american who attended eternal twilight this year i really enjoyed it
  the point is they knowingly used an unreliable system instead of sending the mail with the shop link earlier and let the shop go live at the given time
what were your most embarrassing cosplay or lolita moments    i fell down the stairs running away from a furry
  what did the furry do
  what did the furry ever do to you
i was at my first meet and wearing platforms and ended up eating major shit with a pie in my hand luckily nothing got ripped or destroyed even the pie but i did it in front of my whole comm and i scuffed my platforms pretty bad
my friend was at con when her tights from wish exploded in the rear everyone started dabbing on her thonged butt until finally a kind jojo came and covered her ass with a sword art online wall scroll
lol my first ever car accident i was coming home from a con and i didnt check my blindspot was still a newbie driver and accidentally bumped the car in the next lane     i was still in lolita so i panicked and ripped off my wig so i could look more normal and not like a complete crazy unfortunately my dress was bright and colorful since i was a sweet lolita and one of the people from the other car audibly gasped thankfully it was a minor scratch and no police were called    i offered no explanation as to why i was dressed like that nor did they ask but im glad i can forget about it
  good grief man
  its wild that they didnt even call the police must have assumed you were mental or something
  most embarrassing part of that whole story is that you own an sao wall scroll
  nayrt  you dont call the police unless the damage exceeds 500 or there is an injury at least in ny this is the case
  no i dont
  are you illiterate anon
  being invited to dance by a 2b far out of my league
  that mentality  not gonna make it
  i was a shy cute 9s who was much shorter than her i couldnt fucking keep my cool dancing with her
  was it a nice booty at least
secondhand embarrassment but  be me and friend near decade ago babbys first con  participate in cosplay contest because shiny and had a decent skit  dont get an award but we had cardboard props so i wasnt expecting much  friend is saltine cracker/10  deadpoolbro before deadpool was normie fotm for 4 years because of the movie is chatting us up as awards are announced  friend grumbles oh the only reason those landwhales won is because theyre friends with the judges  deadpoolbro just like turns sideways and goes one of those landwhales is my wife  just stare at friend and slowly shuffle away  deadpoolbro turns out to be con security    drifted apart from that friend and he left college and got married early and is now miserable while i see deadpoolbro every year at a handful of cons in the same area nice guy friend not so much you live and learn
  to be fair furries are creepy
  thats pretty cute anon  shouldve danced with her then let her mommydom you while she bullies your dick
    exist
  at my first con i was about 15 i was hyped the fuck up because i was so happy to have made friends that had the same interested and sense of humor as i did that when someone in the group said we should totally go to the main floor and sing the pokemon opening it sounded like a really good idea at the time i think we made it past the first couple lines before all imploding from embarrassment    she was probably making fun of you then
  holy crap my neighbour hanged himself this summer     my most embarrasing moment was dropping my butter beer on my velvet skirt also the strong smell that never faded
  betraying your friend at first sign of trouble  regardless of whether or not one of them was his wife a landwhale is a landwhale anon
turned at a corner at the convention too fast and ran into a life sized cod advert soldier cardboard cutout i jumped back and knocked a real cod cosplayer to the floor the panel staff started laughing and telling each other to go pick the props up off the floor  there were just sooo many identical soldiers walking around the center as advertisment for the games i always felt watched and judged
brought granny to con and she said the n word
  that happened    to contribute to this thread i fell into an elevator in front of another lolita during fanime this year i locked eyes with her as i was falling down and she had this look of complete shock the security guard told me to watch my step as i was falling down which was hilarious at least the lolita complimented my coordinate so i wasnt as embarrassed as i could have been
  based grandma
i got mistaken for a sex worker thrice when i decided to do a stupid demon dressup for the rave event once by an officer twice by civilians
  you mean you arent
  only in highschool and for two thousand dollars for an evening dressed as lunamaria its hard to pass up
middle school  new to this school dont know people well yet but theres a cute boy in one of the classes  halloween so everyone gets to wear costumes for school  nicejpg  was around 2009 i was really into haruhi so cosplayed her  everyone looks up to me and people show off their own costumes to me i compliment them  decide to dance hare hare yukai in front of the class before a lesson begins  wanted to teach it to others as well a few people volunteer to come and learn the dance with me  the cute boy volunteers as well  start teaching the first few moves  decide it would be a fun prank to pull the cute boys pants down as we dance  do it  everyone screams the whole class is at disarray  some kid runs and tells the principal  i get called to the principals office  i get fired from my job as a substitute teacher for groping a student
some autistic ass cunt was hitting on my bf at a con so bad i was cosplaying from the same video game series he was but it was like a minor cute character so i could go along with and support him she begins talking to us and asks me about what games ive played i explain to her that im not interested in the games at the moment but i wanted to do something fun with my bf and go along with him idk why but that infuriated her    cunt decides to follow us into a panel about the game my boyfriend left me to see his friends i sat down and started playing my ds minding my business and this bitch proceeds to sit next to me and starts harrassing me mansplaining the character i was cosplaying to me and calling me a fake fan i got really mad told her to fuck off and left the panel what made it really agonizing was that there was other people sitting around us just looking uncomfortable af and not saying anything    needless to say boyfriend joined me up and felt like shit about not being there and thats essentially why i definitely will never get into any final fantasy games because holy shit no thanks
  wait you were a teacher there and pulled a students pants  what the fucking hell girl of course youd get fired for that what were you thinking  also pulling pants is never funny its something little kids or infantile people do jeez
  running around in hnk cosplay costume on halloween   freeze my balls off   get catcalled and strangers ask if i do escort work   im a guy
  the end is a copy pasta yo
one cosplay included this really loose draped shirt it was last day of the con and i decided to go braless since no one would notice well afterwards i looked at some pictures and realized it was really noticable basically i showed my nipples to everyone thank god the character were really obscure and only few people took my picture    so remember kids to wear your bra or other undergarment
  i can feel your righteous fury anon of all the things i wish i would be able to say and do in your shoes
wearing a hnk cosplay white winter uniform  got a random boner on the con floor
  post pics
  anon are you saying that you want to see my gemitals
  im saying i want to get my rocks off
  ya ive been embarrassed before but that was nextlevel im still gonna cosplay but fuck some fandoms out there need to see how theyre being represented and why people think theyre full of elitist assholes
  pasties  better than bras they dont accidentally ride up or show anything
  they never will thats why you need to steel yourself against those types and stand your ground its not their duty to determine who is allowed in the fandom you have a place there just as anyone or honestly just ignore them to people who want attention like that its the worst punishment you can serve
  this but they hurt my tiddy comin off i wont stop using them because of that but still
  free the nips  bras are tit torture chambers
  u right anon thanks for that
tripped in my rhs in front of some normies who had just asked me how well i could walk in them and i said they were very easy to walk in
    wtf kinda pasties are you using mine come off super easily
  either youre used to it or i have sensitive nips
  oh shit you reminded me of when i wore a pastel goth outfit to school and i tripped on my own swankiss platforms tore up my knee and my wig almost came off nearly kms lmao
ankle randomly gave way in heels and fell into a bush in disneyland just as tiana and her group of dancing people came toward the little platform i fell into the bushes right beside the platform i thank mana every day for blessing me with bloomers
  i think the most embarrassing part of that story is the fact you were wearing pastel goth
  youre not supposed to put the adhesive part right over your nips theres a nonstick little pad over the nips and adhesive on the rest of the tiddy     its still not super pleasant but its no worse than ripping off a bandaid use baby oil if it hurts to remove the bonus is moisturized tiddies
  embarrassing lolita moments  lolitas are embarassing so the first word is redundant
i was waiting in a very long registration line for a con about an hour into it the girl behind me told me my skirt had been unzipped the whole time im glad she told me but she could have said something a bit sooner
  get married too early  be miserable because you jumped into adulthood without experience and dont know wtf you are doing    get married too late  be miserable because you always feel like you lost out on younger more pure love and always wonder what was and could have been    dont get married  be miserable because dating in your 30s sucks due to large amounts of incel creepers on the male side and whiny single mothers looking for a meal ticket to help her raise tyrones bastard on the female side      why is love suffering no matter what you fucking do
  you dont stunt your emotional development once you enter a relationship or marriage anon your partner is supposed to be one of your best friends they help you grow and grow with you     feel like you lost out on younger more pure love  mature love has its benefits as well there are some things that can be felt more deeply and earnestly at a more mature age such as being emotionally open with another human being enough to share your fears and insecurities    i cant speak to the older dating scene but theres absolutely people out there who dont want to get married too you just gotta weed through the rejects to find them    love will come to you when the time is right
  poverty drives individuals to do wicked things
be 12  first con ever  cosplaying wrath from fma literal trash costume  my friends did walkons so i was like yea ill do it too   get over excited at supportive congoers while on stage  proceed to run off stage after my time  proceed to trip over rail weight that was holding down the curtain  bashed my face off the floor and con staff had to clean up the aftermath of my bloody nose
  dabbing on her thonged butt is an iconic collection of words
  the traps you described apply to immature people dumb people or people who tricked themselves into thinking theyre not asexual or aromantic
last year at awa in the hotel room i complimented my friends little sister on her ryuko cosplay he thought i was perving on her and told me to lay off made me feel like a creep i tried to prove that she didnt arouse me by showing them both my flaccid penis but they refused to listen to reason
  i tried to prove that she didnt arouse me by showing them both my flaccid penis but they refused to listen to reason  what the fuck
  her tights from wish exploded in the rear  must have been a terrible fart
  this wasnt embarrassing for me personally but it was really funny    at work talking to coworkers   favorite coworker also likes lolita   while talking about it another co worker asks is there a lolita style for guys   before i can answer the new guy who started that day interrupts and says   isnt that called shota   i say no and that shota is usually a fetish thing  he pulls me aside later saying thanks for warning me about that shota thing i had no idea     sure bro good cover

  there ways to tactfully harpoon landwhales and shit talking one to her husband is not it      if you always think about what could have been instead of what you currently have its going to hurt no matter what you need to change what youre focusing on
  your fault for wearing brand new shoes in a place youve never been brand new shoes take time to break in regardless if youre walking somewhere familiar or not

consider myself an almost daily lolita wearing taobao for daily errands because comfy  wearing classic/sweet toned down print nothing ott  donating blood because im healthy and it doesnt take much out of my day  lady collecting blood comments on my style  i really like your dress do you wear these types of clothes all the time  explain its what i like to wear where practical  you know i saw a documentary on the internet about the people that wear the type of clothes youre wearing  completely lose my spaghetti desperately trying to explain im not a living doll and that the community is in no way associated to any of the perceived sexualisation      oh i think it was a documentary on one of the designers i just thought the details on the dresses were really pretty  awkward silence across the room where others are still donating blood  waiting desperately to finish my blood donation so i can leave and never return to that clinic again
  how did it turn out i wouldnt be surprised if i actually came up with some excuse to get the fuck outta there if that were me
  canada gta why is there a gem prostitution ring i dont know about
  from the beer or from the neighbor
  goddamnit why didnt i go to this school raaaahhh im still a virgin fuckkk why didnt the teachers touch me aaarrrrgghghhh
  oh no maybe next time you should wait until the other person brings it up before you vehemently deny it this is also why its generally better to just not bring up nabokov/the unfortunate connotations of the name lolita unless the person youre talking to does because otherwise youre placing the association in the persons mind when it wasnt there before
  ayrt thats dark i like it    this convo made my day
oldie but a goodie    dc over a decade ago cant remember what year  like 3 in the goddamn morning  me and my buddy are slightly buzzed and wearing mid00s ott sweet complete with matching wigs you remember that trend  weve both reached that state of sleepdeprived where your brain is working about five steps behind everything youre doing  walking around looking for wifi so we can hook our dses up to do some global trading in pokemon   im not looking where im going  smack right into someone  i bounce off this brick shithouse of a dude and fall ass over teakettle on the ground  i look up  and up  ive just run into a super jacked 64 black dude  oh god this is gonna get weird quick  all of a sudden he leans down and basically picks me up and puts me back on my feet  oh my god are you ok i didnt see you there you guys look amazing i didnt ruin your dress did i what is all this you guys have on this is really cool  explaining lolita to a dude literally a foot taller than me whose arms are bigger around than both of mine together  meanwhile friend is just staring in that my brain cant comprehend what im seeing way  he thanks me for the explanation and heads towards the hotel elevators  i turn to friend  that was weird  shes silent then  no that was christopher judge    and thats how i explained lolita to tealc
    it took me too long to realize hnk didnt refer to hokuto no ken in this case

small local con  in audience of cosplay contest  walkon category  artist from aas 12yearoldish sister enters walkon category wearing kawaii facemask and pikachu hoodie as her own original character  watch her skip gleefully up the stairs onto the stage on top of the world  remember what its like to be that young and carefree  watch as girl gallops across the stage on cloud nine  girl completely misses steps going off the stage  body keeps going   flips up at 180degreeangle  lands squarely on back  audience gasps and sits in silence  shift uncomfortably as secondhand embarrassment of poor young girls shining moment comes crashing down dragging all our hopes and dreams down with it  mc rushes over to check on her  girl painstakingly gets up and shuffles away  mc shes okay walk it off yeah  crowd claps for girl  two girls in front of me burst into laughter  try so hard to hold it in but the schadenfreude is too much    god bless that girl weve all had that moment thats going so right suddenly go so wrong
  i was too shy to dance she gave me her number though i havent spoken with her yet
  well thats going pretty well im routing for you anon
  i tried to prove that she didnt arouse me by showing them both my flaccid penis but they refused to listen to reason
  she gave me her number though i havent spoken with her yet  if you didnt text her when she gave it to you its probably someone elses
mine was at a local con about a year ago there were people who go to cons and interview cosplayers asking them questions for youtube videos and the girl who was doing the interviews came up to me and asked me the question for the video instead of giving a regular answer i tried to be funny and make a joke surrounding the character i was cosplaying but i botched it so fucking hard that i ended up just making myself look like a complete retard i genuinely cant look at that part of the video without being overwhelmingly embarrassed and ive made sure never to tell anyone i know about it because of how autistic i made myself look
  give us a taste of what you said anon
  awww bless
  oh this reminds me of some good shit    a national tv channel was recording a series about people who didnt had sex yet   some 30y/o ugly guy signs up   takes crew to local anime convention  he has a friend of mine show him around and introduce him to different girls  actually needed to talk to her as she brought some stuff i bought from her  at this point i found her in the busy loud karaoke room i couldnt hear anyone further than 1m away due to the noise    go talk to her unaware the camera crew is there at the other side of the room  she starts to introduce me to this guy  i dont even hear what he is saying and she doesnt notice  akward reactionsjpg  a month later i get bombarded by messages of old friends from school and people at the shop i worked at started talking to me about seeing me on television in a show about people trying to get laid i just then heard what they were saying and its still quite embarrassing    and i was in that show for around 3sec or so there was another cosplayer ohh i wonder how she is doing now she got bullied by everyone even radiohosts started using little bits of things she said on that show
  how shallow not that i expect more from /cgl/
had a bladder infection and pissed myself only two people were around thankfully
  funny how so many people at cons running around in anime costumes they bought from china and party city capeshit hate fursuiters who have more talent in craftmanship than theyll ever have
  pls try harder next time
  gottem
  please dont take the things you read on this board to heart good grief
walked around the con for hours before i realized my buttcrack was out
i watch my friend put on her shitty sailor moon cosplay and take pictures with her god bless your poor soul jennifer
my friend helped me dye my hair dark blue for a cosplay a week before a con i was going to  hair faded to pink by the time the con rolled around
i once went to a con by myself because everyone else i knew fucked off to a meet my friend was holding that i didnt get invited too and the con was halloween themed  my friend is the mc and the guy whos doing most the events and lets me be a judge for the talent contest because he couldnt give a fuck about some 15 year olds singing vocaloid songs on halloween halfway through some girl comes up as kaneki from tokyo ghoul and says shes gonna sing the op from it i thought i said under my breath god tokyo ghoul is shit what i did say was a vey audible god tokyo ghoul is shit and everyone in the hall heard me and then i had a bunch of angry 1317 year olds trying to get to explain why i hate tokyo ghoul and if i hate fun this all came to a harley quinn cosplayer who looked no more than 16 in her fucking corset bra and hotpants trying to stab me with her fake knife and kick me in the balls because i hated her fave anime   i wasnt embarresed but i sure was made a fool out of that day
  harley quinn  no more than 16  corset bra and hotpants
  blue to pink  what the fuck 
  canadians being impolite  sounds fake to me    but if you were downtown people probably wouldnt blink an eye considering the cons at the mtcc
  plausibel
  this is what happens when you spend too much time discussing anime on 4chan
  based pure poster
  its funny you say that because i never thought of it that way    i still hate furries but at least theyre better than the career instathots that buy all their shit and make nothing
  big oof

guys i just bought this total rip off replica on wish for 15 am i the worst
  haenulis a piece of work herself so fuck it i guess
  this is just stolen stock photos enjoy your awkwardly constructed chinesium it wasnt even a good design to start with this is gonna be hilarious
  link
  as with most stuff on chinese sites yeah it probably wont look anything near the photos  post when you receive anon curious how it will be
    op should make one of those expectation vs reality collages when it arrives
  well it is going to look hella trashy when it arrivesno one deserves to look like hot garbage but i guess you were kinda asking for it when you knowingly bought a 15 replica
  the construction is so plain its prolly the same fucking thing anon cant cost her more than that to make surely
i bet those 15 bucks that anon is baiting because haenuli posted this again    too bad no one on cgl gives enough of a fuck about her for it to be a successful bait
  why does cgl hate haenuli so much
  i wonder this too ive seen some of her dresses irl and theyve always seemed quite nice especially on tall girls
  cgl hates any print/brand that fatties can fit
  also curious about the quality  pls post when it arrives
  shes a little self righteous she threw a huge fit over someone getting a tattoo of one of the skeletons claiming it was art theft and everyone is required to get her explicit permission to get a tattoo    plus honestly her prints look shit theyre super busy and cheap looking just look at the crystal moon whatever shit she barfed out her sizes are plus size friendly but also way too big a large fits like a xxl and so on lots of people end up selling their items because theyre just too big
  look back at the archives she was selling some aliexpress accessories and claiming they were handmade and then getting mad about copying her design when she was the one reselling
  iirc it was a replica of a french brands accessory too she was planning on reselling a cheap chinese replica and claiming that she assembled and painted it herself even though all ae listings showed it as preassembled and prepainted then she feigned ignorance when people pointed this out and iirc deleted posts/comments it left a really bad taste in my mouth
  i want to know why cgl hates royal princess alice
  youre skewing it she found the bits wholesale at a street market vendors table saw the pieces next to each other and obviously they looked great as a possible set little did she know they were bits from an aliexpress knock off of the french brand    so she did buy a bunch and assemble a test to share online as a possible future accessory and then a bunch of people came to her with more info    i think shes been learning a lot trial and error about going from small indie to larger and very wellknown korean brand the stuff with the elpress bonnets was a rookie mistake too    if she had a larger operation with a team to do legal and research she wouldnt have to find this out as she went along give her a break dude i dont think shes malicious      the tattoo was personal art about how someone close to her commit suicidei think shes entitled to be upset if people got it without asking her permission its her art
  yeah but its a tattoo if she didnt find out about it she wouldnt even be upset
  im not skewing anything i just dont believe that story of her separately buying and then coincidentally painting and assembling the pieces the exact same way as the ones sold online ill believe that she didnt know it was a replica and i dont think she was being malicious just lazy and somewhat deceitful even if she did have to assemble them herself doubtjpg the pieces were always meant as a little red riding hood  grandma in the wolfs belly set she was saying she created the accessory which implies creative input when at best she assembled them as intended you might as well try to sell paintbynumber paintings as original works either way its tacky if not outright shady
  she has a point about the tattoo though you cant just go getting an artists work tattooed on your body without their permission/knowledge/payment that literally is art theft theres a reason people pay people to design tattoos for them
  iirc the person asked her and she said she didnt feel comfortable with it but they did it anyway and posted it
so this thread is not a waste can some actually buy the awful replica and review it here
  its legal because youre not selling the artwork or making profit from it its like if i printed out a picture of her artwork and got it framed myself yes i paid for the materials frame paper printer ink etc but the company is making money off the materials and their time not from creating a piece of artwork now if i went and sold it that entirely different     the only time she could sue is if she registered a copyright and could prove that the tattoo was maliciously harming her brand value or sales     pretty sure she was overreacting
  its a taobao brand parading as a japanese brand and at brand prices its a symbol of what lolita should not become
  hi nunu nice engrish
tbh the person shouldnt have gotten the tattoo without her permission  ive got a tattoo from a fan artist too and got their express permission beforehand for this it might be in a gray zone regarding art theft but it sure as hell is simple courtesy to ask the artist who created it first
  she was caught selling accessories as her own workwhen they were clearly bought off aliexpress  yeashe really has no room to talk about art theft
  but isnt the tattoo artist profiting from it i see where youre coming from but it still feels like taking advantage of someones else work without their permission
  legal doesnt make it okay though plenty of things are legal but still shitty to do at best its still tacky
  this is the dumbest shit ive ever heard
  its not the same thing at all meta have also resold accessories available wholesale thats different to ripping off an entire art print
  still different though meta resold accessories available wholesale but never claimed that they made the accessories or that theyre meta exclusive   haenuli on the other hand did and then tried to backpedal her way out of it once she was called out
  nayrt but only if the tattoo artist offered it as flash otherwise when you get a tattoo you are paying for their skills time and materials interesting how people brag about their mmm chandelier or usakumya or ap logo or disney character tattoos without being accused of committing fraud
  youve posted in 4 different threads and /cgl/ still took the bait    this board is full of retards
  i think her prints can be nice in concept but the dress construction is always a let down and is lacklustre the material seems cheap from what ive seen irl crystal guardians and that skeleton one so far and there just always seems to be something lacking about the design i dont know if its not enough lace or additional details/frills but the designs just seem plain and flat theyre just not very exciting to look at for me personally
  yea haenuli is such a snob she tried to say it was her design until she got caught really pathetic btw she totally tried to play it off all innocent caught red handed
   but like why would you want a tattoo that an artist explicitly said they didnt want people to get wheres the joy of having that on your body i just think it makes it a little meaningless
  so are we letting yumi fujiwara off scot free for selling 5 reproduction brooches for 100 or are japanese brands allowed to do shitty things
  is it so hard for people to crasp its different to claim you made the whole thing vs reselling accessories made from whole sale parts fujiwara was also open where she got the brooches and its up to you wheter you want to pay for it knowing the background of the product not to mention over pricing is a totally different from basically liying about making the whole accessory
  typical cgl reply kimura u isnt chinese you fucking mong
  this people get cartoon character tats all the time and no one is calling those people art thieves
  its made in china and it is taobao quality god you fucking dumbass do you think because kimura us japanese hands touched something her whole brand was magically made in japan
  but its not sold on taobao thats like saying etsy tights sellers are taobao tights because theyre made in china if its taobao quality thats one thing but saying its a taobao brand is retarded
  its made in china    so are all other brands
  fuck off theyve been around a while and they have their own style i love rpa you can go choke
    literally everything is made in china or bangledash or the phillipines you weaboo retard
    have to admit i chuckled when this thread was next to the tat thread
  yeah literally every single artist ive ever seen talk about people getting their art tatted has said they want people to ask them first/at least let them know they plan to every single one
    no they arent god is this the state of cgl they think everything brand is made in china and bangladesh
  rpa is angelic pretty for retards its all about the prints for people like you they have shitty taobao quality and youre dumb enough to pay brand prices for it all
  no they know that some of it is also manufactured in indonesia
  i didnt say it was on taobao do you have reading comprehension i said it was taobao quality and it is youre the fucking retarded one but i dont expect anything out of rpa defenders
  dont forget vietnam
  yup exactly what i thought youre a fucking elitist and think solids are best youre bland and predictable
            everyone also seems to forget her angel of music print is also traced from the lesser known poto sequel love never dies
  thats not traced there are several differences youre reaching
  jesus you type replies like how trump tweets learn to make a cohesive reply instead of typing like youre having an aneurysm
  oh god anon i read over their reply in trumps voice and it does sound like something hed tweet
  anon flipping erik horizontal and then tracing over it does not mean its not traced
  naryt but you did say a taobao brand parading as a japanese brand i know what you meant but that still doesnt change the fact that from the way you typed implied someone could go search up rpa on taobao and find it and it just being a lie about being a japanese brand
  reaching
  i agree with you that her prints look like shit but its pretty common for artists to want permission before having their original work i know original is not always the case with haenuli before another potentially shitty artist slaps it onto someone elses skin many artists are fine with it its just polite to ask the original artist first
  you type like how trump tweets  you say that like its a bad thing i personally welcome our antichyna lolita trump
  hes anti japan too you fucking idiot
  o shiitttttt  thats totally traced    someone put this on her facebook
  i bought something form rpa recently not worth it  and was way to expensive
  if were going by your quality standards meta is taobao tier and so is half of aps prints
  what piece did you buy
  how is meta even close to taobao tier have you ever had any of their pieces sure some of my older things arent amazingly up to par but everything i have bought in the past decade has been such great quality most of the time its even better constructed than equal priced baby
  they clearly dont know what their talking about
  i have a friend who has nothing but meta in her closet cause shes over 6 ft and just a very large person all over not fat but just bigger all over ive looked through her closet before and all her pieces were really nice
  what the fuck does the size of you friend have to do with this conversation i read to the end fully expecting your 6ft friend to have some further meaning to this discussion but instead you betray me like this
  cause meta is the real big girl brand
  did meta post about the resold accessories saying look at these things we made by hand
  anyone have a screen shot of this liar id love to see how this went down kek
  meta  taobao tier  i guess taobao has really lost all meaning as a descriptor of quality
  and myanmar too
    still not traced  its extremly close to the reference but not traced the lines dont match up in too many places
  its bad quality for the price
  im an experienced digital artist this is traced  it may have some changes here and there likely due to pulling and tugging some areas into a different position in an art program but these changes are small enough that the original image is still clearly defined within the reproduction   in the art world this is enough of a close match to call it a trace not a referenced image
  no hes not you idiot i dont really expect anything from someone who thinks orange man bad
  honestly is this really a big deal or is this thread just antihaenuli shes made some mistakes for sure but metamorphose has been guilty of tracing bad clipart pictures for prints and theres brands like atpi that exclusively use badly photoshopped clipart for their questionable prints    at least in comparison to those she made this into something that looks nice we have proof she can draw so it is strange i think she just wanted to make it look as close to those particular actors as possible because honestly a lot of casual fans fell in love with the movie
  it becomes a big deal when she begins to whine because some dude gets a tattoo of one of her drawings  did she get permission to trace that picture and make profit of it if not then she is a bigass hypocrite
  look what we made guys xd
  seagull calls her out
  such a coincidence guys xddd we just assembled it randomly never saw the other ones before xdddd
  g guys we found the original design dont buy from those korean art thiefs 
  damage control guyz
  are you stupid you add some lines here and there done
  wtf so she said these she assembled herselfand came up with the design   no matter what you pathetic gulls sayshe was caught and is a liar plain as day typed out kek
  if its that easy then draw it yourself and see how that turns out
  sorry i dont feel like copying some artwork to sell lolita dresses with it
  orange man bad  i never said that but it sure did get more expensive to buy from there didnt it
  here you go anon put this on a dress you sound like the type whod wear this
  wow i wanted to argue and say thats not the reason but i literally cant think of a print or brand that fatties cant fit being hated the way they are interesting
  are you retarded this is a serious question     because pretty much all brands are made not in glorious nippon get over it
  also a digital artist im just not so sure
  im talking about tattoo translation
  yeah she lied and then backpedalled when called out ceramic handmade store my ass i want to give her the benefit of the doubt but she fucked this up by blatantly lying about it she shouldve just admitted she bought the whole thing instead of pretending she had any part in making it
  yeah maxicimam seems to get good reviews from cgl
iso 12800 subedition    dump sakuracon 2018 photos here manarelated preferred but all welcome critique discuss remember the good times share the postcon blues and loneliness with anons who for those couple days or only few hours were a little less anonymous    previously on /sc18g/ 
reposting  
  those undertale parents were super sweet  thanks for sharing
  mana looks so beautiful from a distance and in pictures did he get prettier  i swear to god he looked all wrinkly and old at the signing in 2012 or whatever
  ass pic  fuck ye  cosplayer from a meme game  nope
  his makeup showed up close and i honestly found him a little patchy/powdery but i think he knows how to pose for photos/selfies cause literally all the selfies and photos of him from the event turned out amazing
  potato quality of this pic makes me wonder what if its not mana himself but a body double because stupid gaijins wont realize that its not him under the makeup  sage for newfag whos never seen mana in real life
  he didnt really look bad in person though thick and heavy makeup yeah but i was expecting way more wrinkles on his face he had a few but it was still less than i expected he definitely looked pretty good for his age     it was obviously the real mana but interesting theory no one can exude the same air that mana does
    how old is he anyways when i saw him up close i wanted to say nearing 50 but also that white makeup is very unforgiving so i dont know
  mana is roughly fifty no one but mana knows his exact age though    im half his age and wish my selfie game was as good as his no lie
  i would assume around his 50s
  hah im glad you like it it made me kek a bit  no one can exude the same air that mana does  thats good to know im more excited to go to hellocon now im only going for day 1 but hopefully ill be able to get a whiff of manas special air from afar
so who wants to split a room next year im tired of paying two months rent to sleep 40 miles from my own bed for a weekend
obligatory
  yoko daki cover  damn
  either you have the cheapest rent in the puget sound area or youre paying full price at the four seasons    but im not a big fan of sharing a room with random people as i had an unpleasant experience in the past found two people on the sakuracon forums way back in the day one was fine the other had bo issues     these days ive noticed men looking for a room to camp in tend to be creepy types with hygiene issues and as a man id feel like a weird creep myself rooming with random women at my age
  either you have the cheapest rent in the puget sound area or youre paying full price at the four seasons  i have two roommates my cut is about 500/mo including utilities my hotel bill with the discount was 830 for a single room and three nights parking  i understand your and everyone elses reservations towards rooming with a complete stranger the horror stories speak for themselves all i can say is i really only use the room to shower and sleep and youll barely know im even there i dont really care who i room with so long as they dont touch my shit and dont keep me up past 3am
    i take long showers because im actually masturbating in there but i aim my cum for the drain most of the time
  thanks for sharing
  that was definitely worth knowing ill be sure not to room with you
see all the couple cosplayers  deletes all of them  tfw no gf
thinking of pulling out my stars chris redfeild cosplay for next year
kerastylejp/category/all/international    is this where to look for photos from the tea party there was that girl there who said she was from kera and took model releases from people willing to pose and then took their pics with a phone kek but i havent seen any of those crop up anywhere yet i didnt even realise kera stopped coming out in print desu
  i honestly have no idea where to look for tea party pictures i am thinking the photographer at the tea was working with fake star       though i am not holding out hope they are going to post them
  and heres the second half  
  any pics from sunday
  id umu that nero
  nah i usually skip sunday since it always falls on easter
  also interested i had my photo taken for kera two seperate times once while wandering the con second at the tea party i cant recal but i believed both times were by different girls
  i remembered that i took a picture of the model release before handing it back to her and well looking up her name with or without kera turns up jack that kera page linked above posted a bunch of international stories from meets and tea parties that happened after sakura already starting to think we got bamboozled
  im glad to see somebody posting those thunderbolt fantasys i didnt get a chance to get their photos
  thunderbolt fantasy cosplayers are always topnotch

i was really hyped to see a triple h cosplay
  i hate how the penguins are covering most of their outfit because they look well made
  they were one of the girls had a slight malfunction with her bow so i got a closer look at just how much work they put in as the other two helped her fix it the dedication alone required to get all of that together must have been pretty amazing unfortunately i didnt get more than one photo i try to not waste the time of the people i photograph too much and i only had my phone with me anyway
goddamn how yall got a part 4 and 5 of this shit let alone a part 6
tfw no big cons until sakura   cant wait
  15 were ok 6 is super long because one person keeps bumping it
  yoko taro  the only good nier cosplay    looks like fun op sad i missed it this year
  weve got unfinished business with our man mana
prereg has started for next year
this ahris orb of illusion was super cool it sparkled and i think it glowed faintly sorry if she has already been posted
  useless without guest list
  if youve been going to sakura for a long time you know they wont announce guests until february at best lol
  oh but i know that same for practically every other con still useless if for you the main value for money is in guests and events
  tfw no friends to do pop team epic cosplay  it hurts to live
  i can almost sympathize i have weeb friends but they dont cosplay
when was the last time we had any new malice mizer merch
let it die already
how is this thread still up  tfw no gf
    
  youve heard of the washington state convention center we all have the legend the curses some foolishness about it lying in the middle of a city of rain a city of weebs buried beneath a poppink cloud a bright shining monument luring panty chasers to their doom an illusion that you can begin again change your fortunes finding it though thats not the hard part its letting go
there is a cosplayer that tenleid was talking about that is 16 years old anyone know who it is
tfw couldnt go to dsvi      no sorry
  my journey to find a cosplay gf shall never end not with the hope and strength that courses though my veins i am the weeb that shall surpass all my predecessors and bring them honor as i will be the one that shall find a cosplay gf next year please leave your discord below if interested
  mana says you will have your day
  kumoricon is next month  go bump their thread and let this fucking die already
  frens  the discord we used during the con is still there you know
    its dead as fuck but here you go   i cant be your cosplay gf as im a dude but i will get a beer with you on any given weekend assuming youre somewhat close
  cant be girl  cos im dude  where the fuck do you think you are
its dead as fuck  like this thread should be heh
  then why did u bump it 
  only way to kill this thread is to post in it since the same autist bumps it every10th page
think we can keep it up until sakura con 2019
dumb
  is that what you want  we need a new thread for a new year let it die
  where do you think you are  not /lgbt/ thats where      not that anon but i think itd be amusing we can have a new thread when sak 2019 actually gets rolling were usually 23 threads in by the time the con actually starts so why not let this take the place of at least the first one
  pretty sure thats what that person who keeps bumping it every page 10 is trying to do and its dumb
agreed
if any of you are interested in visual kei due to mana on the cover we currently have very active a discord group with lots of fans of 90s/2000s music including malice mizer stuff      would be sweet to see some new fans joining    as a bonus here is manas band before malice mizer that i ripped and uploaded  
no im good thanks
  glad the community is still alive and active
damn it
  this aint it chief
a hippopotamus in burando    post and discuss dds here    old thread 
god im on a pretty strict nobuy for the next few weeks but of course if the church choir flare op comes up in black ill probably sell my right arm for it     as for the rest i organized and decided that my styles been shifting a bit and i realized i have other items i need more like why didnt i know the baniran lovely hearts dress had a matching jacket so here i am     im pretty deadset on every colorway except for the pleather skirt id love it in black too     while im blabbing does anyone else love buying full sets of things that are harder to find or get excited about finding items you previously didnt know went with your main pieces     also how often do you feel your wardrobe changing does it stay about the same or do you like rotating your closet a lot i feel like mine changes a lot but keeps a lot of the same general color scheme     sorry for the blogpost just excited to talk about dresses since im recieving some pretty personally coveted pieces very soon

continuing to pray for moitie rereleases im hopeful and the latest glut of ap rereleases also makes me think mrc has a chance     christmas is coming still no traumerei in the only cut i want    missed out on vampire nocturne on ww rip but it was overpriced and halloween just ended so im thinking a better oppertunity will pop up by next year minimal heartbreak at least    in accessory dreams i snagged that iw ushanka on mercari im so excited to get it ive always wanted it but i dont let myself have dream accessories since theyre so rare and no one sells them i cant believe it finally popped up in black
  silent moon will be hopefully be rereleased in 2019 get hype  
ill take the sax and/or pink colorway of colorful ribbons i already have the lavender op anon from previous thread told me about the one on mercari but its missing the back satin ribbon and its out of my budget possible scalper anyway      i see youre an intellectual of fine taste i hope you find them
  aw thanks anon same to you colorful ribbons is so cute but i only ever see it damaged/missing pieces as well so i hope you have some better luck soon
oh god the pain
the dim light long jsk in green is haunting my dreams and it gets worse the closer we get to christmas itd be amazing to get it before christmas but im trying to not get my hopes up too high
the jsk is lovely but doesnt satisfy my needs looking for the crown and cross op and capelet by innocent world
  my wardrobe changes a lot and there is a lot of turnover with my dresses i flip between a wardrobe with a theme and a well rounded one my budget is blown though so im trying to be on a strict no spend unless its for christmas gifts freeze but its lucky pack season
  i own this in blush you wont be disappointed anon thinking about you when i do my obsessive mm sweeps online    please let me be a comfy plaid princess this christmas
please
  fuuuuck ill be so pissed if they only release weird colours
still searching
i removed one dress from mine since last time decided it was no longer a dream dress and was more of a wtb good luck everybody
is the anon who posted it a few weeks back still searching for this jsk i consider selling it
  sorry to say this but wow this is the worst thing i have ever seen
  cat hoodie is really cool would work marvelous over ctp piece
  ahh thank you so much i truly appreciate it
  you must be really new because ive been posting these to this thread for a long time    also thank goodness we dont all have the same taste
  oh wow im so happy ahhh thanks for sharing this with me anon i dont have twitter and i do remember when eternal twilight was happening girls mentioned silent moon but i was never aware of moitie confirming a rerelease tanaqro takeover gets a 10/10 from me
  twitter  i mean instagram but that neither really should get those to keep up with brand releases      nayrt but i personally love the diverse tastes i see in these threads from the oldschool lovers to the moitiefags to the ap seekers and people intent on one thing most of the time being classic  its so cool to see the spectrum of styles here on cgl
  its so cool to see the spectrum of styles here on cgl  complete agreement its really neat how different so many of peoples dds are from things we often see on cof and insta have noticed a lot more classic also dream dresses represent a yearning that transcends social media trends
  just pointing out that im still desperately looking for the shoulder ribbon jsk 2005 in red in case someone finds it
these cuts and colors only
  haha how much did they ask for it
  nayrt but considering they made a scalping joke i bet the scalping part wasnt actually a joke
    turns out they didnt want to sell they just wanted to see how much someone would be willing to pay for it
  thats shitty im sorry anon
  some people are just genuinely disgusting
  that is really awful im sorry anon
    i dont blame them or have animosity i just wish they would have said something along the lines im not really interested in selling atm but how much is this worth so i wouldnt have had my hopes up im hopeful that one day ill find it ive seen japanese auctions selling the gray one lately
  the way they worded it sounded like they were looking to sell which is still shitty of them to do for getting you excited for nothing
  wow that is awful sorry
i dont know if anyone wanted it in purple i recall two wanting it in green but metas secret laboratory jsk mini length is up on lm    
i saw some of these pop up recently too but tuition  lolita good luck to everyone looking for their dream dresses
  surely elizabeth op should be number one priority
  that cut/colour isnt that rare was rereleased a bunch
  true its been my number one dream dress since id ever started lolita but everything i see it i chicken out of the price
 if anon is still looking for it
feels bad the closer it gets to december ughh
  you sure you want this anon i bought it when it first came out and the quality is pure shit print chiffon pulls easily and wunderwelt resold it for less than half of what it cost i ended up trading the set away for another set im sure youll find it but idk you could have better
  you sound like such a fucking drag
  nayrt but theyre just trying to warn them
  sorry that im trying to warn you this is literally a very poor quality dress and you could have better but hey money doesnt fix shit taste
  cackling
  anon id be grateful to receive a warning before buying a dress there are other christmas prints and you can do what you want but she wasnt being mean
    it went on sale on the ap japan site for literally 9000 yen too
  thats what i was saying its value reflects its shit quality and lack of demand its throwing money down a hole
reposting from bst thread my sweet mate kumya bear ears in brown only interested in this particular edition with wire do they even pop up on sale i only saw pink ones somewhere in october or something
  relax on the salt i was just adding more info to prove your point
i was able to get the xl white kells skirt posted in the previous thread thank you so much to whoever posted it it is very very large on me so i am going to alter it when i have more free time but if a medium pops up in the meanwhile im still keeping an eye out now the haenuli skirt is my current remaining quest
      caplet on closet child
still looking for this beauty
  what app did you use
  ayrt app not sure what you mean if youre asking how i made the dress collage i did it in photoshop if you mean what ss did i use for the skirt i mentioned/was trying to buy during the holiday/bad weather i used spreenow if youre asking something else then _ツ_/
looking for the wine dress in burgundy
  sorry i was asking about the collage indeed looks so clean
a dd popped up on wunderwelt but im just too apathetic depressed does anyone else get this sometimes
  get it now enjoy it later happiness comes in waves youre probably on a downswing get it so you can enjoy it later when the downswing is over
im a tranny can i cosplay as felix or astolfo or would it be in bad taste
  i see how it is
  trannies are in bad taste desu
who has benis all have benis
  wouldnt it be rude to not be a trap when you dress like them
      trannies  gross  cross dressing boys  hot
  no such thing as a trap in person his adams apple and manly voice will give it away
it would be bad taste to not do it
  theres a reason felix wears a sub choker and astolfos collar covers his neck
  do you know what felix argyle is
erica from catherine your only choice
  a drawing
  of a dude
  you cant just stick a dude name on an anime girl and act like feminine penis exists irl
  i have pics if you want to argue
cosplay what fits you the best and i hope you do well in your endeavors
  im confused how could it possibly be considered to be in bad taste thats the character isnt it
  felix is a cute boy who cross dresses for fun    op is a mentally ill freak who takes hormones and wants to cut his dick off and gets triggered if you call him by the wrong pronoun
  anon doesnt know about femboys  i feel so sorry for you missing out on the finer things in life
  you sound pretty triggered about it anon  inb4 im a tranny or a handmaiden  not even but i just think anyone foaming at the mouth about those things need to calm down
  tfw an accurate description of trannies is so extreme that sjwchans think its triggering
  not a sjw as i hate them and its not triggering i even admit being trans is a mental illness and a lots of them are fucking weirdos nice try though i just think its funny that for someone going on about being triggered your jimmies sound rustled 
  calls someone triggered  hurr durr going on about being triggered eh    thinking trannies are gross isnt being triggered anon kun 3 3 3
  it probably depends on how well you pull it off people are extra judgey on anything feminine     good luck wither way
if you can pull it off its ideal but most cant
      youre not fooling anyone you fuckin tranny
  youll be judged as a man which might be desirable if youre trans man but opposite if youre trans woman
how is this thread still up how have people not reported an obvious bait thread and gotten it deleted yet
    someone has a different opinion reee reee u a tranny u triggered xd  whatever helps you sleep at night anony
op i will suck your dick if you cosplay felix or astolfo  no homo
  dont white knight the mentally ill
who gives a shit
nice thread guys    as somebody who has done a pretty decent felix cosplay theres nothing wrong with doing so that said youre going to attract an awful lot of strange attention its like open season on yourself somes good but a lot is bad and creepy as hell id personally never do it again if youre worried about how people percieve you have a thick skin and accept whats going to happen or just dont try it
op here idk what i expected lol thanks for the legit opinions to the helpful ones
  not trying to whiteknight honestly but i just feel sorry for them the real onesthat is that might come of as dumb but what can i say im a big fucking faggot full of feelings
  op is a mentally ill freak who takes hormones and wants to cut his dick off and gets triggered if you call him by the wrong pronoun  holy shit this is gold
  dont be discouraged by the hate comments do what you feel is best being trans and choosing a trap character is as appropriate as anyone else cosplaying him people in real life wont be as cynical also big props to you for saying you are trans on 4chan i wish i could do the same
  but you just did say youre trans anon
  yeah but to start a thread with that and to make it so you actually have to read it but since its out of the bag im a ftm looking to make some friends if you want to
  it is the standard 4chan definition of trans people literally posted dozens of times a day
  making friends based solely on gender identity  go fish on tumblr or something
  do whatever the fuck you want faggot
  honey the common interests from this conversation show that we both like rezero cosplay 4chan / the general internet and lgbt culture i wouldnt say that is too out of line to try to make a friend here im not just a chaser
  this is weirdly positive
  of course you can how the fuck would it be bad taste
  hey anon just wanted to say you seem pretty cool its always a hot meme to be a dick on the internet so good on you for reaching out to others    how has your transition been going im male myself and like the prospect of dressing in pretty clothes not really attached to my gender identity but want to have kids eventually so hrt is out the window
  freeze your swimmers bro
  take it to the fag board if you want to just talk about fag things
  you arent wrong but boy does the lgbt community online get angry when you point that fact out
  i think youll find a lot of gay men think tranies are mentally ill too i think i saw one gay man and i quote there always the huge mess crying at the bar that nobody wants to talk to    end quote  but then most gay men dont want much to do with l bt anyway but they needed them for common cause
  finally
  do you still have your penis
  do you look like a girl  sure go for it  do you look like a man  go for it but youre just going to be a meme
  lgbt culture  have been meaning to ask what does this entail exactly im actually not straight either but ive never understood what people mean by gay culture and all that i dont see my sexuality as an important part of myself and it doesnt at all relate to my interests so i just dont get how lgbt culture even exists as a thing doses this mean tumblrshit like steven universe
  god no its more expansive than that tumblr lgbt culture does seem to be the loudest and the most insufferable but there are people out there that arent like that theyre just harder to find you just have to avoid the dumbass lgbt children like the plague source gay as fuck and grew up around those types
  if youre a cute boi or a dashing man with a lean and fit body then you are definitely more than just a meme if you crossplay youll get loads of dick that way or pussy if youre a faggot
  what are those nontumblr people like and what are the elements of lgbt culture as a whole im especially interested in any examples you have ive never been able to get a clear explanation ive actually dated other women in the past but none of them have ever really identified strongly with lgbt like me so ive been struggling to understand it
  theres three camps of people really the tumblr crowd who are just looking for labels to collect like pokemon the /pol/ crowd who are largely self loathing gays and transgender people who spend all day bending over backwards to prove theyre not like the other degenerates and the people who dont want to make it a big part of their lives and actually go outside
  exactly
  youre a tranny who is posting on 4chan are you really concerned about taste at this point
  this
  actually in the light novel he constantly reminds himself that he is a girl and gets testy at the other characters who use his pronous incorrectlytheres a good paragraph explaning ferris as he looks at himself in a mirror it says that the reason he never grew any facial hair is cause everyday he told himself that hes a cute girl it had some sort of magical hypnosis hormonal effect on him i would totally define this as someone who is actually trans    i mean im just playing devils advocate here though i dont think ferris is the trans icon hes made out to be when you actually look at his past he was just a heavily abused boy with some serious family issues in all actuallity he probably is mentally ill from his experiences     but at the end of the day he is just a boy who dresses cute and thats why we love him cosplay whoever you want
  it always seems like its the biggest hons who go on about trans pride and trans acceptance while the ones who look at least somewhat like the gender they identify as just want to live their lives
  this
  those who can pass pass  those who cant pass or dont want to put in the effort instead demand to be treated like they pass
what if i just want to be a cute boy in feminine clothing like pic related
  at this point the two are basically tranny icons go for it
  i feel like its in really bad taste if you actually want to be taken seriously as the gender youre trying to transition to but the fact that youre even considering it at all tells me youre just a trapfag attention whore that enjoys being creeped on by chasers so i have no qualms with any mistreatment youd get for knowingly inviting autists that dont know how to act in public    theres plenty of other nonfetishistic characters to pick from
/cgl/ newfig here and this seems like the appropriate thread to ask this question    if im a guy nontranny and want to do a convincing cosplay of a female character will corsets/waist trainers help me achieve it or are they just a meme i have pretty feminine proportions for a guy already but i need that extra edge
  theres a crossplay thread most serious crossplayers use shapewear though
  thanks friend i will check that out
  based and redpilled
  is that you ainsley
  what the fuck is this  was it edited or was this actually in the show          you guys sound based you should drop a throwaway email      ill honestly never get felix to me he doesnt look like a girl at all in the anime but everyone else sees him as a trap  he looks like a boy without facial hair and muscles desu
  that gif is a clip from a gay shota hentai lmao
  being a tranny is bad taste already  literally disgusting and a disgrace to gods creation
im a lady and want a soft trap bf
  if you want a kind answer does anyone remember the remake of the rocky horror picture show how an actual tranny was used for frank and shehe sang im just a sweet transvestite do you understand youve got a man who wants the world to believe hes a woman singing a song outlining how hes just a man who derives sexual pleasure from dressing in womens clothing so yes by any metric it would be in bad taste
tfw you aint gay but just very curious as to what its like to be a girl  tfw youre way too masculinised to pass ever    feels bad man i just want to be a cute trap for a day and wear cute clothes but i have to stick to my kpop/jfash inspired le streetwear
  sounds like youre in denial senpai pretty fucking gay
  very curious as to what its like to be a girl  not gay but possibly trans good luck exploring that anon
    i like my dick where it is thank you
why would you expect 4chan to have any good perspective on taste
im not a tranny but im challenging myself to do an astolfo cosplay in a year i wasnt going to do it but then i convinced myself that actually if i put anything aside from 0 effort into appearance i can actually look really androgynous and thats considering i was being mistaken for a girl without any effort    its probably going to take a year because either i just try to buy a load of already made parts or i try to do the shit myself  and i dont have much experience  if i give in i guess i can just pay for the pieces though    i just want to get this out of the way before i get old and regret not flirting with everyone and making some guys feel unsure about their sexuality
low test thread
  thanks me too
  you right anon you right
  based and pinkpilled
cosplay as whoever you want to and stop focusing on all this gender stuff does it really matter
  based seagull
  go on
everyone read this             
  this
  my voice is of a castrata i could imitate a girls voice if i wanted to
  why would it be in bad taste
  /thread
  no anime character should be a trans icon theyre almost exclusively bad representations
  honestly id love to but im scared to even give out my information in this thread or talk to people outside of 4chan
    lgbt culture is really just to make safe spaces for lgbt people and spread helpful information to people who would otherwise be living in secret until they kill themselves
  just do what you want to do
  he doesnt look like a girl at all in the anime  are you insane
  dont have to cut off your dick to be trans thats a meme
  no such thing as a trap in person  you couldnt be more wrong they definitely exist
fuck this stupid thread enough already
  do what makes you happy and live it    most other trannies regardless of whether you look good or not are going to spit on you why bother trying to please them
  i will masturbate to your photo every night if you actually do this
  most  nah most people will be fine with it or not care dont take vocal tumblr people as the majority
  pinkpilled  stop that
  hentai made by poju same one that made boku no pico    look it up
  what is acting
  poju made boku no pico
  yeah i actually got that wrong he didnt
  where do i sign up
  what is the name pls help
  natsuyasumi
  most people are ok just not most trannies
  im sure youve talked to a lot of them before saying that
only question you need to ask is will it look good or not
  this kek

  having an adams apple    your trapfu is weak
shit you deal with as a mod of your community thread ill start   people who join and dont cosplay or wear lolita    people who claim to be going to meets and dont show up and notify you at the last minute    people who feel entitled when trying to join a comm and claim i only own one piece but i dont want to invest until i get a feel of the comm
we have a 6 month probation period if you dont post or go to a meetup within 6 months we boot you we dont keep inactive members unless youve been to meets before and we actually know who you are every 6 months i always get a ton of normies and cosplayersshitty handmade and closet cosplayers bitching at me because they got removed from the group i tell them they are welcome to reapply if they plan on interacting and 6 months later when nothing happens we continue the process all over again
tfw comm leader is a fat ita    how do i usurp her
shit i deal with the other mods
im not a mod but my comm mods have to deal with an ita with a 10 year long ban and i feel for them shes made new accounts to get back into the group made her own lolita group and tries to get people to find out where and when the comm meetups are big yikes
  with a 10 year long ban  holy shit what did they do
  hello new york hahaha
theres lolita at heart girl who is friends with the mods she always comes to meets wearing normie clothes and brings her normie bf with him i feel like i would get kicked if i said badly about her
  why is she even allowed if you like lolita join a fan group but not the actual group if the only other mod in my comm was active id make this a fucking rule
  im surprised your entitled people own a single piece most of the people we get joining dont own anything    i wouldnt mind some people want the social support while theyre starting out but our mods never cull members or boot anyone so they just stay on the member list forever
  shes banned from the local lj group egl on livejournal and the facebook group for harassing members and mods evading bans with sockpuppet accounts and posting photos of gore and literal shit to peoples pages
for our comm the ask questions before you can join questionnaire that facebook added is a fucking godsend if people cant even do the bare minimum of answering three simple questions then theyre not getting in and yeah about once a year we have a meet where all people have to do is confirm attendance anyone who doesnt by the deadline typically 3 weeks is booted unless a mod can vouch for them
  people who claim to be going to meets and dont show up and notify you at the last minute    i feel so bad that i end up being this sometimes but i just get so excited to go to a meet and i totally plan to go and then i get called into work the day before or day of     im always afraid my comm fucking hates me by now
  this sounds beautiful but im pretty sure my comm doesnt have meets consistently enough to justify a 6 month cap  there are way too many lolitas at heart that dont even live in the area theres no vetting
  find a job that respects your time outside of work that isnt a way to live if its once in a while and you need the money thats different but dont let them take advantage of you too often life is more than work
  op here its more like people who say theyll be going to a meet where they need to bring food something etc text/call you all of the meet saying theyre on their way and then bam one minute before it ends oops cant go
  not a not but fuck what is it with these people ive seen multiple times people claim theyre on their way and then something happens or they just never show up what

  shut up larea

natsumichan is the cutest designer y/n
  the new jetj wedding dress     im fine with their polyester prints for every day lolita its durable and washes well but not paying 3500 to get married in polyester frills
  it looks like taobao
  how original
  i really hate it when they mix printed fabric with plain elements it looks nonsensical and stupid just make the whole damn thing out of the non printed fabric and it would be 100x better pic related made me really mad when it came out imagine it would have been only the black fabric and not that 50/50 mix with that stupid and ugly print nobody wants prints anymore its not 2012 anymore when they first came up with this shit and everyone creamed their pants over amour damants because it was a novelty nobody would buy that shitty print if it was released today
  could you post the spoon pictures i havent seen them posted anywhere
  tbf the dress you posted looks a lot nicer than the wedding dress the balance of print to ruffles works
im going to tokyo and osaka in three months and my paranoia is making me want to get one of those antitheft purses do yall think if i slapped some cutesy cheap enamel pins or badges on this it would look less ugly as sin with a coord or am i doomed to an uglyass purse ruining my aesthetic because my fear response is too powerful
  youre traveling to like the two safest cities in the world what are you worried about just bring a normal purse     if youve got a layover in a shitty place like paris just wear the antitheft purse there but in japan you honestly dont have much to worry about
  there is no way to make the bag look cute just have someone hold it while they take your picture
  japan is very safe ive literally never worried about this i just take my normal liz lisa purse and use the shoulder strap if im going to be walking a lot
  anon listen people can be shitty think of all the times in your life from childhood through to adulthood that you had a thought come into your mind to take something that wasnt yours it happens most people either block it with empathy or a sense of shame or justice never think you are safe around people there will always be some crafty bastard that goes out just looking for someone to rip off its sometimes out of need but some people do it for sport    if you are street smart and aware enough you wont need the ugly bag being wise and calmly aware is always better than being a ball of fear and anxiety which can majorly work against you   be smart but not afraid you will be fine
    its true though solids are where jetj shines they are at least gaudily opulent without being tacky their prints just push it over the edge into tacky and tasteless this it looks like cheap taobao  but then im also not a noveau riche chinese lolita
wunderwelt is selling hospitality doll on lacemarket itd probably come clean with some oxiclean dont let gemgem scalp it
  i honestly walked around with my purse wide open a few times in osaka and never had anything stolen like it is literally so safe id honestly forget to close my purse after putting my wallet back in
anyone has that problem with mercari where you cant see any picture even when clicking on the listing its been this way since this morning i wonder why
  damaged  short version no matching bloomers  pink colorway  250       gemgem can fucking have it whos she going to scalp to
  its easy to be the savest city in the world if the police doesnt officially let you report crime
  lol the only country where i never worry about pickpockets is japan maybe just keep your bag in front of you in harajuku some sketchy foreigners around apart from that youre fine with a bag that fits your aesthetic
  oh damn what please back up this statement
  thats retarded they literally let you report everything they let me report my missing cat in my own country the police would just have laughed at me
  you are traveling to a very safe country but if you are concerned or are planning on going to other countries that may have safety issues i brought pacsafe convertable bag in blush  its serviced me well and doesnt scream im a tourist but when id traveled to south america i didnt take it and kept a small undergarment purse
  yeah they let you report your missing cat which is cute and not a crime but they wouldnt let me report the assault of me and my friend because they didnt have physical proof it happened
   you   its true though  how is it looks like taobao true its literally not taobao what is it being compared to exactly other dresses that dont look the same because they are entirely different dresses  stop this dumb meme
  its the same style sure but they dont look alike besides that there a tons of dresses like this
  yeah but most of them were made by taobao shops
in the name of mana fucking why viewer discretion advised  
  does living in that house make you lose your eyebrows or
  dont recognize the lolita from london comm looks more fairy kei anyway
  lolita that doesnt actually wear lolita although i guess i saw a dress one dress  poser goth who looks like killstar threw up on her has a guitar she doesnt play and listens to fucking black veil brides    i do appreciate the contrast in their aesthetics though id be lying if i said i didnt like it
dear some lm gulls we see you when you raise your price to pretend the bf sale price is a new lower price than what youve been listing it at for the past month
  kek ive been thinking that too
did muuh raise her rates recently 1000yen per item seems absurd didnt she used to be 510 or something
  yeah she got a new job and needed to reduce her ss work load she basically added the 1000y fee because the thing that takes up most of her time is small app orders
  please tell me the model is wearing it backwards
  front bustles are a thing where have you been
  front bustles existed before taobao shops started pumping them out you do realize that taobao is full of design replicas right  see 
  lol do you even jetj this has been a thing
whats the deal with mercari i cant see any images of any listing even if i click on them
  the jp site dont bother with the american version
  yeahthe jp site its been like that since yesterday for me
  clear cookies
  already did to no avail
fuck off
  why not use the app
gullswere did the older kawaiii vids go 2012 and before i can only find a handful randomly posted by random yt accounts but the official kawaiii yt channel deleted them
very late but vm is at hyper japan in london  
  that hoopskirt looks so miserable why wouldnt they use a normal petticoat
  maybe they liked how it looks
  maybe because hoop skirts take up less luggage space
  maybe what appears to be a dress with a hoopskirt is an actual lampshade
  nothing wrong with that
  jesus do you know how long ago she raised her rates that is ridiculously high
  theyre not shutting down anytime soon i guess
  owns a guitar she never actually played  aesthetic has gone too far
    i think anon means that the way the dress and print are structured it makes a lot more sense to be facing the other direction honestly thought the same thing and giggled if that dress was all solid it would look much better
  you could literally leave your wallet outside on the ground and it would be there when you got back
  i can still see some vids from 6 years ago on their channel which ones are you looking for
  which one
  it makes a lot more sense to be facing the other direction  except that front bustles are just as common as ones in the back
  a few months ago again its mostly to lighten her load
does anyone know whats included in nahs happy bags you can choose between sweet and cool but they dont actually write what kind of clothing types are in the different price tiers
want to go to ap paris tea party  already have a 10 day trip planned around that time  i wish they announced this earlier
  notice me lamplight uguu
secrets
  well that was underwhelming
throwing together a musicnote themed coord and i cant find any of aps fancy melody socks/stuff or the piano bag anyone have any reccomendations of other stuff that could go well with it
can anyone give me a quick lowdown on the lacemarket bf event
  theres also melody doll and emily temple cute did music note socks that arent uncommon on auctions in general a lot of brands like milk have done music note clips etc that pop up on wunderwelt and cc from time to time
  no secrets about the traumerei event i was waiting for some juicy drama gulls
  just came back from japan for the 12th time this morning and am happy to report its as safe as ever literally would leave my purse on a table in a food court to save the space and then go place an order etc and not worry about it except for other sketchy looking tourists
  ah thanks i cant find any of those either desu but its something i keep finding the ap stuff in pink but im going for monochrome
  skirt and sleeveends are bomb bodice and upper sleeves an embarrassment
any thoughts on the spanish event that happened this weekend
  japanese police have a 95 success rate only because they arrest when its a guaranteed success for them     if its too hard or no theres no physical proof then they wont even bother
has anyone been at the victorian maiden stall at hyper japan in london considering catching the last few hours of it can you try stuff on
  i havent been there but from their instagram posts it doesnt look like there are any fitting rooms either way you should go and take photos so i can live vicariously through you but also theyve brought a number of releases with them so its pretty worth it to go check it out especially since you wouldnt have to pay shipping or customs
are there patterns/detailed construction images for metas walkure or hospitality doll  aasking for a friend
  i have the same problem since yesterday and cant access the app because im european wtf do i do now
  why are you so poor anon
  i think people only want those sets because theyre rare theres no point if its not the real deal or inspired by
  they brought a decent amount with them including all colourways and lengths of classical doll op the floral ops and jsks some plain ops bonnets plain skirts bags bear scarves and jewellery/hair clips the bags had macoto takahashis artwork on them they had mirrors so you could at least see if the colours suit you and the staff were friendly dresses were 260270 i bought cd in red nearly went for the bonnet as well but my bf joked id look like offred     otherwise there werent many lolita stalls compared to previous years
  nayrt but i love hospitality doll as a more old school take on the current nurse/health/menhera theme its so lovely    iirc correctly there was a nurseinspired pattern on one of the earliest gosuroris about the die walkure seti cant help yousorry
attention all work safe boards are soon going to be on the 4channelorg domain  even more facebook cancer that doesnt lurk and doesnt understand 4chan or board culture will flood /cgl/  cant wait gulls
  you have to take 10 off the price and i believe it goes by either the original or dropped price the 10 min drop button whichever is lower i dont believe raising the prices to drop would work as i have things i did really low flash sales on before and when i went to drop the price again for bf i couldnt because it was going on the ridiculously low flash sale price i put a couple things on bf but theyre so cheap it hurts while other peoples overpriced stuff will still be overpriced even if they use bf sales since theyre being rewarded for setting the price too high and never doing a price drop
  serious question is there a chance that vm arent going to close after all theyve been releasing many things going to events active on social media if they hadnt announced otherwise id think they had no intention of closing    is it wishful thinking
    their shop staff making new igs specifically has me really hopeful    i hope they saw the outpouring of support for their brand and they wont close after all    inb4 salty anon complains that a lolita brand isnt closing    fuck off salty anon
  gosurori volume 2 has a pattern for a dress thats similar to hospitality doll
    so a friend at hyper japan asked than about this and said they arent sure if they are closing but that said hyper japan was bad for sales so who knows
  can you explain this a bit more
  the app still works for me i am in europe as well    the website works as well it still shows me the images
  get ready to see the term newfag a whole lot more
  4chan is going to be split into two separate websites all of the blue boards are going to be moved to a separate domain 4channel while the others will remain on 4chan this change seems to be for the purpose of making more money off of advertisements on the work safe boards because a lot of companies dont want to advertise on websites that has porn or controversial contentthe biggest concern that people have with this is that the new 4channel domain will start to censor offensive speech in order to appease advertisers
  no mainstream company is going to want to advertise on anything even remotely associated with 4chan the new site will still be more complicated than facebook and those types of people dont use image boards or forums  theyre too lazy to use anything other than social media if it is set up as a social media platform like amino people wont stay long as they wont be able to handle harsh feedback
  unpopular opinion time jej is has been for a few years taobaotier garbage for burando prices most of their stuff is either hideous or unwearable daily   when they do something good they do it so fucking good but when its bad its not even worth wearing let alone spending money on
  fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfcuk
  it looks trashy and cheapanon sorry for your shit taste    i seriously considered bidding on this just to run up the price for gemgem
  uhweirdi wonder why it does that thenits the same on my phone even if disconnected from my local wifi and on my sos pc
  is this even an unpopular opinion anymore even the people in my comm who love to show off their jetj status pieces admit that the quality has gone downhill and theyre overpriced compared to other japanese brands  its such a bummer the jetj pages in 00s glbs used to be my favorites and i regularly hunt for their older pieces secondhand it sucks that ill probably never buy anything new from them directly
  may mana bless you anon thank you for the report
  its not going to be different in function just what isnt allowed  if you actually read the fucking announcement at the top of the page youd see that you can still access cgl from 4chan domain christ
  cheap  theres that word again  also its not even my style i wear mostly sweet ap
  install the app with a vpn anon
  kek why bother looking for it when i could have it made idc for the sentimental value me likes design        my angels  thank for the tip
so whats the deal with lauretta rose some of the stock photos on iws website show a butchered version while some of the photos are the regular ie not fugly version what are they actually selling
  hospitality doll frequently sells for around 250350 though with some selling for higher that would be the same cost if not cheaper as commissioning it with nice fabric from a good seamstress    d walkure would probably be cheaper to commission though
shouldnt we try to put together some sort of template for general threads especially with a bigger number of newbies lately itd be helpful and maybe it would eliminate some part of questions that seem to come up all the time sticky is also outdated and missing a lot of helpful links
  one of the photos is labelled sample and another has a note about gathering im guessing theyre selling something closer to whats shown for the chocolat ver not entirely sure did they post on other social media at all
remember the quiltkei dress it seems to be finished and its not as bad as i thought it would be
  dang thats not bad at all i dont love it but it looks better than anyone could have expected i think  i still dont know why she cut the dress up i hope it was damaged but it doesnt appear to be on tumblr this poor dress is cursed
  do you not understand that cheap has nothing to do with price i am not that anon and i dont think hd is cheap looking but i can see why they think that compare it to other meta dresses with tons of lace pintucked nice removable pieces so you customize the look    simple dresses can still look expensive when theres lots of nice material and the cut is perfect this isnt one of those
  looked good on instagram but the lack of replies here has me wondering
half way through novembersweetie violet when ap
shipping outside of russia 50    yo what i dont even pay that much in shipping for shoes
  idk exact rates but russia has a pretty terrible postal system
  fuck really its a really nice dress but shipping would be halfagain the cost of the damn thing
  theres one up for sale on wunderwelts lm if u wanna start a bidding fight with gemgem
  do you not understand that cheap has nothing to do with price  are you fucking esl or something look up the definition of cheap you fucking moron
  yea you need to look up the word cheap it doesnt mean whatever you think it does
  most of my dresses are jetj and i agree some of this shit has raschel lace saving grace is that it all washes well
  any way to tell what year usakumya was released
  if i had known they were going to have a stall with so much stock i would have saved up especially after seeing the announcements i thought they were only going to be in the fashion show seems like poor publicity on hjs part i hope vm dont take their bad hj sales to heart
i see anons mention every now and then that they wear lolita items with nonlolita outfits like rectangle headdresses or blouses with otherwise normie or western goth styles does anyone know anyone on instagram or elsewhere that does this and posts pictures id really like to see examples of how theyre wearing it
        try again retards
  while im spoonfeeding let me point out to you that its under 2a of inferior quality or worth    so regardless of the actual price if the workmanship materials aesthetic or quality is poor its worth it can be considered cheap please learn to google before asking other people to
so im in the market for a new petticoat last time i needed one it was when classical puppets was good however ive now heard that theyve gone bad and to avoid them is there a go to place now
  i think a lot of people will recommend me likes tea but i prefer and romeo especially for cupcake and theyre faster than me likes tea
  me likes tea  and romeo  youre a star thank you anon
    sweet lolita   not understanding that price  quality  the absolute state of modern apfags
    i have a petticoat in the works right now from melikestea i also splurged one one from ranova/blingup when they were at a local convention good golly miss molly are they luxurious
  aurora  ariel on taobao make great massive and dailysized petticoats too mine are holding up perfectly
  no mainstream company is going to want to advertise on anything even remotely associated with 4chan  keep telling yourself that theres already proof for years of viral marketing on /v/ to name just one example some boards are literally where its at for producers and im guessing /a/ can be seen as a market for lots of japanese companies who want to reach out towards the west and us
    okay thanks ill look around ill want medium poof since im more into daily wear
  i actually was thinking that this is a great thing it will deter casual posters and really cut down on the trashiest of crossboarders unless they are really determined
  you can still access cgl from 4chan domain  for nowsoon the two domains will not link to each other
  this is cute
  i submitted a secret but i did it on my phone and i think i went over the size limit
    try the brand tags soft lolita or casual lolita or variants of them     someone tried to restart the daily a la mode hashtag on insta as well worth a shot searching up dailyalamode as well
    im just worried about this already slow board loosing even more foot traffic
  i kind of wish people would name pieces when they make claims like this give us an idea of which high quality old pieces vs low quality new pieces
  well people who have owned the first release and rerelease of dragonchan have noticed a drop in quality heres a writeup
  youre a fucking idiot if you think those dresses from jetj look cheap and have poor craftsmanship you really are reaching in order to use an overused word if you can use a dictionary maybe you can use a fucking thesaurus to come up with better adjectives
  the one on the right looks better to me
  i dont think the print quality is the issue its other details
i know this is a long shot but here goes    does anyone have lolita brushes/stickers/stamps for using in like photoshop anymore google isnt bringing up any results for me    hanakolovely used to have a ton of cute ones way back in the day but they havent been available in years im sure theres nobody out there with them still saved either but if you happen to be out there person who still has them please consider sharing
  that doesnt sound like a drop in quality other than the lining which is sad but not surprising    what do you expect them to do though about the velvet if their original supplier closed
  same here there were a fair few things on that stall i would have saved up for and bought if i had known they were actually bringing dresses and accessories too i also thought they were coming purely for the fashion show
  i did not make the post about j et j i am just responding to your dumb comment about the word cheap it can mean chintzy not just inexpensive that is literally my sole point although i dont like j et j i do think the material looks luxurious and nice from what i can tell
  the discussion started because someone called that dress cheap and like taobao but ok keep using your over used word even though you have the capability to use words like chintzy just keep saying everything is cheap because thats the dumbass cgl way
  would be great for a mori/lolita hybrid
  thanks ill do that next time it reappeared all of a sudden today thoughdont know what happened there
is infantamoe a lolibrary mirror or is it its own thing i cant quite tell
has anyone ever had a lm listing disappear it is very clearly not a replica and isnt under any of the unsold sold or selling tabs im starting to think i accidentally hit delete i just dont know how that couldve happened
any scandinaviafags that knows how long it usually takes for wunderwelt to reach our icy cold polar bear asshole part of the world
  did you ship ems usually about a week ems and maybe two for epacket for me but customs is super slow around this time of year so results may vary
  sometimes lm mods just delete what gets reported without checking properly i had a maxicimam skirt deleted because some newfag thought it wasnt really lolita
  never heard of that site before its definitely not a lolibrary mirror but it looks pretty similar id be curious to know more about it too
  they must be a bunch of itas then because ive reported a couple horrible normie offbrand things and those didnt get removed
    all you need is common sense i have traveled 20 countries and never got robbed one hobo tried to come too close to paris but i told him to fuck off in finnish that works every time painu vittuun perkele     in short take care that you are aware what is happening around you and dont be an idiot you wont get robbed
what waist size are unshirred etc skirts normally are they smaller than their unshirred dresses i cant find it on lolibrary
i hadnt looked at the btssb online shop in a long time got directed to it from a recent search and i thought i was on a scam site the design looks just like a chinese knockoff page why did they do this
  yes its a chinese mirror when lolibrary is broken it doesnt work either but you can still use it with google
  i know its so ugly and definitely not an upgrade
  i dont know how indicative it is of the brand overall but i have two unshirred etc skirts though theyre pleated skirts nothing lolitaesque and theyre typical size s/m waist of like 6570ish or at least thats what wws listings said my waist is 67 and theyre the kind of skirt where i can put it on but i dont wear them when i anticipate eating a lot since its a bit tight    most brands in general have smaller skirts than their dresses like for example aatp/baby have had larger and larger jsks the past few years to the point where theyre huge on me but their skirts are still the same 6575 shirred size as always
  this i was bidding on an item without a bin item and the item just vanished it was clearly not a replica since a picture of the tag was there 
  it couldve been deleted by the seller if there were no bids until then there is a delete button which removes the listing completely    mine is weirding me out because i swear i didnt delete it iirc you have to confirm it after clicking the button
has anyone been dealing with this bug on mercari when item you find from search is not displayed on sellers profile does it mean they deleted the listing
why did jetj change their website yet again where are all their older instock prints you can buy im really not enjoying the layout    on that topic does anyone actually like the archaic layouts japanese websites tend to use babys is another one that changed i dont like i just think basic html sites are easier to go through even if theyre not flashy im having having to scroll down over and over and seeing weird abstract junk like doors and teacups on jetjs as if its some cryptic front for a secret lolita cult i just want to look at dresses
  pretty small the two i own are around 64cm waist i think
moities new jewelry looks cheap and basic as fuck im sad
are there any brands other than maxicimam that carry cute winter coats over 100cm in the bust/ 40cm shoulders    tfw im not even plus size just live in cold climate and want a cute jacket that i can layer shirts and sweaters underneath without feeling stuffed
  some dreamv coats go up to 100cm in l or ll sizes
  10039664  just means the listing is old i think seller might not have logged on in a while though idk for sure just speaking from experience
jetjs newest managed to put cats and lobsters in the same print and to add insult to injury its on some sort of netting instead of their thick fabric lobster chan is going to be a no from me dawgs
  i live here and travel between both cities youll have zero problems i usually use my purse or a handkerchief to save my spot at tables in crowded cafes then carry my wallet and phone with me to the register to buy my coffee       my police and nice and give me friendly greetings but i know not to report serious crimes to them as a foreigner theyre not going to prosecute my rapist if he is a native japanese
im dying to hear some drama from the grand embassy come on eu lolitas make my day as a far away american
  received an order yesterday that i placed on the ninth   about tenfourteen days seems to be standard
  cats and lobsters  whats that supposed to be an obscure persona5 reference
  i need this
ive never ordered anything on fb before i want to get that kitten letter dress but their fb shop is confusing do i just message them and ask for a dress do i get to pick what cut or how does it work
lmao moite what is this etsy tier shit
  not everything is full of drama salt begone
  that jewelry is hideous side note is that fannyrosie as the model or does she have a doppelgänger that also lives in japan
  it is her
  fanny looks a little derpy here and that jewellery looks cheap as hell    anyone feel like moities quality has dropped since being bought by wunderwelt   i saw some of their releases irl and was really not impressed fuck the chinese srsly
watch out for replicas on japanese auctions anons the chinese are frustratingly fast
  not even fanny can this jewellery look elegant it looks like cheap halloween jewellery
do any anons own queen bee shoes could anyone offer an opinion on quality sizing etc please and thank you
  someone in my comm owns one model of the queen bee boots in all the colours i am guessing its super comfortable
i ate too much cream and im very lactose intolerant so if i die i just wanted to say i love all you salty seagulls and i hope you get your dream dresses
  fanny looks a little derpy here  sorry but why are you saying this
  you have to click over the image in the collections and pray for stock to buy anything thats a past release on there now
  fanny lives in japan
    its the weird centerparted hair  classic moite shoop but also i need fanny to model some moite that isnt just cheap jewelry
  her fingers look strangely stumpy for someone as tall and thin as she appears not to mention the angle kind of makes her look like she has an underbite this is probably mostly due to how she was photographed though im not sure why they thought it was an ok job
  goddamn i am usually not someone to comment on teeth not looking white but hers look like witches teeth  i think shes really pretty but recently ive been noticing this in more and more photos of her
  do you not understand how shadows work
  if you die pls donate all your brand to us
  she isnt tall but really this is crazy nitpicking
  it is but along with what all the other anons mentioned the way she was photographed makes you blink a few times when you see her like the teeth thing no ones saying she isnt pretty and no one is attacking her looks its just that it was photographed in an unfortunate way
  shes only 161cm  i wouldve never guessed honestly
  after a toilet trip i feel better and i regret my words no one appreciates me so youre not getting my precious brand
  same it looks like she got lipstick all over them or a bad smoking/coffee habit      shadows dont look like that anon
  clearly no one knows how shadows and bad pixelization work here her teeth look fine
  oh anon what a reach its ok to admit you used a word wrongly how embarrassing
  what do the circles mean i cant see a difference besides colors
  the ribbons are too long and dont centre on the corner its not about colour
  the length of the bows and how far they spread out
  the japanese text on the left says short ribbon upper right says that the ribbon hangs around the logo area bottom right text is wondering if there are legit bags that have the short ribbon i think
  its the weird dead fish eye stare and parted lips really like shes spacing out but not in a good way   i just dont think this is flattering also fanny stop defending yourself on cgl
  i got the socks recently and the lace quality was awful someone also posted a review on instagram of theirs and it looks bad as well
  she has so much beautiful hair what a crime to pin it back into a plain chignon the whole look is matronly but hopefully there are better photos
    there are many dutch still life paintings that contain lobsters flowers etc i assume this is the inspiration for the dress
  the colors and shape is nice
      thanks i knew it wasnt the color but couldnt quite tell which was the auth to compare to
  makes her look like she has an underbite  the fuck outta heree
  sorry i work in retail and i get real sick of people like you throwing that word around it doesnt fucking apply here
  im definitely not fanny lmfao holy shit lol  listen there are tons of models who pose like this and those people arent getting the same kind of hate  admit your bias
  cause the rest of them dont look derpy when doing this why are you so triggered by someone mentioning this anyways if youre not her  no ones saying shes ugly she just doesnt look that great in this photo sorry we think your goddess aint perfect
  your wishes were heard anon
    where is the price info and time i cant find what hour of the day
  i dont give a shit about another mto i spent over 300 ont the sweetie violet mto in april i want my damn dresses i dont want to wait another 7 months for my shit there has been zero information released since i threw down my money months ago
  lol chill ap mtos are usually delayed by a month or so from the estimated release date and they never give any update info until release what would they even need to update you on
why the fuck
  ppl like you are so stupid and ungrateful this is a reopening of the same mto with extra limited spots because there is extra set for jan release think about what that means for your stuff
  really i went to go see them in person and they were gorgeous the lace was soft and beautiful
  im laughing so hard at this mental image of a lolita making a long journey just to see some socks
  the embroidery looks cheap though heres the post that i saw and im having the same problems that shes having with the lace  
  how the fuck thinking of the amount of dresses out there with missing waist ties because theyre just sitting in somebodys closet frustrates me so much
  not rereleasing the dream sky skirt
  it really bummed me out when i saw this and it bummed me out even more when i heard about the socks not being good i want better from you moitie please dont let me down
  my heart really hurts for those dresses there is literally zero reason they should be separated and sold off separately
      im raging at the dreamy baby room ties its currently one of my high priority wishlist items and im going to shoot myself if it finally pops up and its the dress missing these
  dat pink and lav sweetie violet  dat every single color dream sky jsk    be still my heart
  i bought 2 pairs and only wore one so far i liked them but im gonna reeee so hard if the other pair has sloppy lace
  yes and usually when the estimated release month happens and there is no release they usually state something like hey sorry x mto is delayed an extra month or orders are shipped out to store locations first batch will be mailed out by next month after quality inspection       i dont even know what thats suppose to mean i dont give a shit about an extra mto opening i already bought one of everything in every color available im ungrateful if anything ap should be happy people like me are buying into their mtos and making them profitable it isnt unreasonable to throw down 1k and expect the company i put money into after they tell me that my item arrives in november to tell me when to expect it when november comes and almostgoes and it hasnt arrived especially when theyve been more communitive in the past about such issues
  but the eta for sweetie violet was late november to december at least for ap usa if you ordered through an ss then idk
  cgl logic at its finest
  whats with ap and their lazy ass patterned prints so far their winter releases have been one disappointment after the other am i the only one who feels like this
  i like the print and the jsk cut but im more tired of them using polyester for every release
  i have reported these as replicas to no avail the items titles and descriptions are full of red flags for example the title in japanese translates as for people who like angelic pretty the description also reads got it as a souvenir from abroad when any item says it was bought abroad or is from a foreign brand 海外 they mean china finally it is also described as having rough stitching im very surprised that more and more items like this appear on y auctions mercari and fril be careful read and translate to the best of your possibilities
  yeah theres also that
  wow this is some very bad photography fanny rosie is usually gorgeous and its clear she is pretty thin but this photographer and editing makes her look super old and like she has kind of chubby arms and hands she probably could have made this work much better if she took the photos herself
  which color do you want i might sell since i wanted the jsk mainly
  for some reason i read this in the voice of tim gunn
  different anon but im looking for the skirt in lavender
  it just looks a bit muddy
new bags from lief  
for those who dont check ww much theyre having a bf weekend coupon
from the btssb facebook  1/2
  2/2
upcoming baby ponytail releases in case anyones interested  1/2
  2/2
  yeah i agree theyve been all over prints where are the border prints only ghost night bride was and it didnt seem to sell well
  pu  well i cant say im not surprised
  same i want a nice cozy warm fabric with some weight to it
does anyone know if the latest ap releases are still made in myanmar
  all of aps recent releases have been so ugly desu id kill for one decent border print not involving chiffon
  i know that feel anon i feel like every time i see dreamy baby room pop up its either missing the waist ties or the brooch which is one of my favourite parts of that series
  wheres my wolf print  h  e  r  e  s    m  y    w  o  l  f    p  r  i  n  t
  they are always a few weeks too late without notice so when they say november youre lucky when it arrives next week
  mfw everyone been bitching about border prints being hard to wear last couple of years  mfw everyone been saying border prints are like wearing a picture  actually i have no face because people are bitching about ap for the last 5 years now no matter what they release and theyre still going strong
  maybe you have a very deep hate for who you are and what you look like naturally
  please stop using lolita for your fetishes
  why do i want to be a sissy  because you have serious mental health problems go seek therapy and leave us alone you fucking disgusting tranny
  why why is everyone so obsessed with sex i hate being an adult everyones the same and only wants to talk about fucking i just want to read about lolitas go away with your normie sex stuff please
  it varies depending on the release which release are you talking about
  tfw i have a ss for it  hopefully this isnt one with 59 subsequent reservations where i could have just reserved it myself eventually    im so fucking happy about this dress though hopefully it isnt fixed size
  i agree but you need to chill c
  im hoping the paris store gets it so i wont have to use a shopping service most of my friends have teased me for liking it so i hope it doesnt sell out in every cut/color super fast this is my dream
im thinking of putting some items up for sale for bidding on ebay what kind of starting bid is usually good im nervous about putting it as something small but i always hear thats the best way to sell
  i used to sell professionally and i havent in awhile but i usually only put auctions if something was really rare or i didnt know what the price would be all my auctions always sold for a lot less than buy it now
  i cant tell if i love or hate this
  cursed fucking sales page
am i the only one who wants prints of savory foods i can only think of this and the pizza dress
  of course youre not the only one plenty of people have bad taste
  i hope you are the only one these foods are not kawaii
  exactly these winter prints would look awesome if they were cotton or that thick fabric that old baby dresses have
lmao you can see who raised the price to make it look like they reduced their listings for bf thats a lot of people
also what does the top pick option mean who chose them
  nvm they changed it and now all of the beforeprices are completely wrong
since the full picture hasnt been posted     jetj  fleur et camée  reservation period 23rd november to 7th december  available in grey and black   
  ange etc camée jewelry same reservation period       
  ange et camée  sorry
  i was excited when this was first announced but man those are some fugly colour choices the print is too small and i hate how its copied all over dress totally ruined for me
  p sure that the mods just chose them
  they fucked up and put down the old buy it now price the same as the old bidding price at least thats what happened with my sales so my stuff didnt look as on sale because my bidding price is definitely lower than my buy it now they fixed it now though so w/e
  i see now it seems like the only accurate beforeprices are the ones in usd and there are still some listings where the bf prices are the same or even higher i guess those sellers just tried to cheat
  either the lining is fucked up or the chest part of that dress is a shitty thin material there shouldnt be that many creases visible the only dress i have that does that is a cheap taobao jsk
  i hope not a lot of the top picks are ugly just changed the bidding price for items no one bid on for months to their bin or are sold by resellers
its finally happened floorlength dresses are lolita now     whelp
  i think the aesthetic is different but i love floorlenght lolita dresses i wouldnt bother telling someone their coord isnt really lolita just because the dress is long
  ew
  im 53 and ive stood next to this model irl without heels while she was in heels it makes me thing that dress will be justbelow the knee for many lolitas  btw shes a sweet person not trying to make fun of her height
    the last time floor length dresses were discussed its because some taobao brand made gone with the wind cosplay dresses and then called them lolita which then got posted onto lolitaupdates and got wildly debated     oddly enough people were more willing to admit floor length dresses as non lolita it being an actual gone with the wind cosplay doesnt seem to disqualify a dress from being a fucking actual costume and not an actual lolita outfit    idk man people are so weird this isnt even the first time ap has made floor length dresses
  anon this made me chuckle
  this wont be floor length on my giraffe ass
  honestly i really want this even if it is catering to chinese lolitas
  i was about to order this until ap announced the floor length dress always go for brandu
  itll look yuge on them though why would it be pandering to them
  i think this is just ap trying to go a more sophisticated route there have always been a few longer dresses but most were the haute couture ones
     currently there is already two long length ops on the ap sf website wanted to mentioned / show that to just compare to this new series
  how tall is she
  i dont know exactly but i was in flats she was in ap high heels and i could see over her head so from that and then looking at this picture i am making a guess and this is a guess not precise at all that for me the dress would be midcalf or tealength and for a taller girl it probably would not go any higher then at the knee of course this is all guessing but i wanted to bring this up before people got worried that the dress would be too long for short lolitas i hate it when maxi dresses assume you will be wearing platforms with em
  the internet says shes 160cm/53 im not sure why she looked so short to 53 anon
i guess the usakumya face bags with logo bows are in store only for black friday the web post was not very clear and now im sad
so when exactly did rainies become a shop
  thats fucking it watch out for next week gulls
  i feel like ap especially has been needing some change so this phase is good for now i wouldnt want all lolita to alter to this but im kind of interested
i was reslly hoping ap would actually step outside of their tiny box comfort zone and make this in decent colors but no     if ap does another print i like in the same goddamn black red offwhite and navy im going to vomit i am so sick of these colors     do more purple     gawd
  you gonna blast her t
new bread 
what are some high quality wig brands what are some absolutely trash ones to avoid
this is an unpopular opinion but a trash wig brand to avoid is dreamholic ive never seen their wigs look remotely nice outside of stock photos and up close they look oily
  just learn to style your hair wigs never look 100 right
avoid lockshop they look nice but i never received my order and apparently thats pretty common
  what if you have thinner hair my hair isnt thin but i have a lot of fine wavy/curly strands that dont want to stay in place which can make my hair look wispier and thin because it frizzes
im super picky what comes to wigs and prefer my own hair    i still have few wigs to expand my coords color palette and this maples wig is my favourite it reminds me of antique dolls    i can also recommend arda wigs
  did you get a refund
where in the world can i get a decent wig for this cosplay
  oh newfag you need to lurk more
  
  idk nonny their lighter colours look pretty nice desu
  thanks anon ill check it out    pics please
i got my first arda silky and im in love with it its one of my nicest wigs i was worried about it being too shiny but i thought it was very natural looking and brushes out super easily     i know people recommend wigisfashion a lot but i had a miserable experience with them recently and dont ever plan on ordering from them again too expensive for what you get pretty sure you can find the same wigs on amazon for half the price
  anyone know of any other good ringlet wigs i already have the maple one and i wouldnt dream of getting that one dh one
any brand that does ott sweet ap clone wigs that are good quality i know about cc kidsbut any other one
  i filed a dispute with paypal and got a refund they almost always side with the customer
cries in european
    i have the maple one but it got frizzy after a few wears does anyone have any tips on restoring ringlet wigs specifically my plan was just to individually brush out each curl then reshape it with my fingers but im worried it will wreck it completely im new to wigs in general and probably shouldnt have started with a curly one stupid questions thread is about to sage and i figured i would get more answers here
  agreed way overpriced for the quality
what are some little known brands that have one or two loliable styles then like ones black and jewish women wear daily or ones for drag queens
  drag queen wigs are almost never going to work for lolita because theyre wigs for performances and thus far too over the top for lolita usage  if you want wigs in that vein look for crossdresser lifestyle wigs theyre generally more toned down
  i mean thats not the only issue here but ok  some people have dyed hair some people have hairstyles that doesnt look good with lolita pixie cut for example  also sometimes you want a different hair color for a coord ofc real hair is the best option if possible but its not like being lazy is the only reason you would wear wigs
  unless youre cosplaying dont do arda holy fuck their wigs look incredibly unnatural because of how much fiber they have and the styles look terrible i wouldnt even recommend arda for cosplay unless youre doing heavy spiking because their wigs are genuine way too thick and look like helmets
both dreamholic and lockshop are standard aliexpress quality imo they just have cuter styles and colors than on ali but theyre way overpriced      some people have hairstyles that doesnt look good with lolita pixie cut for example    ot but pixie cut can look super cute with lolita honestly any well done hairstyle that doesnt give off a butch vibe can look good imo
  i like wearing wigs because my natural hair is super fine and flat and wont hold volume plus i cant have bangs because i work as an incostume historical interpreter and blunt lolita style bangs are too modern for the period i do
has anyone tried monkeeps wigs off taobao my favorite wigs i have just gotten at beauty supply stores
  pixie pixie cuts look butch but this length is perfectly kawaii
  you know that the model in the picture you showed doesnt have a pixie cut but long braided hair in pinned up right someone with an actual pixie cut their hair would most likely look more flat than this
  nayrt but i think they just meant bob length is cute than pixie id have to agree bobs are so cute but pixie is too little volume for lolita imo
  the hairstyle you posted still uses long hair and pixie cut looks butch only if the person is wearing a tomboy fashion style otherwise it can look very feminine and elegant think audrey hepburn
  pixie cut can look super cute with lolita  im not saying they cant but its a lot harder than just regular long hair since it can easily kind of clash with the cutesy feminine aesthetics of lolita  i personally love girl with pixie cuts and i think a lot of girls can look adorable in them but when i had really short hair it looked really bad together with lolita    i love this she looks adorable it really suits that coord i still think something like ott sweet would look really bad with that hairstyle though just because the lack of volume would make it so unbalanced but for a simpler coord like this it works really nicely
  yeah i agree a pixie cut can look super cute and stylish but it is definitely harder to coord than a timeless bob or longer hair
epic cosplay wigs are the bestttt and very worth the price
  i dont know if theyre the best they tend to be shiny and not super natural looking its fine for cosplay but i can imagine lolitas wanting something less artificial looking
  if youre looking for cosplay wigs ive had good experiences with coscraft
  theyve changed their fiber blends recently the ones with the word mix are a lot more natural looking imo theyre around the same shininess as arda silky fibers i think the styles of their pish posh sister site/line are pretty natural looking
i have a couple dreamholic wigs and theyre fine but the bangs are pretty thin
  this is me otl short think frizzy hair the only way to keep it looking nice is a boy cut or a wig ive tried desperately to style it and ive given up getting a volume that actually looked nice with lolita
  theyr pretty heavy for me but then again i prefer thin bangs     also with wigs youre supposed to cut and style them especially the bangs to suit your own face you dont just take it out of the bag and wear it   it annoys me to no end when i see people with their wig bangs uncurled and poorly cut or when the wig itself has brushed curls     also people need to think what styles look good on them not some person they saw on insta
  mintymix is still nice if you ever manage to buy something before out of stock
  mintymix still sells wigs wow
  i had 2 of this style iris and returned them the bangs were thin and practically non existent both wigs also shed really badly
  i like the coscrafts wigs for cosplay but i want something suitable for lolita and eu is a wasteland for that t_t  also anyone tried the fashion line of coscraft
  you can always try hair extensions i got some ridiculously cheap ones off ebay which match my hair colour exactly and they look pretty nice its all about teasing the hair and concealing the clips hope this helps anon
  afrocare has good wigs sometimes if youre interested in gothic weaves for black ladies aha they mostly stock revlon synthetic/real mix wigs
  amazon literally i bought a wig similar to that it was hella cheap doesnt shed dont buy branded shit epic cosplay is overpriced crap
  i bet its thin and tangles easily though
  amazon has shit quality wigs and should only ever be used as last resort its literally the same as ebay wigs huge gamble of hit or miss and usually miss the fibers are thin hardly heat resistant and tangle easily best not to run your mouth when you have no idea about wig quality
  me desu i have trichotillomania my natural hair is a mess i love how wigs give me volume    i want to get into extensions but im a bit nervous trying to color match my hair through images on a computer  learning to style them into my hair 
  i wouldnt say amazon is always last resort if youre looking for a straight short to medium length wig that wont require heavy styling an amazon wig will often work pretty well
  has that happen two months of waiting until i had to reach out over twitter for anything to get refunded
  you sound like you buy overpriced garbage from arda     you can get cheap wigs on amazon and treat them for shininess not every cosplay requires heat treating a wig     dont run your mouth you fucking noob
  agreed and absolutely horrid customer service if you buy from their etsy store
  i have long hair that i style for lolita all the time but i also enjoy wearing wigs with some outfits    theres nothing wrong with wanting a quality wig just because real hair is supposedly better in your opinion
  i dont understand what the fuck chokes problem is if you dont have time to run your business anymore shut it down its such a shame because her wigs used to be really good too i remember i bought some in 2015 and theyre my favorite but i guess after that year things started going downhill in terms of quality and customer service people shouldnt have to tag choke on facebook in rufflechat comments just to find out whats going on with their orders i feel like people dont want to come after her so actively as they would if it were another lolita because she has some good coords and because of her shit with the leighs
  agreed love mintymixs wigs i wish she would get more natural colors in because the fibers are really nice for the price    anyways i usually grab wigs from brightlele ive yet to be disappointed the only minus i can think of from them is that their wig caps can be a little small so if you have a larger head or a lot of hair you may need to do some light modifications to the cap or just be prepared for your head to feel sore after a few hours of wear
  youre fucking wrong kiddo
  they havent had an etsy store in years
buy wigs from ethnic brands and stores like wigtypes hairsisters etc these wigs look natural and will actually last being used for daily wear rather than cosplay wigs which will start to fall to pieces after a handful of wears    the problem is that they usually dont come in lolitaapproved styles or colors but if you just take a few moments to learn how to add in bangs i prefer these kind of wigs to any others    pic related is only 16 on wigtypescom
im sad nobody mentioned kasou wig bought a wig from them recently and was very happy with the quality
  ive has some friends order from them just looks like taobao wigs desu that are jacked up in price but ive seen some styles they sell i havent seen on taobao so seems pretty neat
im trying to find a nice kanna wig does anyone know where i could get one
ive read dozens of wig guides and i still have no idea how to proceed   i need a high quality wig or i look awful does anyone have any reccomendations and or tips for my ashley cosplay if the wig plays nice ill probably reuse it for a lolita coord as well
so wig general    im looking for a long and straight split black/medium pink wig but i cant find much on ebay any recommendations on keywords i used mix split and two tone and mostly got ombres or halloweentier shit or any stores i should look at     kinda like pic related ponytails not necessary bonus points if straight
  look at the picture anon is replying to though that shit would be horrible from amazon      have fun with your shit tier thin wigs   and no ardas wigs are ass and way too thick   you should be heat styling your wig no matter what regardless of style in order to make the fibers frame your face better sounds like you have no idea how to style things to suit your head sweetie
does bodyline have decent wigs
  yeah from what i know theyre ok but try to look for reviews on the one youre interested in
anyone know a website who do good human hair fringe  i also know bodyline do fake fringes but im scared they look bad or will shed a lot
  i ordered wigs from dreamholics taobao store three weeks ago and they have yet to ship i know that china had their golden week holiday last week but theyre pulling a lockshop at this point
  are there styles youve had good luck with i swear all my brightlele wigs get tangled and dry after the first wear
i recently bit the bullet and ordered from lockshop wig was great and shipping took about a week and a half i think choke is getting her shit together yall
  good to hear ive been eyeing up their wigs for a while now did you order an in stock or a preorder wig
  me too anon ive bought two wigs from them and theyre very thin and shiny i was so disappointed because they were all the rage at the time     big shock i ordered from lockshop on a whim a few weeks ago and their quality seems to have improved nice thick wig not particularly shiny im not sure how their customer service is nowadays but their quality has definitely come a long way since i last ordered 23 years ago
  yikes nevermind i just saw the pieces earlier in the thread about people still not getting lockshop orders i mustve been lucky and im probably not going to risk it a second time
  in stock  i also should rephrase the shipping part to it shipped out within a week and a half and i live in the us
hi normie passing by  does anyone here know any cute wig brands/makers in the eu that are actually good quality and come in fun colours aka anything not standard blonde/brown/black/red
  are arda wigs only meant for cosplay ive never bought anything from them before only used cheap ebay wigs for low effort cosplay i really fucked up my hair from so much bleaching that im considering shaving it all off since im already almost bald and ive found arda is the only one that carries the right natural shade of dark blonde that i need
  theyre hit or miss i bought 2 and one of them is quite nice its a long curly style with bangs and its thick and not too shiny doesnt tangle much either  the other was a shorter wavy style and it was comparatively shinier and thinner i recommend looking up the product number of the wig on google and finding a review or worn pic before buying
  if you want something that passes for real hair get a lacefront wig unless you have bangs
  legit i just buy mine off amazon soak them in softener and have hairdresser cut them its always a fucking pain damn you import fees but id rather pay 75 euro for 3 wigs then drop 100 euro for a wig that turns out to be meh that i still have to style a lot myself im not a cosplayer though i cant imagine what a pain that would be
  seconding this any wig styles similar to wigs from this era of sweet  im interested in finding some
can someone help me find wigs like in op  i want some twintail wigs rthat arent those thick miku monsters i like the look of the thinner ones but i cant find them anywhere    how would i even go about searching for them
  those are from dreamholic
  ugh im looking for the same thing but in a true pastel pink or sax nothing bright or muted grey
  im more looking for pinks and such any idea where i can find them
  do not use arda unless youre heavily spiking their wigs are super thick and look ridiculously unnatural
  doesnt eu have its own comparable wig companies such as coscraft
  their wigs tangle so fucking bad too a few girls in my comm did a group order with them so i bought one on a whim and i swear every single wig looks like frizzy trash mine was so thin near the bangs/top that you could see through it half of the other girls looked nothing like the stock photos     i really dont see why people keep buying them     i agree with  that maple has some amazing quality wigs and theyre fairly cheap
  ive been interested in maple wigs but how do you purchase them  are there any shopping services that buy from them
  if you have the money just get blonde ones that you can dye and have a hairdresser dye them to match your hair color
does anyone have experience with kiracos wigs im intrigued by their ott sweet wigs     alternatively any good dupes or taobao brands for things similar to what mintymix sold i regret not buying one of those rainbow wigs when i had the chance
  finally this is the voice of reason if you want to see how bad arda is look at fucking kate they are thick as shit and no natural hair looks like that they also come super unstyled and idk about others but i like it coming remotely in some look    the reason arda is so popular among cosplayers is so they can knife into them and chisel them into weird anime hairstyles you need tons of wig hair for that they absolutely do not cater to lolitas
  this isnt lolita though this is dolly kei    im going to have to agree with the other anons that it looks too butch and has a tomboy vibe youre just in the wrong fashion style for it notice only westerners do it nearly exclusively too id consider it borderline ita and absolutely lazy
  god this looks like trash look how matted that wig looks the bottom
  her fucking wigs always look like trash and still girls lick her butt if it was anyone else theyd call her out for wearing a rat on her head
  my hair mats up like that no matter how much i brush it out or what leave in i try fml
  we get it samefag
where can i get good cheapish wigs in australia   also what about the head mannequin things
my faves for lolita are brightele and cyperous
  how do i order from maple im guessing a shopping service since they dont ship over seas any recommendations new to shopping services
  replying to a half month old post  you okay newfag ardashill
  just saying man lurk more
does arda have any standards half the cosplayers they feature on their insta look like complete shit surely enough decent cosplayers use arda right
  yea you really should lurk more dont reply to month old posts newfag
  theres no middle ground with arda its iron wig tier for cosplayers or absolute garbage
  getting angry over wigs
  dont reply to month old posts  yyoure so angry over wigs  yikes please lurk newfag
  newfag  newfag  newfag  we get it
  we  its ok newfag lurk more
  i havent posted in this thread before that but nice try screaming lurk moar newfag is always the hallmark of someone trying to sound like theyve been posting for longer than they have
  arda featured moomookun at one point the post is now deleted alongside actually talented cosplayers like heehee and j hart if that tells you anything about the company
first time buying a wig are the ones from amazon any good  i wanna get a good astolfo wig            
    i remember her makeup tutorial where she used glitter lipgloss to style her wig bangs
anyone know a good brand for 1/2 or 3/4 wigs
  head mannequins wait until daiso has the big foam heads in stock  wigs out of luck best to lurk the resell fb groups
  buddy amazon could be any fucking taobao brand and are almost always straight from china its a complete gamble and will vary per wig
  maybe this   
  amazon is extremely hit or miss and i wouldnt advise them for any long wigs that you need to not tangle
  its ok newfag lurk more
what about wigs from uniqso i saw there a wig for a cosplay that i would like to buy are their wigs nice
  they just resell random taobao wigs i dont think they purchase wigs from a specific store but i could be wrong
  just adding to this 100 agree with you like other have said really thin wigs very shiny the lighter colours ive seen in person are better but anything remotely dark is awful   i also find the wigs are a little small and hurt much more than any other wigs ive worn ive worn glw lockshop and even shitty aliexpress ones and they were all fine for comfort nothing has given me such an awful headache as dreamholic wigs it was bordering on migrane bad
  prisila is the only one i can think of for 3/4
  does anyone have good recommendations for lolita wigs and fashion wigs that suit large heads 60cm and bigger tried my luck with several taobao shops most of them were either too small or of poor quality    pic unrelated
good wig brands for gyaru
  i recently bought a mintymix wig and it is one of the fakest looking wigs i own
  also had a pretty bad experience i got two wigs one was really good but one of the ponytail clips broke instantly customer service didnt give a shit the other one looks okay the airy bangs are a nightmare though never again
other than wearing them lots in the hope of breaking them in is there any way to adjust the size of a wigs cap without messing the wig up
  i own a few lockshop wigs and so do my friends i have seen the netting on more than one occasion the stock photos often show blunt bangs but when i tried to trim one of my wigs it turned out really shitty because it seems to have been styled into a permanent side split
  cyperous
  if youre serious about getting a high quality wig save up and get a human hair one ive been wearing human hair for a while now and i just cant go back to synthetic when a human hair full lace wig is styled and worn correctly its nearly impossible to tell its not your actual hair
  yes but youll need handsewing skills and to cut the weft/back of the wig
anyone know where i can find wigmaking lace this fine and light all the swiss lace ive come across has been too coarse and/or too dark and i need to make myself some custom eyebrow and facial hair pieces
  i own one of monkeeps wigs  i really like them they get a little frizzy after a couple of wears but nothing insane they shed an average amount i have another one on the way    their stuff sells fast so check their insta when a new page pops up i like their wig quality more than dh plus youre not playing fucking roulette with your order like i did with them never buying dh off their sites again  customer service is garbage and you get the wig you actually ordered maybe like 60 of the time
  honestly yeah i mean go for it if youre gonna shave it all off anyway ardas wigs are heavy as fuck and sit on your head like a helmet earlier poster i have one of their long black wigs and that bitch takes forever to untangle and style because of the weight    if you want something closer to real hair just shop around taobao shops you dont need heavy hair in lolita fashion
i want to get a really long wig for lolita  any sites you guys would recommend seems like places like brightlele dont go quite as long as im trying to find like lower back length
anyone tried the coscraft fashion line
  whats a replacement then it seems to be a general consensus that dreamholic are just photoshopped wigs in good lighting are there some taobao wig brands that are better
  monkeep
  literally 3 minutes on google  
mintymix is great  i wish to god she would sell clip in bangs in holographic or a rainbow mixes
  i love mintymix i wish she would stock more natural colored wigs though she used to and they were really nice they still seem nice but i just personally have no use for the rainbow stuff in my closet maybe she just wants to stick to the rainbow/pastel wig market though
romance is still alive edition
  tfw havent ordered my contact lens yet  black friday might delay everything and make them arrive after con    fuck this is entirely my fault
man i just really hate moitie blue
impulse bought a bunch of fancy foods that was half my spare blackfriday money down the drain i cant believe i went whole ham over some goddamn takoyaki and taiyaki
  expensive  takoyaki taiyaki  where do u live
i keep looking through all the otakon pictures i took this year and i really miss the atmosphere and taking photos of all of these cute girls with warm smiles
  cute
  i love it i wish they did more blue solids
1/3
2/3
3/3
    just buy a takoyaki pan and make them yourself the ingredients are cheap enough if you sub in other fillings
  i just bought a lot because i never find any near me and i got over excited at twelve bucks a bag it added up faster than i expected
  bag  so not freshly served
  not linking the new thread in the old thread    whats wrong with you
      body shaming is bad  except when youre shaming the fit guy
  i got some made hot but i bought the rest bagged
  damn thats an exceptionally bad investment
i had a huge scare yesterday and genuinely thought i had to sell off all my brand and i spent my whole day crying my eyes out id rather be dead than without my brand     luckily it was a scare and i didnt even have to sell off a single dress i just need to chill the fuck out
   see dress im in love with   ask mom for dress for christmas   find out she immediately bought it despite her usual reluctance to try and get me lolitarelated gifts for fear of messing it up   comtinue to hint about the dress until christmas to make her feel extra good about the fact that she scooped it up    before you ask i afford my own lolita/life expenses 99 of the time im just floored she went out of her way to finally research what i was interested in  also  newish boyfriend  boyfriend knows im a lolita enjoys it  dress online im debating on getting after my card rolls over  ask his opinion   boyfriend starts asking pointed questions on how to use the site i was looking on  denies hes getting me the dress despite being super obvious  hes getting me the dress    im having some super comfy christmas feels here im so used to funding this hobby myself that having other people willing to buy me things is super exciting
  i could be in better shape but i choose to be interesting and educated instead or you could choose to be both im a pasty guy who sits at a desk all day hey man i have a sedentary job too somehow i manage to stay in shape and also be employed and be interesting and educated if you dont enjoy exercise thats your problem     i dont even hate fat people i just think this mindset that people must be dull or stupid if they have a decent body is counterproductive     also as an artist maybe this dudes figure drawing would be better if he actually knew what his muscles looked like not to be shady but just saying
  i was on board with you until you said you were interesting
    hes not even shaming the fit guy though hes saying people will be weird and judgemental towards everybody even fit people
ive been missing being in japan for a while its like postcon blues but worse considering how long ive had it     living vicariously through my friends posts isnt enough im thankful to have a lot of friends with weeb interests so i dont have to watch youtubers there but i need to go back and experience things i missed out on     someone ship me a case of 711 green tea and family mart fried chicken before i out myself
  somehow has a scare which would involve liquidating all assets   whoops my bad gaiz i just need to chill lul    how do you even fuck up that badly in terms of accounting do you not have a savings account with more than 10k stored
  inb4 muh buy your own shit gulls attack im really happy for you anon my bf got me baby shoes for the holidays and im excited to get him a whiskey set hes been eyeing
  postjapan blues   i keep regretting i didnt buy more jfash while i was there
  same part of it was that i was too busy hunting down for specific items second was budget the only purchasing regret was buying tops from cc since they dont let you try them on     i wish i had time to do more weeaby and totemo kawaii shit but i think id enjoy it more with some of my comm members who are really into that kind of thing
  yay its the gesture more for me ive been tightening my budget a little after a few major life expenses bought a new car paid for surgery starting to load up on furniture for an eventual move that hit my savings a little so they know im really not buying for myself much   its weird not being the person who has giftgiving down on lock this year though
tfw your bf forgets to bring the tribute to misako so the fattychans pin him down and fart on his bald head
  sounds like you deserve to be spoilt this year congrats
  been feeling this a lot i went there this spring and i thought my second trip was going to be enough but ive been craving to go back for months now    i feel like such a weeb but i really enjoy being there as a tourist
  tfw worried your bf might read this post and also forget to bring the tribute to misako
  yeah i couldnt actually live there contrary to my tween weeb dreams because their society and worklife seems so rigid but i very much enjoyed my time as a tourist because of how clean safe convenient and cordial the japanese generally are compared to my home country and other countries ive visited i wish my country would adopt some of those things it would make life a little less stressful
  thats fair im probably not that interesting if im posting on 4chan to be honest
be me  be in relationship with wonderful guy for 7 years  start considering making big life changes mega nervous  just not happy cant figure it out  start catching feels for best friend about a year ago  mutual we fall hard for each other  know id be taking a downgrade but hes just sodamngoodtome  unsure of who to cut off how to do it want a big change both options for change feel like wrong choices  both of them want to take relationship to next step  i just want to run  having nightmares mega guilt too afraid to confide in anyone    i just want it to stop having feels is too much to handle    to keep it cgl best friend is cosplay buddy and has been for a while hes looking forward to a future of cosplays together travelling to cons something i couldnt get my prior/current to do my life is stable and feels safe but theres just not much enjoyment hes for sure the less safe bet but he helps me really express myself creatively and brings so much joy through cosplay and shared interests that i cant figure out what i want out of my future i just cant even see a future for myself
  just some random anon opinion but honestly you deserve non of the guys and should make a clean cut and split up with both of them keeping your poor bf around because its comfy to have that backup guy just in case that downgrade isnt worth it in the end speaks volumes of your character you dont really care about any of the persons involved but about your own personal gain no matter how you end up deciding non of the relationships will end up happy    also as someone who has been victim of such a relationship before and been kept as that backup gf even though my bf had feelings for that other person let me tell you that youll destroy your bf even more the longer you keep that secret from him its time to have that talk anon or live with that feeling that eventually you emotionally destroyed everyone involved
  the way they greet you when you go into the store was kinda awkward for me at first but now i appreciate it the only thing i dont like about customer service in japan is how inflexible it is but otherwise the little things they do for you is really nice
  downgrade was a harsh choice of word and i mispoke on that what i meant was my sort of life stability would take a downgrade i wouldnt live with this other person and the general safety built up would be gone not to mention there is a physical distance between us not that the person himself is any sort of downgrade    but i will say theres no secrets here at all ive known my friend longer than my partner and he moved in on me when i was still in a relationship and he was fully aware i told him to back off twice and i just let my emotions get the best of me and let him act as he pleased as time went on ive told my boyfriend everything gave him a clear out if thats what he wanted and he said he wouldnt leave me no matter what happened theyre both sticking around of their own accord i tried to break it off with both and they just wont go but im at such a low point that i guess i dont want them to go anymore and i know that me not putting my foot down with a hard no to either was a big mistake that brought a lot of this on    but in the end yeah i fucked up if i could go back and change a lot then i would but i cant so here i am thanks for your opinion anon it is a lot to think about and i do appreciate it
  i honestly agree with the other anon as another person who was the girlfriend of some asshole with another girl that was an option its a shitty thing to do to someone it literally ruined me for so long not only is it devastating to your heart it fucks up your ability to trust even without all that emotional bullshit its a huge waste of time to be with someone who isnt faithful even if its not a physical unfaithfulness mental unfaithfulness is a huge waste of time too if youre seriously doing this you should just break it off with your boyfriend because apparently hes not for you in some way if he was you wouldnt be elsewhere please dont waste any more of his time
man i just really love cosplay
  you put your friend into position where they basically become a home wrecker shitty thing to do to someone you consider as best friend
ive always been a brand whore but im sick of this high with pastel blob dress trend  taobao and meta are the only places to get designs that havent been done to death already shat back out again on a sack dress muumuu  but if i buy taobao i cant flex on other girls in my comm by spending more money than they do  also taobao of course isnt nearly the same quality as brand but im just so bored
  its not all my assests lolita is not my main investment also who the fuck are you to assume everyone has at least 10k in their bank account     my parents only got up to that in their 30s and even then struggled    in b4 ppoorfag    like what millennial has a savings account over a few thousand mines for a car and i am just dyslexic and read the statement wrong
  hey whats more important flexing or having fun
  hardly he made every first move on me and was rejected twice but didnt quit im not in control of him i understand the role i played but in the end hes an adult making his own decisions
  then when he didnt listen to you you should have cut him out entirely
man i just really love being single
im going to a courthouse and getting married in a month and since its not a real ceremony i can justify wearing lolita to it i dont want to wear lolita to my actual wedding but knowing i get to for one of the most impactful decisions of my life makes me feel warm inside im going to cherish that dress forever
  are u me i couldnt give two shits about most of the stuff japanese brands come out with anymore at least not the ones that ship overseas but ive been falling hard for a lot of chinese brands i dont even care if the quality isnt as good as brand and to be entirely honest some brand just isnt worth it     i bought a new ap jsk recently wanted to treat myself because i rarely buy brand new and it was the first time in a long time id really loved something they released the dress horror candy shop cost me something like 330 before shipping and it feels so thin and flimsy that i nearly cried when i felt it sure it looks gorgeous and while the quality is better than any taobao brand ive owned the difference is not as big as it should be for the price difference     i dont care about flexing on anyone for owning more burando im so much happier with my wardrobe now that im adding chinese brand pieces because i dont have the same fucking dress that ive seen 100 times on cof
  youre right about that i was at fault there
  id say its a mutual thing he should respect your decision and you should respect your relationship by not creating one with someone else
  f i could go back and change a lot then i would  no you wouldnt if you did then you would change things now but the truth is you like how both of their /attention/ feels without caring about about how they feel
i hate when bodyline has a sale because all of a sudden there are like 50000 listings for overpriced bodyline on lm no one wants to spend 50 dollars on bodyline
its so weird and confusing seeing posts about bodyline on here i associate that word with the brutal style of cricket the english used to beat donald bradman more than anything else
  just buy those expensive 1500 mto dresses
  i wouldnt reproduce if i were you
my antarcticite cosplay shrunk in the wash  now its too antarctitight
  this makes me sad
today has been a good day so good that im in tears while in bed i want to tell everyone who made my day great that i love them that they make my life worth living and all that stuff but i just cant do it its too cheesy and makes me seem more depressed than id ever like to portray myself    so here i am shouting out my feelings into the void of 4chan im so grateful to be alive thank you
who am i and what am i doing with my life
tfw this jacket sold out in this colorway just days before i got paid  tfw sheglit never restocks their damn items    i wanted this dammit
  perhaps try learning to budget so this doesnt happen again
  good thing children are the literal spawn of satan and would be the worst investment i could ever make
  like what millennial has a savings account over a few thousand  me if i only have 10k in the bank i consider myself out of money
tfw no bf  how do you find men who actually want a relationship and marriage and arent just looking for a quick fugg     anon takoyaki is literally fried calimari balls its not rocket science to make your own i make my own tempura and its godly and better than paying 25 for 3 fried shrimp and a few lumps of whatever veggies they had on hand japanese food is criminally overpriced for such simple shit  i need to stop being lazy and make dango its so superior to mochi but i can find tons of mochi and zero dango bullshit     thats pretty harsh anon entry level wages are shit and barely cover living expenses so if anon hasnt been working for 35 years or longer of course shes probably poorfag   and saying that i do happen to have 10k liquid but stop poorshaming not all of us have sugar daddies to pay our rent
  np anon just stop eating for a week or two  lost weight   jeans were too baggy to wear  put jeans in dryer  came out perfect size
  glad you had a silver spoon born up yr ass or had really good connections because im just now crawling myself out of the hole my family was in when i left the house and have been slowly building a small wardrobe that helps me cope with the fact i struggle to keep living and am attempting to save what money i have leftover from working my ass off im very happy you are stable and have that but not everyone is and its not due to irresponsibility when i thought i was less than i should have been my instinct was to sell the priciest things i have and thats my wardrobe thats much better than keeping it and suffering without money for a vehicle or rent or food and i only need a car in very okay on rent and food       thank you anon i appreciate you i only make 12 an hour in a kitchen so saving can be a little bit of a bitch and takes a very long time to acquire anything unless im working 70 hours a week i wish i had access to a nice savings account having to worry about whether or not i need to sell my wardrobe with one slip up or an emergency expense is very unsettling and makes me pretty sad
  men who actually want a relationship and marriage and arent just looking for a quick fugg  hello
      fuck off    wont post bulge   keeps teasing   you fuck off too but not really
  tfw no 4chan bf to take his disgusting fetishes out on me    quads confirm post the bulge    get a better job honestly if you can string two sentences together youre better than 12/hr i used to think 14/hr was big money now i make 22 and i still feel underpaid just keep working and you can claw your way up
  calimari  do you not know what tako means
  octopus you fucking nitpicking nigger  its close enough you can find squid in grocery stores probably not octopus and really its the same shit
  go order contact lens today  it seems my account was hacked  and this is why you dont log in using your boomer parentss computer
  disgusting fetishes  oh  tfw you just want to be wholesome but everyone expects you to be a deviant because this is 4chan
  tfw no vanilla bf
too /cgl/ for /fa/  too /fa/ for /cgl/  tfw  i wish /fa/ had at least one decent female general other than /thinspo/ or /cgl/ had one for more mainstream styling
  i wish i could i have some chronic illnesses that prevent me from being able to work to my full extent and i guess i undersell myself a lot because i was making 825 an hour for my first three real jobs and because i was slow and continue to struggle a bit it feels like i cant get anything better i do want to pick up a secondary job but i dont know if i could even handle it with my illnesses
  how many thousands of miles are you from seattle
  same i dont lolita or cosplay i just like how stylish japanese in general are and more general things like the soft feminine styles cute tights cute bowties and such etc also nanchatte isnt /fa/ just a bunch of literal fags dressing up for daddies on grindr
  i actually want to move there and intend to do so as soon as i arrange things are you serious aare you qt
  i cant say whether or not ill be you bf here and now but ill absolutely get a beer or whatever with you and see what happens  do you have a time frame for arranging things  aare you qt  youll have to find out
  no it isnt octopus is much more difficult and time consuming to cook
if you chiseled a small hole in between a gems legs do you think theyd still be able to walk and fight and stuff asking for a friend of course
  stop shaving gems bald what are you doing you madman
  that would be kind of fun  within the next few months hopefully but theres a lot of stuff to be done just continue posting here
  i wont be going anywhere hopefully  you could also find me in the sakuracon discord and then you wont have to worry about sifting through hundreds of anonymous posts to find the one that looks like something id write    youre not actually moving to seattle right youre going to live in a different town and commute to seattle for work right
  can you not shit up this thread with your nonsense about living in a proper city
  who said anything about a proper city seattles just ridiculously expensive and choosing to live there instead of one of the many surrounding suburbs is financial suicide
  vanilla  male  pick one only one the only universality between men no matter their age race orientation hobbies is that every last one of them is a raging pervert whether overt or hidden and any guy who says otherwise is just lying to get a gf
  everyone knows its more expensive to live in the city proper than the suburbs but for some people the convenience and not having to commute for 3060 minutes is worth it you dont need to go on about it again
  if you cant afford a fancy jacket before pay day then you cant afford it after pay day
      gulls with instinctively agree with this fat fuck
i had to put my cat to sleep today    ive never experienced such loss and such hurt before
  sorry for your loss anon
  its always hard having to say goodbye to a pet was it old age
im finally going to tokyo guys ive wanted to do this since i was 13 and now im going to shibuya and harajuku and ive saved up all my money and im getting on the plane tomorrow morning im so excited
  sorry anon i feel your pain  get well soon
    thank you for your kind words      he was almost 16 and he was big boy just in the sheer size of his frame so he was never going to live as long as a smaller cat it was time for him to go he couldnt live the life a cat should but its my first time ever dealing with death it is very hard    his last food was some milk which he loved
  yeah i know what thats like i had to put my dog down when she was about 20 because she was blind deaf couldnt walk anymore and had an infection that wouldnt go away sometimes the best choice is to let them go because theres no way to get better from there    youre probably gonna hurt for a while but try focusing on how good it was when he was alive youll make it through this
  couldnt have said it better myself theres no room for someone elses love in a heart thats loyal to their s/o
  falling in love with someone else isnt something that happens by accident there were many opportunities where you realized it was wrong but continued on anyway youve broken the trust of the person whom youre supposed to be loyal to and your guilt is proof
  this post is sweeter than honey have a wonderful ceremony anon and post your coord
  im so grateful to be alive  those words are so good to hear tell your friends though it doesnt have to be mushy but just say thanks for doing this with me today i had a great time youve seen the positive impact its had on you and you dont know what your friends are going through behind closed doors your simple thank you could give them the same overflowingwithlove reaction that youre having now i hope you get to feel this way over and over again anon
  im sorry to hear that anon i unfortunately known your pain know that you did the best thing you could for them theyre living a painfree life that they otherwise wouldnt have without you you gave them the best exit from this life itll get easier hold their memory close and take it easy on yourself as someone whose lost family and a beloved pet very recently i can honestly say that the amount of grief is the same rest easy anon
man i just really wish they would send me my damn coat already its starting to get chilly here
ah
  maybe theyre cosplaying for some event dont be a dick
  you misunderstand my desire to be a parent grows ever larger
  ccute
does anyone else get kinda concerned when they actually start to add up how much they spend on cosplay i mean everyone has hobbies but i still feel like maybe im wasting my money even when im frugal and budget a lot its not like im new to this ive been doing it for years and i know how things cost but i dont know is it silly to spend so much on dressing like japanese cartoon characters
  if it brings you happiness
    
  its so gorgeous whens the release date anon i hope you get it soon
  midlate november so hopefully any day now i already bought matching earmuffs and im so excited
  this really i dont drive and want to be a convenient location cheap rent can be found especially in a share all those unwashed hipster baristas living on part time tip wages have to be living somewhere     congrats whats your cost estimate for the whole trip and how long are you going man that would be nice    rip catto
  this is stupid why does he need to bring down others to feel better about himself  i agreed with him until he started calling the fit guy boring
  i appreciate you anon
  its cope modern men are such trash well i guess modern hogwomen are trash too so they deserve each other   no one says you have to look like adonis but at the very least go on a cut until you stop having fucking manboobs skinnyfat is fine i dont know how people are even fat like nigga just close the fridge nigga stop eating
  thank you anon ive just been curled up in a corner listening to sad music and crying my eyes out i dont really have friends and i dont have much family so its been very lonely dealing with this    he lived with my parents for the past few months i noticed he was becoming matted because he wasnt grooming himself anymore he was beginning to urinate on himself he was also becoming deaf and they said he wouldnt come out from under the bed not to eat or drink or use the bathroom for three days which is common for cats when they know they are dying or seriously ill they just want to be somewhere dark quiet and safe when i got there and he saw me he actually came out which he hadnt done for anyone and crawled into my lap and just purred    im really happy that the last few hours of his life were spent with me and that he felt safe and comfortable    a message to everyone hold your pets tight give them a kiss and make sure they know that they are loved
  i think the biggest issue here is that he almost presents it as if the only alternative to being fit is being a fat lardo most people are justwellaverage being fat is a culmination of poor lifestyle choices not the default standard he doesnt have to hit the gm if he wants to get rid of his gut he has to put the fork down
  sending hugs your way losing a pet is always hard its clear that he loved you a lot
  thank you
be a father figure for most since teens  keep on aging and still being like a dad to most people even those im interested in romantically  no ones ever interested in the person beyond a parental figure    i could use to be more interesting
  plenty of people are into daddy play tho
the canada post strike has made it so that japan post wont ship to canada until further notice    just in time for christmas/lucky pack season
  we need to bomb the parliament building like srs
  just use a private courier added bonus that youll get your stuff faster
  how would that help
  or instead of bitching use dhl its almost like you dont have to use canada post
  same way it helped hitler when he bombed the reichstag
    just use dhl  pay hundreds of dollars more in customs fees  i mean its an option but its a real shitty one
  not asking your ss to mark down your package
  be trying to compete in cosplay contest in december  order fabric for it in late october  had to wait three weeks for it to be delivered after paying a pretty penny for ems because fucking post  wig just barely doesnt make the post cutoff and i need to pay more for dhl
  implying that makes a difference to what bullshit dhl will charge  i once got charged 50 in fees on a dress marked as 60
gulls how do you increase your libido  i feel empty devoid of desire since almost 8 months now my bf understand and is holding on but i feel like hes getting slowly irritated of the situation  what can i do its terrible i feel stuck
  are you an idiot mark it below the taxeable limit and dhl cant charge anything no wonder if you cant even read up on how customsduties work then you deserve those bullshit fees
  diet and exercise usually help a lot with that
  what can i do  let him fuck someone who has a functioning libido
  yeah let me just go back a month in time and reorder my package with dhl
  if you ordered a month ago youll still get your package the stuff i ordered a few weeks ago came as normal so
  cant you talk to a doctor about this it could be a medical issue  or ofc you just dont find your partner sexually desirable in which case gtfo
i hope everyone has a great day
  you just dont find your partner sexually desirable  surely this is most couples though
tfw no lolita gf whos crafty like ice is col  do i need to pay my dues playing the blues
  how the fuck is this /cgl/ related feels threads were a mistake
  its bait you ignore it
  not admiring his face and call him handsome in public  not admiring his smile when you call him handsome in private  not shivering in joy as you hold him close  not getting distracted when you see his body from a new angle  not shamelessly asking him to stay that way while you take it in  not tracing his skin with your fingers and feeling familiar with the placement of his scars and birthmarks  not holding and exploring his hands thinking about where theyve been  not being sexually attracted to your bf    i call myself a hopeless romantic but your outlook just looks hopeless for reference ive been with my bf for three years and hes still hot
  that series of pics is a favorite among fat person hate threads on /fit/ clearly a crossboarder
  may you as well
  if ops pic my come true one day  i might be the loser who bought her in the first place
  im not that person im making a general comment on how ugly most couples are i cant imagine many of those people are actually attracted to each other
  ugh this is me i get not being 100 in love or emotionally devoted to your partner no one can be 100 of the time but damn lets face it anons no one teaches you how to love properly or be loved and many people just jump with whoever doesnt dump them and end up being sexually/emotionally/etc unsatisfied     i adore my bf love slapping his cute little butt and compliment him often as he suffers from bdd he seems to have gotten better therefore making him a better partner
  hot dang im missing out on life
  anon you came to the wrong board for sexual advice im going to give it to you as someone mature a lot people think if youre not wanting to have sex its because youre not moved by your partner this is only true 2040 of the time     i want you to take sometime and find out what sexually stimulates you watch porn straight or even f/f masturbate not just slapping the clit use toys lubes go in front of the mirror and tell yourself that you love and approve of yourself hell call yourself a sexual goddess dress in sexy clothes for yourself turn yourself on first     then once you can achieve orgasm through masturbation be aroused by the thought of your man talk to him about your needs do you really enjoy kissing/foreplay and hes just not doing it do you like to suck his cock but hes dirty and thats off putting talk dont just tell him no and then start off slowly do oral foreplay making out dont have to get straight into it     in between that think about the last time you had sex with passion with want was there a traumatic experience that kept you from wanting to do it are you ensure of your gender/sexuality or is your partner being too soft/aggressive and wont let you bring it up     finally have sex and orgasm or at least get the point where you can also try anal
  thanks based fellow diamondposters
  me and im   im also fortunate enough to have a highly marketable skillset that i worked hard for with multiple graduate degrees to prove it you should still definitely think about your budgeting strategy though i was able to build savings even as a 30k a year grad student lolita also doesnt sell that quickly
  i dont drive and want to be in a convenient location  thats fair i hope your move goes well
  alright ill take your word for it
  i think they are at some level i dated someone fat and was genuinely aroused by him it just turned into less of the big picture but latching on to the fine details which made him so hot and beautiful to me because of my hyped up lovehormones we fell out of love for many reasons but one of them was that my sex drive was greater than his i dont think all fat people are hot but he was      slapping boy butts bring me joy and im not even particularly into butts if i may be so bold give your mans chest and nipples a loving squeeze in spirit of me      its out there i believe in you
  this is me with my bf god hes so hot were coming on 3 years as well and i never forget to tell him how handsome he is or how much i love him or let him know that i admire so much about him if there is ever anything he is unsure of or insecure about that i love i love telling him how attractive it is or how much i love it love is so important    i feel that my love has helped him to grow as a person as well i honestly dont understand how people can be with someone they dont adore
  tfw youll never be that guy
  i have a few pieces i know that would sell if i really needed to but youre right i also have a decent skill set but bc im sickly keeping up is very hit or miss for me im only 22 and i know ill be able to properly save and will be better in the future but right now sucks
  you have plenty of time at 22 sorry if it came off as insensitive i think a good first step might be to find a place with halfway decent health insurance to start getting your chronic disorders to a state where you can better manage im sure a lot of the folks gawking are mid im 25 to late 20s at least but as long as you keep moving forward youll get there  i remember what it was like to have a small dress collection keeping me happy from an exceptionally shitty time i believe in you anon
  i hope so im pretty hopeless when it comes to romance though who knows maybe having some remaining innocence is actually helpful i dunno
  tfw ill never be that guy because all of the women i tend to be interested in turn out to be complete psychos with emotional baggage
  thank you anon i appreciate it i have insurance but my doctors office is 20 minutes away and like i said im without a car atm and my doctors skirt around my issues because the main medication i need is 1500 for a single months supply and my insurance wont cover it because of how high it is eventually i will have a better job that has better insurance but for now i gotta suffer     thank you again anon i appreciate you a lot and thank you for rooting for me it means a lot to me im happy i dont have to sell my wardrobe and im extremely happy to be a part of a community of girls who are supportive of each other in times of need i love you all
  another chronically ill anon here and i know the struggle i hope you find a medication that works for you and a doctor that understands your issues
    finding a doctor that understands is at least half of the battle it isnt entirely the same thing but it took my old doctor retiring and finding a new one to finally get my anxiety/ptsd fully under control
  go to a doctor it might be hormone issues it might be depression theres a lot medical/psychological reasons for this
  its meant to smoke out fattychans
  feels threads are this boards containment threads windowlickerchan that much shouldve been obvious
  mfw horny multiple times a day masturbate daily fuck randoms on top of my fuckbuddy constantly horny at work horny when i wake up horny when i go to bed constantly horny  guys call me a nympho always cum like crazy during sex  become a cuckqueen and give me your bfs address so i can give him the love he deserves youre meant for it sweetie     do it faggot oklahoma city that bitch up
  losing focus when he takes off his shirt or his shorts and you have to struggle to follow what hes saying often asking him to repeat himself    a fucking mood and weve been together for 5 years going on to 6
  are you on any kind of medication sometimes thats a side effect all in all i agree with the other anons a doctor is necessary here
  tfw i used to be just like that    im happy that im in a committed monogamous relationship with a guy who is just as debauced as i am and can satisfy my raging nymphomania i look back on my slutty days and cringe big time
  not that anon but most everyone has emotional baggage probably even you too which is why you cant get a woman and are attracted to the ones who are vulnerable
      fine ill heed your advice and check with a doc thanks      thanks for the advices ill try that by to be frank i never liked porn theres simply no interest for me i dont see the point do you think watching some with my partner could help i feel like its awkward    also i dont masturbate i kinda disgust myself i dont really want that it is really necessary       you sounds like you are a male larping can a woman be really that sexually active
  i would prefer monogamy desu but if i dont get regular dick ill go insane 1 month is my limit and then im on tinder for a quickie   i dont have any diseases or love children so whats the problem  tfw no bf    can a woman be really that sexually active  im sorry youve never experienced it
  cmon anon you cant say that and not share some stuff give us some crunchy stories
  london
  yeah that anon does honestly sound like a larper or a super faggot but im a woman with an abnormally high libido and i used to do that kind of shit with multiple dudes i settled down with someone but still have the sex drive of a teenage boy
i wish i could have sex too
  it was always like that or it is something you cultivated  i feel like im missing on these good things of life but i have no desire its very frustrating
  it was always like that i am ashamed to admit it but i was experimental in my childhood not really sure what triggered it but my drive is at a constant 11 out of 10 the only time im ever not craving sex is after working a 12 hour shift in the manufacturing plant i work at and even then its pretty easy to turn me on     and it happens anon not everyone wants to do it if you really do want to have sex and there is something preventing that then like other anons have said a doctor is your best bet there is also that possibility that youre just asexual
  which is why you cant get a woman  how do you think i come to learn theyre actually psychotic you retard i get in relationships with them
  following yalls conversation has now reminded me of some of the terrible sexually formative experiences of my adolescence and childhood
  containment   theres obvious posts by crossboarders in almost every thread  okay rpkun
  like what
  muh crossboarders  conveniently ignoring the fact the the threads already full of completely offtopic shit not related to /cgl/ in any way the way every feels thread is including to not limited to people  talking about their shitty relationship and wanting to run off with their friend  talking about their cat being dead  talking about their fetishes  talking about their libido  seriously licking windows clearly isnt good for you
  neighborhood girl taking me into her room and flashing me when i was like 5 or 6 tried to tell both of our moms when it happened but got in trouble instead  a few years later other neighborhood girls hold me down so the same girl can forcibly kiss me  repeatedly told the girl i lost my virginity to no and pushed her off if me several times i ended up going along with it because i saw no other way to get out of the situation  mom dumped her own issues with men onto me still does sometimes when were together
  nayrt but greater london sure
  damn  sorry to read that anon at least you seem to have transformed that into something positive for you right now
  you sounds like you are a male larping can a woman be really that sexually active    anon you sound like you may have the typical american sex is something done to a woman to be tolerated and not enjoyed mindset ive found that a lot of women who have had that drilled into their head dont enjoy sex even when they want to
  malefags get an entire board aregaynine to feelspost in  femfags get one thread one one femalecentric very slow board to share their feels  we get bitched at
  how many randoms are we talking here
  rip feels thread romance is still alive edition   the gender debate has arrived a hundred posts too early
  no i really havent progress had been stalled for months what ive been feeling the past 40 minutes did make me realize that ptsd diagnosis was right on the money though
tfw you live in the south and want to hang around people with similar interests but theyre always the worst kind of weeb possible and theres no one else for miles upon miles    help i just wanna have fun
  maybe if your eyes werent so black cold and dead youd be able to have fun with the weebs
  just a couple dozen so far i try to use the same guy for a while to reduce std chances   still rather have a bf/husband but you know
  i can be your bf as long as youre got some depraved fetishes i can work with on top of being a nympho
  i cant help the way i was born anon id rather not be around when they unironically recite quotes from the shadow the hedge hog/ sasuke slow burn slash fic if that makes em happy more power to em
  nayrt but last week a customer said to me you have pretty eyes like a shark   mfw my eyes are blue
          why are straight gulls always so gross
  go into feels thread hoping its not that bad  op is dumb but at least its somewhat animu/weeb shit  first few posts whatever  notice multireply comic that is completely off topic  immediately know the thread is going to be shit after that  i latched onto the first thing i saw and what about it  to keep on thread  moitie releases jewelry again   its still ugly  why cant they make actual cute looking jewelry
  fuck off dyke
  lmao not straight but ok anon sorry to hear that your sex life is so vanilla and boring
  the typical american sex is something done to a woman to be tolerated and not enjoyed mindset  not her but americans are very sexually depraved at least since the 70s/80s i kind of wish they had that mindset tbh
  lmao why
  bifag  even worse also  implying vanilla and boring is bad  implying risks pain and drama are better
  since were already off topic as is tradition ill bring us back to romance    lonely sadsack after another drawnout relationship with a loser who dumped me but kept me around for a year  go to a houseparty with my friend never met anyone else there  one guy in particular both kinda think the other is pretentious and seems to be zero interest between us  accidentally get wasted fall out of a 140 uber i paid for us to go out vomit on my shoes the whole shebang  im going out to get sad drunk that weekend say so in my sc story  that one guy from the party messages and asks if i want to go out with him and his friends so i wont be so sad/lonely  were drunk and crammed into an uber heading into the city he turns around and says as soon as we get out im gonna try to make out with you is that okay  he does  turns out i left my id at his friends house so the two of us uber all the way back to get it and back out again  we both end up taking monday off of work/uni and stay at his friends house for four straight days just talking and hanging out together    tldr is that weve been together every single day since and effectively live together now    the last guy for reference dumped me because i was too quiet and that was embarrassing for him but he still strung me along for a year  ive never been as happy and comfortable and outgoing as i am now with this fucking angel of a young man and meeting him was a complete accident
man this thread is just reminds me of tfw no gf
  whew its really hard to tell this story properly in a concise way    basically we had no interest in each other whatsoever from the first party and he invited me out with his friends specifically because he wanted me to get drunk and do something stupid/entertaining again then we realized that were perfect together oops
  hoo shit tell him anon can take his victorian era women hate sex mindset back to his mommys basement with him  sex is like a massage but better and free dildos wouldnt be a billion dollar industry if women didnt enjoy dick
  140 uber  what the fuck also anon learn to hold your liquor and not forget your fucking id how do you even do that even drunk me doesnt do that i mean great you got a guy to fugg you but sort your shit out and seriously wtf last lyft i got was like 4
  in my defense my wallet had recently broken so i was carrying my cards loose i just grabbed my bank card instead of my id as we were leaving the house    also  australian uber
  not that anon but i just wish more people were ethical about sex you wanna fuck random guys sure go ahead just dont act like youre into monogamy and only want to have sex with your partner while sleeping around because one dick isnt enough at least have the courage and decency to be honest about yourself
  how so anon just because some people are bisexual doesnt mean they are predisposed to cheat
  or sleep around forgot to add that to the sentence
  cosplay is inherently a hobby that screams give me attention thats why there are so many girls and gays attracted to it  t gay
  seconding someone can be the biggest slut when theyre single and wholeheartedly monogamous while theyre in a relationship the two modes arent mutually exclusive
crying cause my disney cos crew has no time to see wreck it ralph 2 with me
  i doubt that i havent met a single slut who could stay committed to a monogamous relationship they always end up cheating and crying about how they didnt mean to and it was an accident its not their fault they have no self control
tfw no lolita gf to dress in lolita w me and have lots of fucked up sex with     iim not sad you are
    theyre predisposed to spreading diseases on innocent people and having mental illnesses/disorders
  anecdote  yeah but its not the norm you fucking retard
  lol if you seriously dont check for stds before sleeping with anyone you most definitely deserve to get them
  australian uber  guess it must be all that dropbear insurance    ive never cheated on anyone you salty bitch
  good for you now if only you werent the vocal minority of promiscuous people
  how do you even know who other people are fucking or not fucking go back to /r9k/ and stay go
            stereotypes exist for a reason and the other anon is right youre all in a minority the majority of sluts arent like you youre no different from the guys who go not all men 11
i bought chocolate croissants and my dad ate all of them kind of bummed
my friends sister is only 12 and shes already getting thot patrolled at cons
  sstereotypes exist for a reason  doesnt mean they are correct retard the vast majority of bisexuals are not cheaters or sluts thats like saying all men are cheaters and sluts because some cheat and some sleep around with multiple men or women you sound like you have a hate boner for bisexuals lemme guess a bi gal broke your heart its okay anon she cant hurt you anymore
  god has truly nerfed your peewee mind huh
  thats like saying all men are cheaters and sluts because some cheat and some sleep around with multiple men or women  men actually do cheat more than women though this has been proven a countless number of times that doesnt mean literally all of them do it just that theyre more likely to when compared to women or is it merely a coincidence that most sexual crimes are committed by men  you sound like you have a hate boner for bisexuals  no just sluts in general
  i hate sluts  why though they literally dont affect your life in anyway lol
  get him back by stealing his credit card and blowing it all on coords and dresses
  if it has the potential to affect society then yes it does affect me almost everything a person does has an effect even if you dont see it right away theres already enough distrust between men and women promiscuous behavior worsens that and makes it harder for people to form meaningful relationships but shouldnt your doesnt affect you logic apply here too why care about people shitting on sluts then
also  openly talks about sex life  makes it everyones business  reeeeeeeeee dont judge me/ its none of your business/ it doesnt concern you1
tfw lonely
  iif a slut affects society it affects my life  except when does it ever come to that magnitude that is some serious mental gymnastics just say you have no legitimate reason to hate on sluts anon     keep reeeeeing sweaty
  tfw same
serious question for the sluts here how do you distinguish between who you want a casual fling or an actual relationship with
  except when does it ever come to that magnitude  see    theres already enough distrust between men and women promiscuous behavior worsens that and makes it harder for people to form meaningful relationships  what if someone wants a meaningful wholesome relationship without any divorce zero chances of diseasesetc what if someone wants to raise a family now theyre screwed because slutty behavior is normalized and no one wants to commit no one is capable of forming bonds anymore so you end up with kids raised by a single parent which usually results in the kid becoming a criminal or having an increased chance of mental disorders mommy/daddy issues etc or people dying old and alone with nothing left behind youre deluded if you think everything in life doesnt have a cause and effect point a leads to point b and so on
  this thinlyveiled incel rhetoric is embarrassing
  only incels want a real relationship  only incels want a healthy functioning society  youre part of the problem
  youre not answering the question on how it personally affects you sluts have been around since the dawn of time and society has not come to your delusional hypothetical and it never will stay mad incelkun
  how many people someones slept with has nothing to do with whether or not they currently want to be in a committed relationship nor does it have anything to do with how society functions as a whole
  youre not answering the question on how it personally affects you  it makes it harder for me to trust others and easier to run into damaged broken people  sluts have been around since the dawn of time  but they werent normalized or accepted in the past people were free to judge and dislike them back then  society has not come to your delusional hypothetical  divorce rates arent high  single parents arent common  mental illnesses havent increased  noncommitted relationships havent increased  cheating hasnt increased  are you living under a rock even other female anons in these threads have pointed out how difficult it is to find a serious relationship with someone because all guys care about is sex
i just want to scissor why dont girls understand
i hate sluts because we live in a society
      you cant argue with trips and dubs desu
i just want someone to hug who sees me as a real person with feelings and not a sex object
  is it supposed to be cute i feel sorry for glasses guy he definitely should make a cashback as it was obviously defected
nyannyanncosplay is a thot
   2018   still objectification complaining  cmon get something new to attract attention
  cant i see you as all of those things what matters is that we feel good with one another and can help each other out    oh no im having a fictional romance with a random gull inside my head now thats sad
  people are not objects anon
  tell that to my ex and all of my former friends
  if you care about your partner feeling good too and want to help them out youre not treating them like an object    i mean relationships like my ex treating me as a living dildo only caring about me as far as my sexual performance and always comparing my dick to other guys as if thats the only part of me that mattered expecting me to feel flattered that she chose me because she thinks i had the best dick
  its like we know the same girl this is disturbing
tfw americans go to sleep and youre all alone in the feels thread
  also i dont masturbate i kinda disgust myself  if youre unable to even touch yourself youre not going to enjoy when someone else does it to you masturbating is a healthy part of engaging with our bodies that helps one understand their preferences i think its important for everyone to take part in  even if the end goal isnt sexual gratification you need to know your body to know when its feeling / looking / smelling abnormal from reading your post i get the feeling that your problem is either medicinal or an issue with body image that may be a hurdle you need to leap in order to face this problem
  nyart but people have different levels of libido one persons sex drive is going to be different from the next typically its something that you grow into with puberty and it changes somewhat over time but i dont think thats your problem in this case
  im glad that getting it off your chest has been therapeutic anon dont berate yourself though youre not stalling youre at the crossroads of the next path youre going to travel i hope you do seek therapy or continue to do so if you already are what happened to you was not okay and id be more inclined to label it as rape i hope that things work out well for you in the end
  thot patrolled  ive never heard of that before as in people are coming up to her and calling her a thot or shes going around and calling people thots
tfw accidentally post your feel in a dead thread  tfw never had romantic experiences/gf ever  tfw hope to make contacts at cons  never do  tfw too dense to understand when people are interested until hours later when its too late  heck ive even had girls straight up tell me they want me and i just laugh it off and hurt them in the process
    male sluts are just fine and dandy  female sluts are the apocalypse itself  wooooooow my almonds are going jogging
  male sluts are just fine and dandy  where was this said
  men and women are different and therefore there are different expectations of them    stop the presses    also most guys are pretty split on the issue of man whores some think its great some think its gross
  to be fair there are seven 7 feels threads up
send a song to a friend  decide to come back to it later  lyrics all about love  i just thought it sounded nice
i dont even remember how to write here been so long gone from lolita but now im feeling overally better and just finding will to dress up again ive everything now what ive ever wanted two expensive hobbies loving fiance house of our own and stilli cant believe that ive achieved that all and cant believe i can combine my life with lolita anymore even i want and feel that it is my thing still but somehow it feels like it doesnt look like me anymore like i want to dress up and enjoy the fashion and i have motivation again to do that but somehow it doesnt feel like me anymore im confused
  maybe you need to find another substyle to wear instead of the one youve worn before many girls drift off from sweet to classic or gothic but some go from gothic or classic to sweet theres no rule to this just wear what makes you feel beautiful its very possible that your taste has changed so try things out again experiment and find what you like to wear in the fashion  and if you eventually realize that lolita in its entirety doesnt make you feel beautiful anymore and you dont want to wear it at all thats ok too you can continue to love it and not wear it yourself all that matters is that youre happy you know
  doesnt help that i dont frequent /cgl/ or other slow boards in general
  maybe youre right maybe i should try dressing up but differently surprise surprise ive been wearing sweet lolita and even it still pleases my eye it doesnt really feel like me anymore dressing differently than sweet lolita somehow scares me and feels weird like ive always dressed up like neon colored diabetes heart attack birthday cake how else i could be i just have to step one step outside of my narrow box and look differently thanks
  if you want to stick to sweet why not try wearing more dusky colours or florals rather than bright ap pastels
    all of you fucks would become a pussy slaying chad if you could and you idolize him chad is just a manslut a stacy with a penis stop being salty that other people get laid and you dont because you stupid ugly whores know if anyone wanted you youd be the biggest slut around   ive never heard any attractive man who regularly gets laid being critical of female slutting only ugly incels say this because youre saltier than the pacific ocean
  is it hard to find legit contact lenses ive always wanted to try the color contacts but im scared of putting sketchy chinese shit in my eyes
try to raid /r9k/ a la tumblr epic style  fail  surprised they come back for retribution a year later
  dude what
  its not hard to find however becaus its technically illegal for people without a prescription in the us theres always the underlying sketchiness
been trying to find a good ivory blouse with princess sleeves for a decent price for months  most of the ones i find have the arms made of lace  i have a huge tattoo on my upper arm that i want covered when i wear lolita  why does finding a good blouse have to be so fucking hard    also    read a post somewhere about how mean bitchy and awful all lolitas are  about to argue that its not really the case in my experience since im in a great comm among other things  quickly realize that i would rather have people think we are elitist cunts than risk making it an even bigger hugbox than what it has been turning into last few years  yes lolitas are mean nasties and its best to stay far away from them
  was there another tumblr raid what whats going on and why do you think this is relevant to cgl
  finding the right blouse is hard  ive been trying to find a simple brown blouse in the right shade and without any added white/black lace for so fucking long ugghhhh i feel u
  i vaguely recall iw releasing some princess sleeved blouses that werent sheer maybe look at what they have in stock and see if it might work for you   also definitely seconded that last point it is actually better for us that people think were bitchy and elitist because it keeps a lot of legitimate scumbags out or makes them leave quickly
  youve been missing the entire point of this discussion maybe its different for those anons youre replying to but im not interested in getting laid and im also not a man ive been shitting on both men and women the whole time and gave actual reasons for doing so which you couldve figured out if you were literate theres no reason for me to idolize chads or stacies because sex and hedonism isnt what i desire in the first place
  why not just get it removed
  its obviously a troll dont feed it
  been there before wew    sends a boy a cute song  this is how i feel about you  goes back to listen right after  it basically says i want to run away with you and i love you more than you can imagine  mfw
  because i really like my tattoo if you read my post properly you would see i dont want it visible when i wear lolita since it obviously doesnt fit with the aesthetic      they havent released any princess sleeved blouses in a while been checking their website weekly just in case and the one in the flat rate sale section is sold out in beigebut thanks anyway anon
    sending a song before you listen to it    
  maybe they cant understand spoken english/the language of the song
  many women mistake men who are better looking than them looking to fuck an easy girl as being in their league then disregard anyone actually in their league because they think they can do better
    sharing music with now ex bf  send him a song by mili that i think is nice   seconds later remember that its a song about how all men are trash   didnt get a text back   lmao
  whats your tattoo of
  yeah the song i sent wasnt in english i saw the word love in the title/lyrics but i thought nothing of it at the time
  i did read it properly i just didnt imagine anyone would actually like their tattoos
  hurr anon must be ugly  nigga please im the cutest thing to ever grace gods earth go get notfucked with your designated cum sock
  yeah right people love getting horrible things they dislike and abhor on their skin forever
happy thanksgiving everyone
  ah i see why you have difficulty finding someone who wants more than sex
  i figure they didnt realize how horrible they were at the time they had it done
  gross
black friday  a bit racist innit

  youre thinking of blacked friday
  thanksgiving was last month tho
  most of the time doctors are less than useless theyre good if you have a broken arm but if its a vague not feeling well theyll do more harm than good just have her eat a healthier diet go on walks and get good sleep that fixes 90 of problems
  why does she hate doctors once you find the answer to that problem youll have a better chance at convincing her to get professional help i would not put your gfs wellbeing in the hands of anons no offense gulls
  wow this is unfunny
  anon with the tattoo from earlier here personally i usually tell people that if they want a specific tattoo they should keep it in mind for at least 12 years and if they are still dead set on the tattoo then as they were the day they thought of it then maybe they should go ahead    personally i got mine when i was 19 but i have wanted one since i was like 56 because my babysitter would bring me to tattoo parlors when she would get new ones which really left an amazed impression on me and my brother that was 13 years older than me got a lot of tattoos at the time as well while its not symbolic uwu and i agree that maybe it was childish of me to follow the dreams of a baby but it was something that had been such an important goal for me all my life  im 28 soon and i still love it luckily i dont even think about it most of the time it might as well just be a huge weird birthmark that i can easily cover up with a tshirt or a jacket when needed because im so used to it being there hell im even considering getting another smaller one on my back     thanks for reading my blogpost
  i say ive been stalling because i havnt been working at it i havent seen my therapist in weeks im pretty much only in the library gym or bed these days truth is i think im scared to move on
  im australian i havent said the words shiela or barbie unironically ever    koalas smell like shit their sound is fucking gross and their fur feels like burnt carpet i hope we kill them all    cunt eh
    ive got 7 tattoos and will get more in time 5 of them were impulse as in i didnt really think about them for longer than a couple of days before getting them and so far i just started regretting one wrist tattoo that i got when i was 18 im 26 now but if anything it just motivates me to get a nicer cover up    i dont think there should be a required tattoo age past 18 tattoos dont have to be this super intentional meaningful thing they can be fun and if you regret them then get a coverup or laser or just dont get them but just because you happen to be afraid of getting something permanent doesnt mean you get to decide that for everyone else    thanks for coming to my ted talk
  i feel you i get tired of crying i get tired of connecting the dots in the therapists office sometimes its not that i do want to get better but its just so emotionally tasking and im so tired recovery isnt a race though its a marathon if you need to take a breather to be able to continue running then do so build the strength to move through your fear slowly
  where do you buy legit ones
  why the sell sex dolls with self consciousness  why they give sex dolls super human strenght  why theres still cops in a world with robots with super human strenght    this comic makes no sense
  came back to this thread after lurking last night just wanted to say that youre awesome and please keep this outlook as long as you can wish more people were like this lately i have been feeling like this ideology is a dying breed
where do i get a coat like this
or like this
previous thread 
      idk if anyone posted this but enjoy the cringe
  not even an actual lolita besides her piercings and makeup are the only fugly thing if she took them of and toned it down it would be fine that goth is a walking killstar advertisement thoughyeesh
  thats literally what she called herself she said she felt like she was the only lolita in the world
that poor cardigan
  armhair
  the arm hair doesnt bother me its the fact that shes a planet that cant fit into that dress or cardigan
  it was posted in the last thread  tldr of that discussion is she was portrayed in a bad light by the people who made the video she does actually wear lolita but didnt for this interview and yes her piercings are bad
  holy fucking arms also her head looks giant
      browsing her instagram was a mistake but at least she is self awarepic from insta related
  also for the last anon that was asking what schizoaffective is its a disorder thats like a combination of schizophrenia and a mood disorder like depression or bipolar try using google every now and again when you dont know what something is
  aw her head and her bag are the same shape
  try using google every now and again when you dont know what something is  or we just wait until you tell us
  does mommy need to spoon feed you your dinner too
  she looks like one of those reaction meme faces from several years ago weird face shoop isnt helping poor girl
  this would be cute if she wasnt a planet
  ageplayer or just owo meme
  yesplease
  is this a guy cause i have no idea how anyone is reading this as female
  desu it looks like they have a bad hormone imbalance
    scary how you can tell whos a tumblr retard just from looking at them
meta head to toe my ass i own that dress and this is 100 a replica
  actual jsk from meta for reference
    wtf the buildings arent even there
    im not a fan of the coord but it just looks like one of the lucky pack skirts they put out when they have extra fabric plus i dont believe this one was ever made as a replica i have a few meta lucky pack skirts and they often have this gold trim on the bottom too personally the boots raise my suspicions more also can you really call it meta headtotoe if the socks are offbrand
  it sits so wrong though its also short there was an official skirt that also had the buildings so unless its something exclusive to lucky packs its probably not meta     and yeah the boots and the socks are not brand sohead to knees head to waist what a mess
    nayrt but the shape could be due to a dodgy petticoat and the length could be because shes tall it does look like the luckypackspecific cut the ones that arent border prints always seem to have a second tier    to be honest with you ive no idea whats going on with her shape shes just kind of bulbous and ballooney under her clothes for some reason
        
    lol its a lp skirt they always do those with the leftover fabric theres a cute kimono print one on mercari right now
  this is old as fuck anon
  she is a minor lolcow as she lies in rc all the time it isnt a replica her only outfit is from the one time she actually bought from meta here is the same outfit from a year ago
  thatssad honestly
  ii dont understand how can somebodys head be so round like egg
  thats adorable
  if not for the arm hair she would be really cute in a cartoonish way
  stereotypical ita pose too
  i thouht the same color scheme and bunny ears are really cute cuter socks and 160 pounds less and it would be a really adorable bodyline coord
  shes actually a sphere
  her handle is literally fattychan and fattysama shes hella self aware couldnt care less
  wtf is wrong with her boobs
  looks like shes wearing a binder or somthing to squish them down she really should have lifted them under the binder though
this girl not only pollutes the lolita tag with her shit but her ig has loli gore/edgelord shit all over  i keep seeing her on my explore
  oooooooooh shit i saw a vid of her floating around on fb today shes that girl who made a huge fool of herself on her live
  her account is gross i dont get why some people have so many followers on instagram
  she also has a scat fetish
  source
    is this poop chan      is it the vid youre talking about someone in my feed shared it today  mistressanju/ posts/ 20276 1989 3924 888  remove all spaces
  yikes shes a cheap copy of toshi salvino
  that giant disgusting nose ring makes her look like a pig how fitting  also her boyfriend looks trashy as fuck once again how fitting
  i dont come to this shit hole you inbred mongrel clicked the wrong board and saw it
  omg dont eat me please
  whats with the gross makeup and piercing trend right now
  guys this girl literally had a crazy call out post like two days ago because she was saying some racist stuff and was chewed out about it and instead of being a normal person and fixing it she made an absolute fool of herself blocked by multiple artists for art theft and ive tried to trade items with her in the past and she never sent the items apparent this is a very common thing also her depop is full of cringe worthy pictures of shitty lolita and random melanie martinez inspired items on her boyfriend
  oh yes sorry to same fag but when she got called out instead of reacting like anyone else would and after she threw a hissy fit for being called out she literally started spamming her friends list and followers with private messages of her boyfriends shitty music project
  called out on what i missed it all
  look at the link i posted  add http facebook dot com in front and remove all spaces
  wait so poop chan is the girl from that cringy fb video
  whos going to be retarded enough to give money to dangerhairs
  looks like moot
  why would you ever consider trading items with someone so nasty are you nasty too
  nayrt but fat girls are definitely overrepresented in my local lolita comm vs the general population my country has less of an obesity problem than many other western countries yet 30 of my comm is obese i cant speak for the entire west but in my area it is kind of a fat girl fashion
  fat maybe its more associated with unattractive girls in japan like girls who arent cute without super cute clothes
  theyre all male were using female pronouns because cosplay mentality
i love that cosplay lolita is stuck in 2010
  desu these leg covering are worlds better than the pants they were wearing under their skirts last year
  are muslim girls not allowed to wear tights
  are those not pants they look like pants and they look like shit knee high boots would be infinitely better than whatever this is
  ok but why not  1tights  2knee high lolita boots  3 bloomers that reach down to the knee on top of tights  4profit
  they are but im assuming they either didnt have them or they genuinely preferred those
  wasnt this posted in the last thread
    it depends ive known girls who get yelled at for even asking about tights it comes down to the familys perspective of if the tights are too reminiscent of the anatomy of legs like its its simplest form its about covering skin but on a secondary level its about obscuring anatomy to hide the natural lines of the body see the white paints work because they are loose enough to hide wither or not the legs they cover have any kind of feminine shape overall i think this picture shows the girls are getting a better grasp on how to merge their interests and religion      terrible wig time out corner for you      shes got the idea and i bet in a year will look better
  it really depends as  said in some regions and cultures its acceptable for women to wear heavy makeup and bare underarms/calves with hijab in others theyre not even allowed to wear pants and have to wear loose floorlength garments that completely obscure their body shape these girls seem to be at a kind of middle ground
  middle one with the hello kitty plush would have actually looked decent if it werent for that harsh animu doll makeup
  yes
under the lolita fashion tag
  reach harder
  this is fine lol change the hair style and add better accessories
  probably the correct place for it tee bee aitch looks fine maybe could use a couple of accessories but certainly not offensive
  white trash
  this doesnt make senseanon
  replace weird with obese and we got a winner
  i think shes cute all she needs is better socks/shoes and maybe curl her hair with a higher hairstyle
  insert neck pun    seriously why the tutu the mini skirt the blue wig all of it is so bad its like an ita mix of fairy kei and bodyline
  what style is this supposed to be looks like a weird modern interpretation of ren faire garb
  gotta love bob
  looks like a halloween costume so free pass for looking bad
  all her coords look like this so no
   am i the only one who thinks they all look nice i mean look at the rest of this thread in comparison
  i think they all look great the one with the hello kitty doll could use some help imo that makeup is so bleh and the dress doesnt look very high quality imo but i love the girl in the bodyline coord on the left desu
  whats the point of this    isnt hijab supposed to be worn to show modesty and not bring attention to ones self
  you cant criticise that theyre empowering themselves /s
  i hate this either do it correctly or leave it      this genuinely frightens me
  its a cultural thing now more than a religion thing
  they cannot be serious with this how embarrassing
  my reaction to the original image
  eugh i hate the gore cute aesthetic
  sorry 4chan sent me angsty it was a cruel and heartless joke and im sorry i posted it
  it never comes off as genuine gore and its always always cringey
  i too think there is nothing much wrong with them most likely nitpick tier if anything someone is just racistchan
  wow how timely and culturally relevant
  i looks awful if you think otherwise you have no taste baggy pants underneath the dress wtf
  at least shes wearing bloomers
  miley cyrus kei
  apparently youre racist
  pants with lolita will always be ita
    isnt this a pic from like last year or a couple years ago
  2 is fine 1 and 4 are not completely awful 3 is terrible
        these girls are trying to enjoy the fashion to the best of their ability given their cultural restrictions hijab lolita is a thing we used to have a practicing muslim in our comm and im actually surprised that some malaysian or indian lolita dress brand hasnt popped up yet take your edgelord muslimhate to another thread besides shalwar kameez are designed to be worn under a dress or long tunic theyre not pants educate yourself before you sound like an idiot
  seething its ugly and they are itas
  its ugly but theyre not itas     they have a grasp of lolita but theyre limited by their religion
  i suggested a tights long bloomers and kneelength boot combo upthread why cant they do that  additionally the religion/culture argument is fucking bullshit at what point does it stop being lolita what if someone couldnt wear a petticoat or a blouse because of some strange religious practice but still had a jsk would it still be lolita   beleive it or not religion to most people in the world is a fucking choice so is the clothing they put on themselves if you put together a shitty combination like upthread pic people have every right to be put off by it
  religion is a choice for most people  bwahahahaha  what if some weird religion banned pettis  since lolita is mainly about a silhouette and these girls can accomplish said silhouette within their religion its still lolita their legwear may throw it off a little but not to the point that its unrecognizable as lolita honestly ive seen hijab lolita done better but these girls dont deserve to be here over legwear thats part of their culture
  religion is a choice for a good percent of people fucktard and if those pink itas upthread can spend hundres on pastel japanese dresses and actually wear them then yes its a choice i really dont care how people express themelves through their religion this isnt about that it doesnt change that as unfortunate as it is their religious practices dont translate well as a part of a fashion based on old european fashion what part of that dont you understand religion isnt an excuse any more than being autistic is if it looks bad it looks bad end of story   lolita is about a silhouette  youre absolutely right and being ita is about being painful to look at which those aweful pants absolutely are   they have a right to wear those pants and i have a right to think theyre fucking ugly
  i have a cultural dress that is made with the same silhouette and as lolita fashion the dress is kitchy and covered in contrasting bright colours i guess because its a cultural thing i can wear it with a btssb headbow and no one can say its ugly or not really lolita  thank you anon for opening my eyes i cant wait to go dressed up to my local com and dab on all the haters
  no its from this year
    i smell someone here having a vendetta now
      it wasnt posted last ita thread that i remember just a lot of dissent on it in the cof thread honestly i think    and   just need changes to the hair lose the utks and better accessories
  against what race itas
  oh fuck off you can dislike something aesthetically without hating muslims as a whole
    ita is ita bad looks is bad looks its that easy if it clashes with your beliefs tough luck get another hobby or do it anyway and look awful just goes to show that some beliefs/customs are limiting personal freedom and belong in the bin        this      cosplay lolitas are recognizable they still look like shit  you supporting this nonsense is you supporting girls limiting themselves and being limited to some regressive beliefs
  also its not like all muslim girls wear headscarfs im sure most muslim lolitas just dress normally because its not a revealing fashion
    reddits back that way
what does ita stand for
  in the ass
  it only makes it bigger
  the pants do ruin the silhouette though they should wear long length or tea length dresses and boots
  i wouldnt even mind the pants if they were fitted and not baggy and i dont mean a skinny fit either a straight cut would make miles of difference
alright gulls this actually got me thinking what do we want     lets answer this amino secret personally where were just as honest and anonymous as we want to
  whether youre a mudslime or whatever stupid religion that forbid you from showing knees because men are gonna cream their pants over uncovered legsit looks bad dresses with pants look terrible  also the big headbows on top of the hijabs makes them look like easter eggs its unflattering  i feel bad for those girls trapped in a religious freak country who just want to wear cute stuff       this
  id say apologize on said social media you did the dumb thing on and if anyone is being a bitch afterwardsdisregard them if you recognize you did wrong and apologized/made up for it anyone trying to start shit after that is just drama hungry  depends on the gravity of said thing toobut i do agree that gulls can be quick to rip someone apart and we can be ruthless
  the thing about this is that people on this board love to make something out of nothing and if they even think it bothers you theyll keep going until you either quit being in public view at all or kill yourself because itll never be enough for everyone   youll get people saying it was insincere shes still a cunt that wont make me stop hating her what a half asses apology etc   it wont stop until cgl and lolcow die which they wont because people love to call others out on things theyre guilty of themselves
  lmaoooo im dead i know this girl
  this desu
  yikes this is the girl who wore that tacky cdc replica to rufflecon nice to see she just always has bad taste no matter what
  yes this is poop chan
  background pampers  unko  blue abomination with wonky ribbons  name is literally ew  they betta be trollin
  its 500 fucking euros id pay that for a male stripper before id waste it on this abomination hell i can buy two jetj dresses on the 2nd hand market for that
  uhh what the fuck
  can we not pick on actual minors
  wrong kind of minor dummy vr is in her 40s dont worry
wow you people really like to bring other people down
  the shoes are what really fuck this up without the shoes its passable
  welcome to the internet
  that hair isnt passable in any universe
  
  only 440 before tax    and that website is an eyesore who looks at a normal website and says i really feel this could be improved by adding a bunch of scribbles and setting the font to illegible colors
  if its really big make a public appoligy otherwise just forget about it acknowledge your mistakes improve go on with life there is new drama on cgl pretty much every day being posted might seem big but if you actually improve your attitude and looks no one will look down on you worst that could happen is people might laugh at the past but then if you can acknowledge it it rarely will be a big deal you most likely end up as an example of how someone went from shitty to better cgl tends to acknowledged improvement as well as mistakes in my experience as long as there actually are improvements they aint gonna make improvements up to make you feel good
  i dont mind this shirts design at all im a sucker for florals that being said the thread had better be spun gold for that price
not lolita   also dear god why is this girl still here the entire uk community hates her
    you can do betterbesides mismatching the fabric types which is usually a bad idea the solid fabric looks slick and cheap if the whole blouse was the floral this would have been way better
  of course not wales has just over 3 million people in it youd be fucking exhausted
  oh wow this is so cringey and arrogant lol
she also makes super embarrassing posts like these lmao
ive literally never seen a lolita praising a living doll like where is she getting this from lmao
  she was probably getting praise from normies who thought she looked cute
  oh because normies have the best idea of what is cute  the normies that i encounter either call me a princess or ask if im doing victorian reenactment and neither of those responses inspire great trust in their judgement desu
  lmao who is this was she that super embarrassing girl on that show with venus and the guy who wanted to be a living ken doll
  
  bless those hosts to be honest they could have taken it in a completely different direction but they were kind and did their best to relate
replica  one million different shades of pink  thatsamanbabyjpeg
  oh wow poor whoever the fuck that is
  i hope this is sarcasm cuz she literally posts this kinda shit every day and then posts fucking walmart kei in cof and then goes on national tv to talk about her being a doll xd
  oh its that girl i dont recall anyone making fun of her when that video dropped i know living doll was the term itas used as an excuse to not take concrit and feel more special but i always thought she used the word doll in exchange for lolita so she wouldnt have to do the whole lolita isnt a fetish conversation   too bad i thought she was a normal person looks like the attention got to her head
  the faces the girls in the background are making are priceless
  unfortunately i think she uses living doll as an excuse to not have to adhere to lolita rules / she honestly thinks shes some kind of celebrity its weird but oh well
  she honestly thinks shes some kind of celebrity its weird    thats what i thought too but she only has 15 likes on her profile pictures doesnt sound popular at all
  whats this from
  i get more likes on my profile pictures and im not remotely efamous and i only have like 70 friends on my fb its sad either way that people are shitty to her but she sounds really deluded after that tlc thing so it kind of cant be helped
  what am i looking at and why is there not a single nice wig or hairstyle in the entire group
    please stop using emoji
  same my most liked propic has 70 likes and i have less than 500 friends to have 15 likes must mean your the opposite of popular lol
  wtf is wrong with using emoji
    exactly last i heard she went to mcm london comic con and threw a hissy fit when a photographer wanted a photo of another lolita next to her rather than her
  thats fucking tragic lmao
  this kinda stuff makes me feel like people are mocking lolita style like if you have no respect for our hobby gtfo
  hahaha youre on the wrong thread anon go back to amino
  sissy
  i dont know how that could possibly be interpreted as anything but sarcasm  literally look at how its worded
  the skirt and shoes have a lot of potential together and shes actually got a cute face she could go all the way and be adorable but of course instead she coords like a trash fire and puts it on the internet like its something to be proud of
  i too struggle to match my pinks i never have a pink bag while wearing a pink focused coord eugh plus its so insulting when people wear replicas like you dont deserve the dress if you cant find it/dont have the money bye people who claim their in this fashion have 0 respect for it sometimes
  cursed image
  hope the skirt is a replica no brand deserves this nightmare
    god these are fucking nightmares the lace on them makes them look like real brand too
  this blue color was really popular it couldnt have been cheap
  this could be decent with a better blouse and if she curled or poofed her hair
  this is fixable if shes only starting out
  not lolita
  people hate her because at one point on a tv show 100 hotter iirc she told everyone that she intentionally dressed as a 5 year old and used gross hashtags to advertise it on her insta    also shes a media whore        
  oh man she is so unfortunate looking
  toddlerfashion    gross
  yea so why do you think its posted here dumbass
    think this is the special set which goes for a reasonable price now
does this count as lolita the surge of weird pseudo lolita right now is confusing
  i dont consider it lolita
  why me why me  the answers always bpd      literally everyone in the public eye gets trolled and posted on the chins shes delusional
  spent 20000 bongbucks  that poundstore lipstick  tiara like some toddlers  tiaras reject  imaginary disease all snowflakes have  muh cundishuns  like some hambeast without being a ham wtf  doesnt even pull her skirt down to sit  jade  apex chav name  shes never gonna make it
  i want to learn krav maga just to roundkick these perverts in the hairy chin
  gosh its like were with the hacker called fohrchan
  new miss piggy design
  your in the wrong neighborhood faggot
  this is not lolita and she isnt trying to pass it as such
  from the thumbnail i thought this was gonna be a spoopy japanese ghost cosplay it turned out to be more horrifying
  the last time i did anything noteworthy from cgls standpoint was over 5 years ago but now and then it gets rehashed anyways and some people probably hear about it and decide to judge me based on that or to avoid me thats fine honestly ive done everything i possibly could to rectify my mistakes and make amends with the actual people involved and were all cool now so if a lurker or bystander thinks this is how anon is i know because i saw it on cgl then i dont really have to energy to try to convince them otherwise youve gotta just move on
  many living dolls who got in media lately werent lolitas more barbie the closest thing is one russian one was called lolita they where also ridiculed but there where also lovers     the only one that was maybe somewhat positively received was that one with the medical condition where her muzzles slowly broke down until she couldnt move and had to be tilted to anywhere by her bf but that was more a i rather not see lolita attached to this but good that she found a way to cope with that medical condition
  it needs work but its not awful put some makeup on tho
  nitpick she should have closed the collar of that blouse maybe add a red bow at her neck and wore shoes that fitted better in colour but its not good by any means but its not painful enough to be ita
  shes obviously wearing eyebrow pencil and it looks like light to dark brownish eyeshadow also either her skin is amazing or she wears foundation natural makeup is fine anon unless your coord is so ott it makes your face disappear without more ott makeup
  what its so bad its not even lolita not the office shirt not the retro circle skirt not the retro tstrap shoes not the hat nothing in this coord is lolita and the random green purse is just awful its like she fucked up a vintage outfit
  shes wearing a hat big pigtails has decent poof and her coord isnt pastel or nude its black with really intense colors she is wearing makeup but its not fitting or flattering some lipcolor exept nude would be the bare minimum also blush completely nude lips just drown in lolita
  thats not an office shirt not even close it has bad quality lace and a lacy somewhat bigger collar  that kind of shoe are more often worn in classic lolita but the colour has to change to something more matching  simple hats like that are worn in more daily coords more often for some casual lolita its fine  the skirt looks like it might very well be a simple lolita skirt it has cupcake shape and it doesnt look awkward forced in it    the bag i find arguably okay with the rose leaves but only if the roses/green theme comes back somewhere else
  disagreed she has a lot to improve upon but im not bothered by her makeup    also that aint big pigtails they are to braids pinned back up and black doesnt make ott you never seen casual alternative people they dont always wear big fancy ott makeup daily stuff like this is fine    honestly i agree on a different lipstick but i would go more natural pink instead of near skin colour nude bright lips would look horrible on her
  youre the unpopular opinion here this bitch is ita you probably look just like her blouse is of poor quality and much too small for her the white shoes dont match plain black tights make it look drab the skirt is so sub par granny made that where the hell does the purse fit in nothing about this is a good lolita coord
  bad cardi fit is nitpick this is not ita and pretty good for plus sweet and bl at that
  i cant believe she still continues to produce ugly af lolita clothing while apparently being actually succesful otherwise she has been to vancouver and london fashion week and is going to be in tokyos 2019 its hard to believe because her finnish is bad and she is trying to recruit apparently unpaid workers which is really unprofessional i have so many questions about her and her career
  whew youre not very bright are you
  when nothing is specifically lolita you dont look lolita loliables only work when you have some actual lolita pieces to carry the aesthetic basic ass tstraps and felt hats bring down even nicer coords to look more casual and normie heres theres nothing nice to bring down so it just looks like a normie got dressed in the dark
  iiiiiii suggested  why cant they follow my logic  im sorry but this is a classic faithless american white person response i am not and will never be muslim and even i understand the restrictions get some perspective that extends beyond the tip of your nose sweaty
  ilu anon
  agh so close yet so far if she takes concrit this could be fixed
  american white person  im from bosnia kek but you just keep wearing your ugly lolita coords sweaty
  i never said anything about ott her outfit is hardly lolita anyway and no contrast in the face especially when there is a lot of contrast everywhere else looks bad period
  someone has an opinion about a culture/religion   you must be amerikkkan scum reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  when youre only defence to saying casual makeup is fine on lolita unless you go ott is this  shes wearing a hat big pigtails has decent poof and her coord isnt pastel or nude its black with really intense colors  it sounds like that is too ott for you to wear natural makeup    also nice change from  put some makeup on tho  to  she is wearing makeup but its not fitting or flattering    i stay with my point tho natural looking makeup is common even in gothic lolita ever since the start of the fashion so black with intense colour is a bullshit excuse imho the lips would be better in the natural pinkish shade close to what peoples lips are than in this nude colour she doesnt have a nice shape at her lips nor the area around i dont think she should draw attention with bold colours there but her makeup isnt even near the thing that makes her look bad here its her clothes beside her lips her face doesnt disappear in the coord her eyebrows are speaking and the eyeshadow give her eyes enough dept for casual wear only the lips look gone i hating those more and more the more i look at it looking at the face also makes me hate those rose earrings she should have picked red ones to go with the skirt not skin coloured ones that look like her ear is misshaped
  so which picture is yours anon
  iridescent mickey ears are a recently released product  meaning this picture was taken this year  oof
  are you sure her intention was to dress lolita it looks like a closet wednesday adams costume
  at least the girl on the left is cute
  im not defending anything and no accessories does not mean ott  natural makeup doesnt equal nude or unflattering   also i did not make the post that says put on makeup     her makeup looks bad you can sperg all you want
  she posted it on closet of frills anon
  oh god thats horrible
  between the tea length and sack dresses its been tricky for me to decide if really toned down coord like this count as lolita either way shes in need of some headwear
  im cracking up at that tiny ass bow on her head
  the one where they are sitting back to back makes them both look pregnant
my eyes actually hurt
  wasnt this posted a few threads back lol get new content fag
  nayrt but wow calm down saltchan
what are thoooooose
  i hate that i dont hate this the tights are eh and the wig is cheap but i like the idea of the colors but maybe i have shit taste desu
  what are thooooose    seriously though theyre so awful in this color but could look okay in black with a punk coord
  whats up with these girls with long rapunzel hair that do absolutely fuckall with it stylewise
  that just looks like a long ebay wig anon
  does it the photo looks like it was edited with a potato and a prayer i cant tell if its a wig or not
  fun fact that girl got implants and became a patreon thot there is zero evidence of her lolita past on her social media
  ayrt this was posted on ig /today/ so no lol try again salty bloomers
  meant for 
trying to pass this replica as actual ap  most embarrassing behavior desu
  woah really im morbidly curious where can i look her up
  other than the shoes i like this it reminds me of creamy mami
  nvm i found her christ its a shame she looked a lot cuter in lolita/dolly/jfashions then this shit
  sauce on the blouse tho
  she was never into lolita she just jumped on the dolly fashion bandwagon and worked with dolldelight to try and help with her efame
  attention all dumb thots tutus are not lolita fashion
    care to share i dont know who this is
  thats not true she posts lolita stuff 
  i believe the anon was talking about the girl from my strange addiction she was already into cosplay when the episode aired
  how is m lolita the new my parents didnt pay enough attention to me trend   i hate it
  god you really dont fucking understand islam do you  there are countries where the penalty for apostasy is death even in developed countries people can be condemned harassed and threatened with physical violence by their family members or members of the muslim community for apostasizing its not like these are some sjw white girls who decided to collect snowflake points by converting to islam
  those are emoticons
  wtf is going here
    i wanna know wtf those girls in the background are wearing goodness
  are those wings her actual hair
  theyre obviously made of feathers have you ever seen real hair in your life
  lmaooo
  they have almost the same color so i thought it was hair guess im blind
  nayrt generally in these places they are also not allowed to wear weird frilly pink fashion tho the ones that can are in the fashion tend to be muslims with a lot more freedom than the ones you talk about i think this was already mentioned anyways
ott but do you guys think randoserus are allowed in sweet lolita i got bashed in a fb comm because i said randoserus are ageplay and have no place in lolita
  theyre fine imo  ageplay meme
  ageplay    what the fuck its just a bag its like a cosplay staple and people wear them with seifuku without being ageplay too
  it is a bag only worn by elementary students is lolita cosplay now its ageplayish
  i think its fine if youre in the west most people dont know what a randoseru is or that its for kids so i think most people will not attribute it to ageplay
  shes so ugly
  this is a nitpick at best
  i think ageplay is a huge reach randoseru in adult sizes are becoming more and more common in glorious nippon and not for ageplay purposes    theyre very roomy durable bags that last a long time and can be passed down because theyre good quality theyre not fucking cheap in price either whats not to want especially as a college student or working person   theres my wank on it though
  thats like saying being into dolls is ageplay because dolls are for kids its just a bag anon a comfortable sleek one at that id rather see more randoseru at meets than another fucking kanken bag
  why do i feel like this is simply26    not enough frills and the colorblocking is strange i feel like the only thing salvageable here is her shoes theres just too much normietier styling happening to make this visually interesting      she looks like an orb that shit dont fit no matter how you slice it      this could work as somewhat casual with a cardigan a removal of that bow and a reevaluation of whatever the fuck is going on with that legwear/shoes
  muzzles
nasty
  i think this dress would be really cute worn regularly but definitely not lolita lol
  posts a literal fetishist
  wheres this pic from
  god this girl looks like she doesnt shower
  hating a religion that considers women an object isnt racist i hope these girls escape this religion and/or country and denounce it
  i want that nice chair
  a liar in the ita thread  lying aint cute it makes you an autoita
  honest question how can you tell
  the print isnt crispand the colors are off the shoulder straps are wrong the bottom lace is too long the bow is not the same shape and is super floppy incorrect lace around the bodice top border
  what is a bra
  i really dont like this but its more nitpick the wig tights and shoes should be swapped i dont really like this persons coordinates when i see them but i hope they improve       the guy is a fetishist for latex and shit but its unclear about lolita his coordinates are cute as shit though hes cuter than 99 of lolitas
  r/lolita
  he posts latex fetish stuff sometimes which is gross but i dont think lolita is so much a fetish for him as it is a hobby    i can usually tell just by lace length but just look at the entire jsk replica tells present here are  the print is washed out   the bow is wrong and sad   the lace is too long
  ooo i see it now so obvious when you point it out
    but is he actually a sissy i dont see anything wrong with the coord itself when i cover his face
  i dont see anything wrong with the coord itself  sorry you must be blind let me help you frumpy replica 10000 shades of pink a beard this coord might look passable when you scroll over it real quick but take a second and look at all the mismatched shit going on
  oof that damaged hair
i need motivation to get my shit together and these threads motivate me to get my stuff clean
these rooms are all so cute now that im married i feel bad making my room girly and cute
  why  who cares youre an adult youre in control of your life so if you wanna make your room cute and girly do it  you got one life dont waste it regretting not doing cutesy things
  shit this is inspirational i need this printed on my wall or somethin
  i dont feel bad liking cute things as an adult i dont care what others think i feel bad having an ultra girly room and then my husband has like one poster on the wall and hes buried under all my cute stuff
  make his room girly too fuck it
      just treat it like everything else in your marriage  negotiate divvy up what parts of the house you can go full girly on and what parts are his bastions of manliness    who knows apparently some dudes like cute stuff and are totally into letting their sos kawaii take over everything so they dont have to look gay to their friends just whipped or at worst he lets you know he would like the living room to match his xbox better and then the two of you can figure out how to both be happy in that shared space
selfposting because im excessively proud of my old rooms
  im married too anon most of our house is our normal tastes i dont want to be controlling and i want him to enjoy the space too but i have one seperate room that i go full ham in its my dressing room it doesnt have a bed but it has a vanity and closet for lolita i put all my girly cute stuff in there     i want to post it in these threads one day but its still wip but finally getting close to done

anyone has recommandations of lace gloves for lolita on taobao i have looked at sweetdreamer but the ones i liked are no longer in stock i have also tried keyword search but i get normie gloves for driving
  should be a lot of results if you search for 蕾丝手套 lolita
stupid question but can you order from taobao living in japan does it change anything regarding ss im moving from the us im assuming shipping is cheaper to japan
  youd still need to order with a ss but shipping might be cheaper considering its not as far
  thats what i was thinking as well are there any tariffs/taxes when ordering from china
size 3339  custom sizing
  sorry dropped the link  dark colors     light colors 
i found pic related and was kind of curious if anyone owns this blouse are their shoulder measurements accurate or is there some wiggle room upwards i have about 40cm of shoulder width but the biggest size only goes up to 39cm     also whats the quality of this blouse like apparently its lined with velvet  but im scared the quality is so awful that it wont let any air through and turn me into a sweaty mess    link 
  i find the shoulder measure to be true to size however because of how the shoulders are constructed you can probably squeeze an extra cm out of it     the construction of the blouse is good and i find the velvet soft and it does breathe a bit but because it is thicker its not the best as long as you dont pour out sweat easily its fine just wear a decent deodorant and dont run if youre worried the outer layer is polyester i believe and it feels like its slightly lower quality but its pretty good for the price slightly rough in texture but its only noticeable if youre looking for that sort of thing     i wore it to a few meets over the fall and its been nice both indoors and out overall id give it an 8/10 its not perfect but for the price point its a good staple especially in colder weather
does anyone know how to sear h for meteor garden goods
where can i get a good aline petticoat

  1111 is soon whos excited
be fattychan  ordered a bunch of cute clothes from specialized shops for fattychans not custommade  stuff starts arriving at ss  receive pictures of items  3/5 turn out to be replicas and kind of bad too  superbuys photos are potato quality so might be making the items look worse than they are  even with better pictures clothes definitely not as pictured on website  check the listings again  none of them accept returns  mfw    how screwed am i gulls
  probably fucked since youre going through an ss you cant cry to paypal to get your money back when theres a middleman involved
  i think superbuys photos are really good at showing the photos for what they are if you click the image it opens a higher res in a new tab you could get some money back if u open an inquiry and tell them its different from the photos
  welp thanks anyway      the fullsize pics are blurry even in big size its definitely fine for getting a general idea of what the item looks like not in this case where the details matter if i want to get a closer look at the items i have to purchase extra pictures which i hope will be hd this time i love superbuy i just wish their pictures were a bit better quality    the items are definitely different than the pictures on the listings so i might just have a chance with that
  huh thats so weird because my photos are usually pretty clear that sucks yeah just be like why doesnt this look like the photos or something from my experience their customer service is pretty good good luck
    release date for the new collection is the 30th
  malco modes or aurora  ariel
  ive ordered from aurora and ariel before but i guess i just overlook their alines are something i even ordered pettis i thought would be aline but turned out to be bellshaped
  they have a bunch up right now id say check the customer pictures in the evaluations tab to make sure it looks like what youre after when its worn theyre a popular enough store that there are usually customer pictures on their listings
has anyone used spreenow recently i ordered an outfit from taobao and i decided to pull the trigger on spreenow since ive seen good reviews for it i paid extra for ems and it still isnt here nor has the tracking updated    it sucks even more since it seems that whenever i used japan ems it got here super fast every time any actual good ss recs
does anybody know of any taobaos to get lolita purses the only one i know of is loris/lolitaromance
  taobaotrends
  milkyway and whalefall are both good
  berry q is also cute with original designs
  im not sure if its really much of a thing anymore but its a cutesy style inspired by 90s girl stuff think the movie clueless barbies toys etc its more about pop colors and less about pastels         
  these are terrible and i love them
1111 is coming are you prepared
  ive hauled before but never 1111 so i have some dumb questions    1 any sses particularly good/bad for 1111 what about direct  2 when should i finalize my order do i need to pay by 1111 chinese time or a few days before/after    ill have to browse the lolita shops and see if theres anything i want as well if i think of more questions ill be sure to drop them in here
  basically every shopping service is going to be packed a lot of them will let you know ahead of time what their schedule for 1111 is most ask you to have your order in early and marked as for 1111 so they can buy everything immediately instead of waiting for you to pay
  1111 is frankly not that good sellers just jack up prices beforehand and slash them during 1111 except most of the time even after being slashed the prices are still higher than what they were maybe a month before i keep stuff my cart for months and months to keep track of prices and without fail 1111 is almost always higher price than normal because a shit ton of people start buying since they think theyre getting deals
  1111 is frankly not that good  this did it twice and saved maybe 510 on 250300 orders
  every taobao store that has moon replicas has the pastel colors but not a single black   cant find the original anymore either  are there any alternative moonshaped bags but in black i can never find one
so i am in a huge pickle i got a custom made dress for my wedding from taobao from classical puppets ss says they will only be able to ship in out dec 3 which is 3 months after i ordered but i absolutely need it by january 1st at the latest what is the fastest shipping method i dont mind paying a lot for it as long as it arrives in time
  ems or dhl  nothing you can do because holiday shipping will delay every single method
  thank you how long would you say dhl or ems will take
    for me dhl is a lot faster will arrive within the week takes a few days ems will take more like 2 weeks during the holidays
release at the 28th  
  i hate the different lacing on each of the brown boots looks shitty why would you do that
  it depends on your location the one thats faster for you varies for me im near la so dhl takes 4 days while ems takes 10
hey guys posted this before but it just came in todayeverything is really nice for the price
  these are adorable they actually go up to my shoe size i want to scream
  ooh where did you get the sheer blouse and the red sweater beautiful
    this is the store ive bought from them before and i think their quality has improved tenfold i wouldnt recommend buying the cutout sweaters if they have any i got one before and it was total garbage the cutout looked horrible other than that theres some real cute casual lolita and otome stuff
  omgg where did u get the tights and red cardigan from  link pls
  thanks anon and especially thanks for the recommendation youre a sweetheart
  cardigan is this link   tights are   they are the best quality tights ive ever gotten on taobao most of the tights i get on taobao are kinda shit but these ones arent very thin and look good they have a few tights there which are all probably good quality ive also bought wristcuffs from them and theyre really nice
    i live on the west coast so i pray it makes it here in time last time i ordered i lived on the eat coast which took forever thanks to usps
  how stretchy do you think they are
  i just used them for a 750 order they had amazing response always answered me withing a half day items took a bit of time for some reason and they called the post office to find where my stuff was everything was great and they gave me a bag of cute as hell free stuff this was my second time with them ill never use anyone else desu
i have a huge order going and split some of it up these arrived today and i have to gush they are probably the nicest quality shoes ive ever gotten from taobao if they reopen preorders im definitely getting more colors     i wear a size 42 and have big ankles regardless of my weight my ankles are always trunks these fit beautifully on my large gaijin feet and ankles each strap has adjusters so you can fit it better to your foot the suede material is incredibly soft way nicer than i would expect        no worn pics because im recovering from surgery so i cant wear tights and my legs are hairy af
  not very stretchy wouldnt recommend them to people with larger hips unless planning on cutting them into thigh highs or something
  oh wow i was on the edge of getting these and i didnt but reading this and others reviews i hope they do sell again so i can get a pair if you eventually do decide to take photos i would love to see
  size 42    how long and wide is your foot are they roomy for you i usually settle for 43 or 265  270 for sizing because i have terrible gaijin duckfeet 10cm width without putting weight on them but id love to own a pair of these
  its up to you if you want to try them out ill give you the details   my feet are size 42/260 in japan i just measured and my foot width is about 9cm     they arent excessively big on me but they are a beautiful fit with some room which is great for a heel you want to have some room because of the suede material it does feel accommodating
  how are the chocolate clips from sweetdreamer been thinking about getting some myself
  theyre really nice they look exactly like the picture they are probably the nicest things i got from them
anyone have links/names for shoes like these
  those are just regular thicksoled sneakers
  i was looking for holographic shoes since i vaguely recalled someone from here posting some way back
  nayrt but if you search on google for holographic platform sneakers you will get a lot of shopping results
  ive always used spreenow and ive yet to have any problems with them their only issue is that theyre slow with preorders i wouldnt worry too much yet anon their customer service is generally good and theyll probably be willing to help you out
  dude why would you want to get those on taobao the shipping is going to be a pain
anyone have experience with any good sailor moon cosplays from tb ive seen a bunch on there but a lot look as if theyre super shiny/bad quality in general
  definitely still a thing half of takeshita street looked like this when i went to harajuku this summer
anyone know where to find pic related ive only seen them on those sites where they inflate the prices crazily
  only found these colors  
  ohh those are cute too thanks anon
  theyre on ebay and aliexpress
  
  second this    all i ever find is shitty satin or bedsheet quality cosplays
has anyones tb order been super delayed lately  my package with ems has been waiting to depart on airline for 4 days
  is there a holiday going on
  golden week was at the start of the month but usually its cleared up by now 11/11 rush hasnt started yet either so im not sure
  were on the same boat anon i also paid ems and has been stuck on preparing for shipment it has been 2 weeks now
i havent found the source yet but chinese lolita updates posted these cute shoes   multiple colors black red white gold silver pink lav sax  sizes 3444    brand is listed as sugar and the design is called doris   its when they have these generic ass names its harder to track them down
  ahhh yes realized searching lolita 鞋 and narrowing search by size 44 brought them up easily  heres the link gulls 
  excellent work  does chinese lolitas not post links im guessing they dont
  no lmao i follow the facebook page because they are great at announcing updates but they wont post links as a sort of indirect way for you to use their ss and not a different ss    say you see something on their facebook that you love you scour the internet forever and still cant find it youre faced with the decision of either a using their shopping service to purchase or b just not buying it at all
  pretty much every photo has a weibo url or shop url watermarked onto it if you really cant find the source youre probably retarded
  ive had good luck reverseimage searching pictures from chinese lolita updates to find the direct links to items try it next time it saves a lot of time
  a lot of the weibo marks are just full on chinese and too low quality for a translator to pick up wtf it is       its a good idea but doesnt always work for me
      just curious do they answer if you directly ask them what taobao shop it is
has anyone bought any of these rings  i just need some costume jewelry that wont turn my fingers green or have the metal coloring wear off after a week
  paint the inside with clear nail polish
  week of wear  just splurge for silver anon its not that expensive
  does silver come in black
  they always write the brand names in the posts but no they wont post links
   yes oxidized silver
  copy the chinese characters by hand using the pencil/draw google translate tool and search it in google you either are too lazy to or are too retarded to as stated previously
    not even if you ask them directly for a link do they give an excuse or just ignore the question    for real im just curious about how far they take not giving links seems like they kinda suck but if theyre willing to post links upon request then they dont seem so bad
is there a reason why taobao takes me to the login page and is not allowing me to search i cant make an account with them at the moment i refuse why should i have to have an account to search is it just my computer im so frustrated
  when servers are overloaded preference is given to users with taobao accounts either make a taobao account or come back later
i know this is weird but does anyone have a taobao account theyre not using that i can log into i just got locked out of mine randomly and its not letting me make a new one
does anyone know where i can buy shortshorts like these preferably in black or grey the main things im looking for are the large cuffs and buttons
any gulls have links to some weird shit    like odd engrish shirts weird toys im looking for stocking fillers
  everything looks beautiful link to the shortsleeved blouse top left and pink headband please
i havent cosplayed outside of my room before or had much experience with wigs outside of some cheap ones on taobao but i purchased one from this store recently and it feels amazing the strands are extremely light and soft and feel like real hair rather than synthetic they can trim and style the wig for you which was useful for me because i dont know how to do styling some of the wigs require a certain number of people to buy them before they are manufactured though so take note before ordering makes me feel very cute but i dont know how realistic it is    
hello fellow taobao users  i need shopping services advice  ive been using taobaoring for a while   but they raised their percent recently and also for some reason even their cheapest shipping method is kinda too pricey for me   i also used youbuy and their shipping was way more affordable but for some reason they kept sending things for to my direct address but to some really distant warehouse and its pain in the ass to get there   should i check bhiner or something else is it just me that taobaorings shipping price seems way higher than it should be
  spreenow is great
  but they raised their percent recently  they didnt its always been 8 when there isnt a anniversary or event going on
  have you contacted yoybuy about the shipping thing  i think superbuy and bhiner are okay
  i find cssbuy tax free shipping pretty cheap  recently moved to us tho so no point in using shopping service for me anymore
  superbuy  ytaopal  everything else  superbuy is cheap and has good service but doesnt have the best english ytaopal is more expensive but has far better service and much better english      cssbuy has a habit of mixing up packages and you receiving someone elses
does anyone have reviews on pumpkin cat two piece sets similar to this because i really want to reserve it but im not sure how itll hold up and if itll be worth it ie i wont buy it if its standard cotton with a tartan print
im having a hard time finding any stores with good clock bags do you guys know where i can find one
well i foundthis     
gift box bag    
  i have heard this year the prices must be reduced by what the prices have been for the last 3 months to try and prevent sellers doing this     so they cant jack the price up in the last 2 weeks then slash for 1111 this is by tmall anyways so im not sure if taobao will have the same policy going on  hoping so i have so much shit in my cart waiting for my deals
  is this for every single item we place in our cart or just some items  cause i j7st found a could dresses i want and i doubt theyre going to mark down this stuff
what the fuck is up with yoybuy i cant get in  you login ip is not in conformity with recently timesplease come to the register email and verify to ensure the account security  this is literally the same phone and computer i ever use i checked my email and got no message anyway what do
  i dont think they have to mark things down but i think what it means is it has to be a reduced price based on what they have been selling the item for the last few months     like if the item were originally 50cny 2 weeks before they jack it up to 100cny then on 1111 slash to 50cny and claim huge 50 discount     most stores with original or expensive items tend not too cut too much from the price if anything unless its the clearance stock they want rid of
i split up my order and received some stuff just wanted to let you guys know how they turned out        got 3 of these long sleeve blouses the sizing turned out good for a custom size they are actually opaque instead of that sort of seethrough chiffon so many stores use     ive yet to buy a taobao blouse i like more than dear celines quality overall im happy with the quality of the blouses but i would say they are a bit below dc but better than most lolita blouses from random shops
              i wanted to comment on these mostly for fit and maybe help some chubbier girls out    all of the items fit me and i am plussize i am pearshaped though so my bust isnt unmanageable  my measurements are 37cm shoulder 96cm bust 86cm waist     the cardigans are good quality and fit the best the darker red one is double layer of knit which would keep you warm the cutlery one is brighter and perfect for something like milky berry    the sheer blouse things are the quality you would expect very transparent and just a sheer layer with some elastic sewn in they are however soft and not scratchy like i was half expecting the elastic bottom sits on my waist so it isnt very long it fits me more like those half blouse things that were popular last summer that would keep you cooler but its not a problem because im planning to wear it for layering under jsks and dresses
  just buy the real baby ones secondhand the replicas all look worse
how often do lizjill restock been waiting on two pairs of shoes to come back in the size/colour i want for well over a year
does anyone know the term for meteor garden merch
  dont know if this is actually in effect because ive noticed a ton of shops hiking prices within the past month
  any shops for curvier girls who like mature cute lizbabe for reference
  yeah im not sure how they intended to monitor it the thing i read did specifically say tmall though so maybe it just excludes taobao entirely      not sure either way its pretty shady and shitty of them
ive been trying to find this piece of clothing on taobao with no luck jumpsuit bodysuit romper i cant get this exact thing with those search terms any advice
  it definitely isnt my cart is more expensive than it was two days ago
good luck for 11/11 guys also taobaoring is the cutest ss ever
i just paid for my order on taobaoring via paypal and when i went to go look at the items i ordered again it said i hadnt paid is this normal i paid for it like half an hour ago i have the paypal receipt for the payment and everything
  why would you need to go through taobao for that
  yeah dont worry about it for now check again tomorrow  sometimes things take a little to process
any suggestions on what keywords to use to find this set
  idk what the keyword is but heres a direct link to the set had to put in spaces because it wouldnt let me post     m/itemht mspma1z 103csw400218538804473 112404723a 5sxorfkid5 629 51161 399
  why taobao and not aliexpress
man i dont get paid until tuesday if i confirm an order and pay in two days will it still be at the current price i wonder    can i even pay later ive always paid straight away so i have no idea 
  my understanding  taobao  good for large orders and/or if you want to buy a million things  aliexpress  good if theres only one or two things you really want also for small things like socks or keychains    price per item on taobao is usually around half of what i see on ali but you make up for in ss fees and shipping so youll have to buy a lot at once to make it worth it
  i was gonna post something like this their english isnt the best but it kind of makes them cute
  nope they kicked up a big fuss about people asking a while ago
treated myself to an early birthday haul

    what are you getting my dudes i can never find that much money worth of stuff besides shoes ill get like 3 dresses a year at most that i like on tb
ive not used taobao for a while and find that its asking me to log in before i can actually browse ive tried a few vpns but thats not working  any advice on how to get around this
  the only thing you can do is make an account
    okay thanks
how much do you guys usually spend on a taobao order  thinking about taking the plunge and doing a taobao order for the first time
  around 100
  thats a shame to hear i got it as a replacement for my old one from them which has been great but i think is at the end of its life i did hear some things about their pettis declining in quality recently but wasnt really sure where else was worth getting one from
hey bros the kind folks at /csg/ over in /g/ suggested i ask here anyone got a 1688 agent that will be more flexible with shipping im trying to order an electromagnetic device that other sellers are shipping internationally on alibaba but every agent ive tried so far superbuy cssbuy bhiner is telling me they wont ship because its prohibited so im looking for someone more flexible
  worst case scenario you can go through our shopping service spreadsheet that may be outdated and just check their prohibited items lists bit tedious though    have you tried a forwarding service
  300400 depending on financial situation but ive done small 100 loots before too
  hmm what would be a good forwarding service to try     im more than willing to go through all the agents on the spreadsheet but it seems likely they all use the same shippers and will refuse me 
  if you can find what you want on taobao they have their own forwarding service now for international purchases they seem to care less what you buy
im really looking to order a tartan lolita dress for the christmas time i wasnt sure if i should look up a certain phrase on taobao or if anyone had links to some shops for me any help is appreciated
  nayrt but ive gotten contraband item can not be warehoused notices for everything from cat toys to craft items using the taobao warehousing/forwarding service sometimes its fine but they can be really picky
so i was able to purchase directly from taobao but my dumbass somehow managed to purchase just the item and it did not include the shipping fee nor did it take me to the shipping options can someone please help an idiot
    only about 300 of the stuff was mine i only ever order from taobao if at least 2 other people are ordering with me since it significantly helps with the ems fee    sorry for the shitty collage image my first time actually making one of these shits looking back on it i cant really wear most of this in public since im a guy whoops
do any of you have experience with custom tailored suits from taobao im a petite ftm tranny who doesnt fit into european and american suits
  then just buy the non tailored chink suits anon theyre petite size so youll have a good chance at fitting them     if you really want tailored im not sure about suits but ive had friends who had cosplays tailored and it turned out really well
  great tastes malegull link to the brapanty sets ad the shorter wig
is there a particular term for art prints made by the seller like the kind you get at an artist alley i can only find prints with what i assume is stolen art
im having an issue the seller says he cant ship overseas he said there is a transport option on your taobaos account pls check it will send you an address in china  anybody know where to find this option
     likely doesnt know what theyre talking about my brother had one of those overpriced chinese bespoke suits made but honestly it fit him really well it was the best he looked in a suit even the petite suits from china looked oversized or wrongly fitted on him you just need a proper fitting and then you can send the measurements off if you know how to take your own measurements correctly youll be fine if you dont ask a friend or seamstress to help you
  are trying to buy direct from taobao youd have to use a forwarding service for that aka the chinese warehouse they send your stuff to and then the warehouse mails to you
  short wig     lingerie sets   
  could i get a link to the longer wig and what looks like the binder
  thank you
  yes he said that taobao offers an option for it do you know where in the site i can find it
  sorry ive not used their forwarding service personally so i cant tell you but other gulls can help
    most of it is from a store that is pretty pricy but quite good quality for what you get i bought some stuff two years ago and since then i couldnt help myself because their skirts are ridiculously thick and warm and their shirts are really good quality but still casual enough for otome its one of the only stores i buy on tmall and i always look at reviews before i buy as well i couldnt get several items though so i did end up getting about 100 usd in refund the others were just some extra shirts which honestly i could get from aliexpress but since i was buying with an ss why not
  link to the ω hoodie and wallet

i havent ordered from taobao much what is the fastest ss generally theres a few things i need before the end of the year probably a bit of a close shave but eh

  i love how unusual prints are getting now

  update my order arrived and you were completely right the petti itself is very soft and nice but incredibly flat and disappointing functionally looks like ill need to go elsewhere from now on
does anyone own tighs and socks from yidrah how do their sizes compare i have two pairs of otks but cant fit into them due to my fit calves are their tights more forgiving
  their tights are much more roomier than the otks i have two pairs of otks and they get a bit strict near the thighs the tights thought are soft and fit nicely
  thanks anon ill give it a try then with my next order
  i posted on the worn pics thread already but it seems kind of dead does anyone have have any pics of this that arent stock photos or already on the pages linked im worried the fabric may look like shit irl
idk if anyone here likes angura fashion but either way  
  ct posted one to cof last month from the first release
  this was a style i didnt know i needed thanks
  kind of hard to see the dress alone but the material looks fine    i just ordered the black jsk cant wait
everything in this shop is so cute         lots of imoutokeiish stuff i guess but there are a lot of just generally good staples to be found
  jealous the dresses remind me a bit of aps gold silk screen on velvet which i miss and love wish i could order both prints in black but the measurements look a smidge too small for me     hope some gulls preorder because the print looks absolutely lovely
newfag here just tried opening up taobao and it says i have to login when did this happen

unsure which to get any tips

  niiiiice i have an order with them but its on preorder until dec hopefully i can either get dhl or the strike will be over by then    also sorry to sperg about it but i follow canada post news closely even though i dont work for them i always see people complaining without really knowing whats going on since its a union there are two sections of cp lol one is the union itself cupw and the other is the corporation canada post they are in negotiations between the two for a new working contract   cupw the union wanted to continue taking international packages but cp put a hold on them i feel like they did this as a tactic to put pressure on the union to settle since the public government and various online retailers are upset by this     i support cupw and although its an inconvenience for me as an import and exporter i hope that they can get a fair working agreement their main issues they are trying to settle is a shady pay inequality between female and male workers mandatory overtime and injuries while on the job     i have two parcels containing ap stuck in transit and i cri

hey so im not dead i swear    new sheet changes as of today went through all sections and purged dead links 50 added shop ratings for several new sections updated ratings for others   aiming to add in any remaining items from the suggestion tab within the next day or so feel free to keep adding with anything youve used recently as well as do some hunting for new ones to replenish certain sections
  also considering adding a section for handy cosplay supplies ie leds foam fake tattoos hat bases specialty fabrics shoe inserts hoopskirts safety shorts wig styling accessories crossplay supplies etc i realise that some items may cross over with the general diy page but i figure it might be handy to have a general page to link to for that kind of specific thing
  are those just mh heads do they have lots of full dolls like that
  if u need help lmk
  cute
    anyone have a clue on what the color options mean doing some rough translates i get the idea of the first option being solid/ one piece and the second being a split but is that really all it is or is it something completely different
  might refer to how the bangs are styled
  is there a regular and saber alter version saber alter has paler hair and no ahoge
when you use an ss are taobao sellers typically notified about it like if you have an agent from say superbuy reach out to correspond with a seller on your behalf do they usually clarify that theyre speaking for an overseas customer  i wonder if ive ever deliberately been fucked over by a seller out of xenophobia
  ive ordered alot of stuff through superbuy and never had a problem except for one time where the seller refused to sell to me for the specific reason  i went on the chat thing and asked him  that i was an overseas buyer he justified it by saying it was something to do with not wanting the hassle of a return if it didnt fit me or something
  thanks anon anything you can contribute shopwise is super appreciated either via the suggestions page of the sheet or in this thread also my apologies if any of you shared shops in previous threads and i missed them ill be going through the archive soon to check and add as necessary
  there is an alter version in the store without these options so i didnt think that it would be that      oh thats a good idea ill check thank you
  whether the bun is permanently affixed or an attachment   solid one piece and the wig will be smaller  limited separate pieces
  its is currently out of stock         yes just the heads they have bodies too you can get super cheap knockoff ones which look and pose like regular ones just shit plastic or legit ones i believe for around 5  so if you want the bodies it probably works out cheaper buying them second hand
    yes they really are i actually use these clothes for work a lot theyre pretty good quality despite or because rather being pricey and they last a while plus the skirts almost always have pockets compared to the long skirts ive bought on aliexpress these are obviously much better made with linings that actually serve function and thick cloth that feels like real wool     unfortunately a lot of items are out of stock now so ill just link you the website i got it from            for most of these items i got it from the store above again unfortunately theyre mostly gone but i recommend the long skirts  theyre usually very good quality and really warm during winter    qipao blouse looks disappointing from the pics tbr gave me but well see when it arrives       sweater dress     side tie shirts 
  thank you so much
  thank makes way more sense thank you

as things are rolling into my sss office    left is dream holics stock photo right is picture taken by ss i asked them if it was the wrong color ss said we sent the same photo to the seller and asked and they said it was right is this just a camera/lighting difference or actually a quality issue     btw the wig is supposed to be the loveletter style in white linen
  dreamholic is notorious for photoshopped pics
i remember finding a pair of degenerate ass pantyhose with writing and graffiti all around the crotch and upper leg likely based off of some doujin i cant seem to find it again anymore though and searches arent coming up with anything anyone got any leads i would have expected it to come from a store like nonori or seventy three
  i know exactly what youre talking about but all my links are dead maybe they went on a purging spree  if i find them again though ill share
  well it looks accurate its mostly the lighting  super bright vs dim fluorescent light
does anyone have any fabric recommendations from taobao looking for heavier fabrics for winter but also just pretty shit florals tartans and other nice fabrics that focus on texture rather than prints      once i ordered a wig that looked pale grey from dh i got a fucking black ombre to dark grey wig i always warn people from buying from them theyre basically glorified scammers
  where can i get this wig
is there a shopping service thats able to use something like those space saver bags i want to buy a ton of stuffed toys but shipping them without being compressed would be expensive

is page 7 too early for a new thread 
past thread     matches have been sent out if you have not received anything contact us immediately    continue your questions and discussion here
  everyone should also be receiving an email about their id     apparently our sheet was regenerating ids every time we logged in and out of it so depending when your email was sent it may have effected what id you received     the one in the email you are receiving now has the id your santa would have received so for those panicking about their id not being posted it is possible you are looking out for the wrong number     apologies for me being a dumbass
  8612 with my real id here now that i have it    i am definitely not averse to scents and the only thing my skin is sensitive to is benzoyl peroxide

  i mean santas only gave me my own new id and not my matches so i dont know if they changed too
  flick me an email and ill put your name down
  if im reading correctly all the santas have done is emailed your matches with the id they originally sent you for them so if youve heard from your matches thats fine
i dont understand why people have their panties in a bunch over communication as long as you dont spoil what the gift is its fine and actually makes the experience pleasant    i have social anxiety myself but seeing both my santa and giftee are so kind and friendly makes me feel reassured and even more excited for the holiday season
  this is pr from pa sorry for the late reply i didnt realize this was me because of the id mix up xd     i would love a phone case however i only use phone wallet style cases and my phone is a pain to find cases for i have an lg nexus     if you did somehow manage to find a cute phone wallet for my phone though i would love you forever
  actually im apparently 5477 if you want to ask me anything but i dont mind at all
  ooh i can try to search at the very least lg nexus which kind i googled it and im not sure if the different gens have different model styles
the confusion with ids has got me panicking a little if anyone is gifting to a dc from the uk id really appreciate just letting me know youve seen my form
  im your santa and im already working on your gift your message was really wellthought and included a lot of useful ideas
dumping gift inspo from last year

id 5053 aka bc from il   could i get some manner of clothing sizes im about to bid on some things but it would be really shitty to get a ss gift with clothes that dont fit  or if youd rather i not get you clothes thats fine too
  sa from oh here anon so sorry to take so long in the end i feel so bad because i had to send you a million pictures aghhh im so so sorry i had been trying to compile it onto one website only to realize that it didnt actually have a share function im sorry youll have to suffer through these images oof only thing not on there is i think im going to try and get the new meta grimoire print in garnet but well see how that goes ha    i hope this turns out helpful and i didnt torture you with a torrent of collages for nothing santa anon

  as a gag gift my santa bought a really ugly dress and painted it badly to look like my dream dress
cf from new zealand 5496 do you like black and white gingham do you have any main pieces in black and white gingham
  was it green thats pretty cruel
lt from nsw id 3862 are you okay with used/secondhand brand socks they would of course be in acceptable condition no gross blackonthebottom socks and i would wash and fix them up as best i can before sending its ok if you would prefer new legwear only i understand
  thats hilarious i hope you got a real gift with it
  oh i did they also sent me a gorgeous newly released dress but it was wrapped in this box with weird newspaper clippings all over it the whole package was designed to be weird and confusing and it was great
  i dont mind it but i prefer solids i have a couple of ancient ap gingham pieces but not a lot
hi 2922 just letting you know ive started to buy your gifts thanks for the informative form and wardrobe/wishlist they were really helpful     also hello 8640 i loved your form a lot and you seem like a fun and cultured person im just looking at a partially shirred item thats waist up to 81cm according to lolibrary would that be alright or should i give it a miss
  its a nexus 5x but i believe some of the models are compatible with each other though im not sure which    im sorry my phone is a pain i had to get it to get googlefi
  8640 here im so glad you enjoyed it thats incredibly sweet of you to say  ___   anyways thats a good question its hard to say since i think it would zip but i dont want to risk it looking unflattering or like some ita stuffed sausage ive had some pieces looking at you meta that had close to 10cm more than the lolibrary listing which ended up being perfectly comfortable but maybe just play it safe and give it a miss i hate to say it since im sure it was something really nice too thank you so much for checking though
    i just thought id add that if you think its a piece id really enjoy im open to altering it and making sure it fits well ive altered a few sentimental items that i really liked the print but not so much the cut so i think i could a good job of it
  great to hear from you im so glad i asked i would have gone in a completely different direction otherwise but now i have something to work with already started shopping  i really hope everything will be to your liking  one last question do you have any allergies i may want to add some small snacks so if there is anything you cant eat or dont like please let me know
  im sure it will im not really allergic but i cannot eat coconut id love some local snacks i really like discovering other cultures by talking to locals etc if i cant eat something my bf will so itll be okay
me cackling away as i only realise now like a dumbass that i will get paid again before the shipping deadline so i can spoil my santa
ns and jm from canada im on the lookout for some accessories that match your styles but your gifts might be tailored more towards your other interests hoping thats ok also thank you for your very comprehensive forms
  i have no issues with second hand socks i prefer them actually since theyll get trashed from regular use anyhow
tfw you find your giftee one of their dream dresses     feel like i have to add something to the package to make it feel like a bit more but so excited to send this off
  jm here thats no problem at all im touched that youre looking for accessories but id also be totally happy with a bag full of candy and tea haha
my giftee was super helpful with their form and i managed to snag three  of their wanted items i am including other misc stuff that i think would suit them too     ends up being a large gift and i will need to send it across the worldgonna be extra careful with the packaging    so excited
tfw i usually have reservations paying full price for firsthand brand and above retail for secondhand but ill totally do it for my giftee  is this what they call the spirit of giving
  ns here no problem at all as well im sure youll find a some cute stuff im pretty easy to please so dont worry too much
anyone else really struggle with making a package that looks like its worth the tier im in the 3040 dollar bracket and ive spent 50 but when i look at what ive bought it doesnt look like enoughive bought things i think theyll love and i like the items and think theyre nice gifts buti planned on spoiling anyway but im not sure what im doing wrong
  fancy wrapping helps
  i know that feel too one of my gifts is in the 1525 tier and i just bought a single item that was actually like 30 and im sitting here feeling like i cant just send it as is going to try that fancy wrapping technique       since its been so quiet on here how would everyone say theyre doing in terms of purchasing their gifts what percentage of your gifts have you finished shopping for    tfw im 85 done picking items for my giftees and just have to wait for them to arrive at my sss place maybe i shouldnt have rushed and bought all at once
ive pretty much got all my gifts ordered just waiting for it all to arrive so i can arrange it into a nice package     im in the 3040 tier and my total comes up to about 55 right now and that doesnt include the upcoming shipping costs c
  ive ordered everything thats coming from outside the country im going to wait until it arrives before i buy anything that has a 12 day shipping time so i can spread the cost and afford to spoil if things take a while
im still making lists of what to get have an actually purchased anything yet but im not too worried as it still early
i have all my cheaper filler things bought but i am still looking for main items for my gifts     both my matches have quite specific tastes so i am trying to find something perfect for them
i tried to get a bit of everything interestwise for my match i had a lot of fun searching and found some things that really gave me that oooh this feeling     im really feeling the fun in being someones secret santa if all goes well this year ill definitely join next time as well
  have at least half of the shopping done for my match and plan to finish the rest in mid november i want to get my match some nice brand but their sizing is kind of tricky and everytime i find something that i think might work its way over budget which is fine that makes it fun to hunt around and i know ill find something eventually    the person who got matched with me was supposed to contact me and send me their questions but theyve never even given a peep despite asking for help and i still dont know what they want help with all can say on that end is welp hope theyre doing okay because ive tried reaching out hahaha still open to contact but cant force them to do it lol
my darn anxiety is flaring up since my initials havent been posted i just want some peace of mind ya know
  same maybe youre form was thorough enough that they dont need any help i wish i could hear something from my match too
very nice
  thats what im most worried about my brain turned to mush and all i could think of what i liked was my goth shit
2469 and 2181 if you are the ones worrying about your giftee not posting dont be worried your forms were very informative so i didnt have any questions 
secret santa for jm from canada here i am currently ordering gifts but i was wondering if you also wear bonnets and/or other types of headwear i hope youll be happy with what i find for you
thoughts on buying your match something from their wishlist i usually like to be creative with gifts so i feel disappointed in myself but im tossing up between buying a piece my giftee might like or something that theyd definitely like on their wishlist thats cheaper
  hey santa anon i hope theres only one jm in canada im id 2407 if youre talking to me id love more headwear im not all that fond of bonnets probably my least favourite type but i love flat hats any kinds like rococo and edwardian style big and small brims and of course more headbows clips or barrettes are very welcome since theyre easy to wear everyday but overall dont sweat it too much ill appreciate the effort put into anything you give
  i personally think that if you can find something that was on their wish list go for it especially if its an item that is harder to find or has come up secondhand etc they put it on there for a reason on my wish list i had lots of items that were out of print/ not being made any more so if an anon found it that would be great and even if not it would be great to get something you know theyll love
  sorry for the late response but thats good to hear im trying to collect lots of cute legwear and accessories for you
4328 jl from ak do you have any preferences or issues with scent i know some people get really irritated by certain scents or just overly strong scents so i dont want to get you something thatll just make your nose sad  also whats your hot drink of preference and if you like tea what kind
i havent seen my id or initials posted and i just want to know if everything is aok with my match and that they dont need any help i know some people here will twist their panties over it and clutch their pearls over tradition but dead silence doesnt put my mind at ease at all
  the only scents i dislike are lillies and musk i think thats what its called if a scent is too strong i get a little headache but its not serious for teas i enjoy fruit blends and earl gray not a fan of coconut or chamomile though thank you for asking
yl from canada i just found a ring youll like but i need to know your ring size so it fits you just right
  2922 here sorry if i sounded quite vague i filled the form while i was at work if you have any questions ill be checking the thread  im sure whatever you get ill love it
  oh gosh im believe im between 9 and 95 about 62mm as i do a quick double check away from home and sometimes wear rings over gloves so 95 would be most comfy thank you so much santa
  i actually got 1 of the things my match would like to get and then found something that i think they will like im also finding small knick knacks to throw in there as well    also im originally one of the 2347 from the previous thread but i found out im actually 5911 just wanted to check in and if my santa needed any questions answered im happy to reply
6800 ks from nz  can i ask do you like cute things like sanrio rilakkuma pokemon ghibli etc and if so which ones/characters are your favourites and who are your favorite idol girls from imcg ll lls    3862 lt and 3845 ss  do you like ghibli and who would be your favorite characters/shows/films etc from ghibli and other media do you also like animals and which ones and any cute/specific things
  ss here i love pom poko and i love cats and dogs and really all animals but mostly cats i also really like cute witchy pins
  is that a harry clarke illustration
  yes hes my favourite artist
  got it   hope you like it i may as well send your gift a tad earlier than sugested since my countrys postal system sucks a little
  you spoil me i look forward to it ive kept and still use almost everything i get from my secret santas theyre always so thoughtful
hi im trying to get in contact with my match hana from chicago to give her better info about my wishlist as it appears my link didnt go through i already emailed santa for your email but no response
  lt here  honestly ive only seen two ghibli films not that im not a fan ive just never gotten around to watching them so i wont really appreciate ghibli merch    my favourite animal is the wombat followed by the platypus  but thats a pretty niche thing to find anything on i also think rail stuff is pretty neat
how do people feel about an expensive jewelry piece with cute little add ons vs a main piece  because ive found a wishlist item for my giftee but its pricy and i feel like just getting a necklace is silly for 5075 tier
  6800 here i definitely like cute things my favourite sanrio character is my melody pokemon are chansey blissey latias espeon and dratini for idorus its rin shibuya and kaede cg hanayo ll and hanamaru and kanan llss i like most pink things if that helps d
  if its something she really wants it should be fine as long as you package it nicely and include some small things on top of it candy tea and ofc include a card     main piece for up to 75 tier is already spoiling the giftee unless its taobao no
3603 mm from aus whats your favourite characters from the animes you listed i dont want to get the wrong figurines/merch etc
damn just found this new thread you shouldve post link to it in previous one 
trying to get in contact with my match and santa and the helper and noone has responded hana pls respond i need your email for multiple things sizing etc
  shes probs a grinch
  are you sure youre using the right email address
  theres no email address given for my match ive posted in this thread and she answered before and hasnt since i contacted the helper via their button in the email they sent contacted twice in case and made sure it sent
    sorry we have both only seen your email in the last couple of hours please give us time to respond you sent it less than a day ago and are already in the thread saying no one has responded these are secondary emails please understand we only check them once or twice a day and get back to you when we can    i can assure you your match has received your wishlist link as the entirety of the form your filled out was sent directly to them so please dont worry     also please refrain from using a persons full name and their area directly on the board as this can very easily single people out and make them known to others this is why initials and ids have been being used     i have contacted your match directly and asked them to contact you in this thread or via email please keep in mind this is not a fast board and responses can take a few days for someone to see it
  my email address    
  sorry about that i had sent multiple emails for multiple days because i seem to have an issue with emails not going through to you guys and it happened earlier with me only to be notified about it from the email server two days later thanks for replying
ive had some bits arrive for my giftee and i forgot how bad i am at wrappingoops
id 2469 from wa and id 2181 from pa im going to london on vacation and im also going to be doing some shopping at hyper japan are there any particular weird london things or uk artists you like that i should grab you something from
i am almost done assembling my gift     ps sorry dear ns i suck at wrapping _
im moving in a month it was a surprise for various reasons its nothing huge just to another part of the city i was in  i looked into it and it seems i can get mail/packages sent to me at my new address no problem if i pay for it but id rather not can i contact the mods about this or is it too late to make a change i havent received anything yet
  since i have not received any proof of shipment from anyone and its early enough in the event id say its pretty safe to just send santa organizer and i your new address and we will update your santas
canada gulls  how strict are your customs with checking the value of packages i am planning to list all items with lower prices than reality could i get in trouble for this    i know its international law etc etc but do they actually check several items inside are nwt
  if it looks like it comes from a private person and not a company they dont generally check   make sure to wrap everything nicely so it becomes especially clear that its a gift just in case they somehow decide to check what the contents are after all  gift wrapping should put them off
  yep everything is wrapped in pink polka dot paper and flowery tape i hope it will be ok
  ohohoho im so excited thats okay im sure its not too bad and very cute looking forward to it      yeah basically what the other anon said as long as its declared as a gift and the items or package is obviously for christmas or wrapped they dont really care ive never had any wrapped gifts or even stuff marked as gifts get hit with customs or even inspected
  2181 here i cant think of any london specific things really but i do like most of the brands dreamy bows carries if that helps at all
  not very strict especially if you send via regular post ie not private couriers since im assuming youll be sending from a residential address i doubt theyll be interested in it when there are easier and more lucrative fish to catch
br from az i finished shopping for you im probably going to hold off on shipping maybe add some more small things but i really hope youll like everything
i sent out my international gift just now did anyone else ship theirs out yet    i know its a bit early but i wanted it to arrive before the mess of christmas season
im curious how are people managing to get gifts out already no judgement or offence or anything im just amazed  so many of my gifts have to come from overseas and will take ages and it took me about a week to find what i wanted to even buy
  i am the poster before you i am mostly able to do it because my match made a very informative form and i knew what i wanted to get them almost right away after reading it they also have very similar tastes to mine up to a point when at the start i wasnt sure if its my form or hers    i bought most of the contents of the gift box the day i received the match    i am also lucky the orders i made online came in rather quickly
i just bought the last of my matchs gift im going to cry if what i got them doesnt fit it should because i checked but sometimes shit happens so i wont be offended if they sell it theres other gifts in there of stuff i think shed like just in case i tried to spoil her a bit so i hope all goes well havent sent the gift out yet since i dont plan to till just after thanksgiving but im really excited
  i took a little while to find and pick gifts but it didnt really take that long overall it was like  1 week to pick gifts could have been shorter but one giftee had taste in dresses that was hard pin down  1 week for them to arrive at ss or for me to buy them from local shops  1 week for things to arrive from japan  and thats it theyre pretty much here i just need to gift wrap them and package them up
i got my ideas and purchases in pretty quickly say the week of getting the form sjust that shipping to my country takes forever so im still waiting on everything to arrive excited to get it all in and turn it into a pretty package
  from previous secret santa experiences i knew i had to buy the gifts as soon as i received the form if i have any hopes of it arriving on time without splurging on more expensive shipping i think i bought most of my gifts about a week from when we received the forms
im still waiting on my stuff to arrive in the one from japan is in ny customs now and the other should be shipping or has shipped from south korea any day now
all my packages have been shipped already but it      shipping to my country takes forever  so im still waiting for them
quick question to anons in mexico or canada  would you advise marking down the value of parcels even those that will be marked as gifts below a certain value just wondering what the threshold might be that you will have to pay customs/tax also is the cost of postage included in the tax because it costs an actual small fortune to send anything with tracking and i dont want it to contribute
  i asked earlier in the thread about canada  they dont really care if its gifts and from a residential address i did mark it down to about half its value though hopefully it doesnt matter in the end
  leaf here usually they dont care to check if its from a residential address but to be safe its legally feesfree when its under 60 canadian dollaroos and marked as a gift
    oh and no postage doesnt count towards that limit the 60 is regarding what you mark as the total value of the items inside
just a reminder that its 11/11 if you were waiting for a sale to get things for your giftee
mr from israel i just received the tracking number from santa so excited to receive it ill let you know when it arrives but ill probably open it closer to christmas if thats okay with you i say probably because i dont know for sure if ill be able to wait ahaha thank you so much
  update for 2181/kz from pa  the gift from japan has arrived sooner than expected i got to pick it up at the post office they require a signature the one coming from south korea is scheduled to arrive on friday if everything is good to go would you like me to go ahead and send it out early to avoid the rush and/or possibility of weather i dont know if you guys are getting hit with snow yet or not
2839 5135 5911 if any of you are worrying about your santa not saying anything in the thread sorry that is me i have been searching and searching for gifts so i hope you will like them    i likely wont get them sent until closer to the deadline as there is still stuff i am buying and waiting on but thought i would update you all incase
  many thanks for the update ill be patiently and eagerly awaiting then
  kz here we havent had snow yet or anything but you can certainly ship early if youre ready whenever is convenient for you is good to me honestly no rush at all im excited though youve been impressively quick
hey ns from va i do have a small question i dont know much about idol stuff but i do know they change outfits a lot not saying im 100 going to get you something nozomi still looking but if i did are there outfits she wears that you really dislike wouldnt want to get a figure with the worst outfit or something
  thats completely fine i kind of expected you to wait since i ended up getting it together so early santa said i was the first to ship    i will await patiently for your reaction once you do decide to open it
  hello santa i own pic related and the only ones i dont like are cheerleader china dress its this short qipao one with a black petticoat and her hair is in braids and the one in my reply to this post by the way im going to be out of town from december 21st to the 26th so if it would get delivered during that time frame i dont mind if you wait until after christmas to send or you can email me at above and ask me for an alternate address sorry if thats an inconvenience
  thanks again santa
  dont like cheerleader  hhaha im glad i asked in my defense that fig looks like it has nice details and good quality but so glad i asked    pretty much have almost everything picked actually if shipping is nice to me i should get it shipped to you before then but if not ill update you on here when the time comes    i should ask though cant believe it almost slipped my mind do you already own any homura figs theres several i was weighing but i dont want to get you a repeat not trying to reveal my gift or anything but id rather make sure
  thanks for the update
  oh my gosh no i appreciate you asking i own these two but thats it i have a mishmash of a lot of characters but barely any of waifus because i love grab bags at conventions haha im so excited thank you so much for putting so much thought into this
  thank you for the notification you do not have to be worried good luck with post and shopping
  2469 with a late reply  nothing specific comes to mind but i love me some twinings perfect afternoon 
my first gift ordered from aliexpress arrived yesterday which is quicker than i expected i hope the rest arrives soon i might be able to ship earlier than expected which would be so nice
  when did you order
    on the 27th of october due to my time zone i got my match on the 22nd and it took me a little time to figure out exactly what to buy also i got paid that day so i spoiled a little
i think at this point ive given up on seeing my id in thread or being contacted tried going through helper gull awhile back and they were more than happy to help so im just going to assume my form was thorough enough and hope i dont get grinched or something haha
  i just concern more about make happy my giftee rather than get some gifts by myself after all i can buy everything i actually need by myself but i cant buy gratitude in the same easy way
  reposting for this thread with initials this time just in case  ss from ky
  i mean if i were in the 100 tier itd be kinda concerning cause then itd show the person was only in it to get gifts themselves rather than give so id be pissed if i were grinched your post made me smile btw anon hope you have a good holiday i cant wait to see everyone post their gifts
  maybe you filled your form out enough my matches had a lot of info in them so i didnt feel the need to reach out   if any of you are id 4328  4763 5998 then youre alright from me
  wait to be in 100 tier you need successfully participate before isnt it too deep plan to grinch somebody for puny 100 once in a year not even knowing what will you get cmon anon you overthinking about it
  5998 here glad i gave enough info i always worry that im not thorough enough
  i understand anon ive got three giftees so i assume i have three santas and i havent heard from any one of them im not mad just a little disappointed its not going to affect my buying for my giftees though its just nice to hear from your santa with a hey id 9999 youre in good hands
  i hope i gave my santa enough info i have not tried to contact my match or my santa         i wouldnt worry this is my first secret santa and it kind of weirded me out that everyone seemed to be talking to there matches
  you were the easiest one to shop for outta my bunch im already done with you lol
  ohhh my god it arrived and im so excited the box is like the size of my torso i cant believe it   ive had a really crazy busy week so this is such a treat  thank you very much and ill be sure to post in here when i open it
  yaaay im so happy to know it arrived safely looks like the box suffered a bit but i packed everything carefully so it should be fine    i hope you will enjoy it
found a cute bowtie for my /ss/ i just hope she likes it
  bow ties are cute especially with brand blouses or peter pan collars if shes the type that likes kind of hip and trendy clothes and accessories im sure shell like it
  personally i think its adorable its aatp if i were more in to lolita id probably buy it for myself
id 7078  are you allergic to anything
looking to add some sweets to my gift going to the uk do yall really hate american chocolate or is that a stereotype
  uk anon here i think thats just a stereotype quite a few supermarkets here stock american chocolate and sweets now
  im in the uk and i love american chocolate but it doesnt taste like chocolate to me i think its just a stereotype but i can get how people who like dark chocolate or dont have a sweet tooth dont like it
  maybe ask your giftee if they like milk or dark chocolate plain or with stuff in it no way to blind guess this without asking
       thanks all   its definitely not part of the main gift but just in case   id 4821 any favorites
 thats me  im this anon too  i like hersheys and reeses but im always up for trying something new
  nope thanks for asking 
  just wanted to make sure before i baked anything ill include the recipes too
2181 your last gift finally arrived today im hoping to ship everything out on monday if not then then it would be the next week since i work everyday this coming week retail life sucks
so how badly is canadapost fucking my fellow leafs over this holiday
  personally not at all which is surprising im the one who received their package already and it didnt have any charges with it ive also been receiving ems and airmail packages of varying declared values and even the 100 ones havent gotten hit with customs kind of surprising but hey ill take it
  i am so jelly i once ordered something 3 over the taxable amount and ofc they held it up and i had to pay a processing fee on top of that     the customs in canada seem to be very chill like the rest of the country
  they probably are eyeing that massive backlog hopefully that means theyll be more leniant with items over the limit in order to speed things up
  i never get hit with customs with ems theyre my saviours
im shipping my stuff out next week and cant wait for match to get her package im shit at wrapping though but hey im sure other people are too im getting excited
shame i didnt get matches that are into riverdale ugh why am i making fan stuff for this teen trash when im practically a boomer imsoaddictedtocolesprouse
  i tried a few shops and wasnt able to find it but i got you some other tea that i hope you will like 
found what i hope is the perfect small gift for my ss
  it was not until now that i realise what you meant by this now with japan post saying they have suspended service to canada i have a bunch of items just sitting with my ss hooo boy this will be interesting fingers crossed this will be resolved before the international shipping deadline
  thats so super sweet of you anon i cant wait 
ns from canada  ill be sending your gift in two parts one ill ship soon from japan the second one ill ship from my home country rather next week or this one hope its okey for you
  mexican anon here they really dont mind but is better if you mark down the package just in case
  not that anon but japan post has halted all shipments from japan to canada because of the strike
  i think its ok if she uses ems or an independent shipping service im not 100 sure but i think thats the case
  ems gets handled by canada post once it reaches canada so thats an option but it will probably take longer than they estimate because of the backlog of mail we currently have    dhl should be fine in theory but your giftee will get charged a bunch for the brokerage because dhl sucks so that probably isnt a great option
canada post has released a statement saying their current backlog of mail is going to take months to sort and send on its way so any gulls mailing from any country to canada or even within canada are fucked at this point
7078  can you wear wool acrylic or is that a no go too
  i just sent you an email sorry for the super slow response
  unless they use another postal service private courier items leaving canada dont have it as bad so im mostly worried for the items coming in
  even some private couriers are handled by canada post ems immediately switches to canada post when it reaches the country and ups is handled by canada post outside of major cities
  ems isnt private as far as i know ups fedex puralator dhl are the private couriers in canada but yes even private couriers will hand off to canada post in rural areas so people living in those are kinda screwed until the strike is over those with canadian giftees might want to contact their recipients to ask which service delivers in their area
  ns here thats definitely okay i personally dont mind if its late and if you have tracking you can keep an eye on it thank you so much for letting me know im looking forward to it dont worry too much about paying for a private courier service also        one good thing is that the employees are working just albeit very slowly and no overtime or weekends i think there is a possibility where it could be resolved before december but at this point who knows       im going to look into having my packages possibly shipped from the usa since the drive to the border is only about 35 hours and i have a family member in the us who i could use as the return address for customs will keep giftees posted if i do this
jeez i dodged a bullet therei am the anon whose gift was delivered already to a canada gull     good luck to the rest of those sending to canada ill have my fingers crossed the strike ends soon
canadian anons shipping to the us look up if theres a chitchats near you
el from va sh from fl ns from alberta and kd from tx i just sent your cards hope they reach all of you in time
  ill send it to my home country and ship all together
  
i just need 2 more things to come in the mail and then i can get started on turning it into a neat lil wrapped package already got some cute christmas themed wrapping paper ready to pretty it all up 
  late reply but yeah if its really soft im not usually a sweater person if that changes anything
just placed an order for my 100 anon  cant wait to wrap everything up
made the address change request if anyone has 6791 wait a bit on sending stuff

  i ordered some stuff on mercari right away yet theyre still not here yet thanks canada post
  i ordered two things off aliexpress the day after we got matches and theyre still not here and its eating me alive i could just cut my losses but i know with my luck theyll arrive the day after i post the package
 still waiting for x or y nerves    so soothing knowing im not the only one    just now i finally messaged an etsy seller about a sticker sheet that was shipped a full month ago another aliexpress purchase  a big item that counts for like half my package value is taking over a month now i so feel everyones pain this is stress i really dont need
is anyone leaving their pricetags on their new bought items or is that a nono not in the sense of dont show your match what you paid but like i personally like brand tags and im wondering if my match wouldnt like to keep them too for the brand logo and theres also a sticker of the brand logo etc
    i kept all the tags i think its fair for example if they dont like the items which i hope will not be the case but what if they can sell it as nwt
  oh thats a good thought too that didnt even occur to me ill leave them on then
3263 i received a card from you today i open my ss gifts on christmas eve so ill be sure to post it then thanks 4821
  i dont remove tags but l cross out the price
  hmm wouldnt that make it look unnecessarily suspicious like i dont want you know how much this cost personally i wouldnt care for the specific costs of each item but if the price was crossed out that would actually make me more curious
id 2504 and 7092 i am just checking in to let you know i am getting your packages ready and will ship next week 
  its just gift etiquette im sure you can look up the price online later anyway but its a little tacky to leave the price on as it indirectly proclaims heres exactly how much money i spent on you and i hope you reciprocate
just a reminder there is just over 2 weeks left to send out your package    if anyone is having any issues or think they may be late/ delayed shipment definitely let us know as we will deal with it case by case
8640 ill be sending your package out next weekend ill give santa the tracking number once i get it in the mail i hope it gets to you before christmas and that you enjoy it
  yeah its basic gift etiquette     did your parents not teach you anything 
oh dear ive gone overbudget in the lowest tier and ended up spending at least 60 so far hopefully my anon loves it
   heres exactly how much money i spent on you and i hope you reciprocate    thats exactly what i want to avoid my thought was to put a cute sticker over the back of the label so i think ill do that     ive never sent a gift bought directly from a lolita brand before normally i always remove tags but the thought that my match would maybe like the labels is what started my original question        you want a participation trophy for third party with unnecessary comment or sth
  im glad sorry it arrived so early i didnt want to risk it getting caught up in the xmas post hell
  well im not buying from this etsy seller again     hey i ordered this a full month ago could i get an update or sth    first reply its international it might take even longer lemme know if you havent gotten it in a week     i still find it weird that a sticker sheet is taking over a month tho ive ordered internationally plenty times    second reply now oh yeah its definitely strange it would usually take a week or 2 weeks at most    ok so you agree this is absurd yet still have me wait another week
  are you or the seller in canada
  nope id be way more understanding then since i know about the chaos there    seller is from texas im in europe
  no but i want you to know that youre an uneducated fuck and 4chan is 18
may i ask a bit advice about sending card ive ordered my at etsy and i thought it would be just a flat card but it turned to a booklike something as attached picture so which is better way to send it i can cut its face side and send like regular card or i can put it as is in envelope and send like a letter  as postcrossing enthusiast i can tell the flat naked card have its own charm when you find it in your postbox though using envelope i can add some more fancy stuff that would rather fall off otherwise so im a bit confused which way is more common for secret santas events im participating for the first time
  thanks for the laugh 
  i would put it in an envelope would prevent it from getting dirty or damaged
  there are actually some disappointing sellers at etsy today ive finally got the final item for my gift it was traveling over month from the moment when my order was marked as shipped on etsy few days before ive even asked the seller about it and what can he tell me about package timings the reply was like idk lol you used cheap shipping without tracking number so enjoy your waiting it also could be just lost haha deal with it  and today i got my package and i look at shipping date and i see 11/14/2018 there and i understand it was shipped only two weeks ago in other words that man actually brought his ass to the post office two weeks later after he marked my order as shipped im still very mad about it i actually thought i would be forced to send incomplete gift without this main item at least he could mark the order as shipped when it was actually shipped  at least that would be fair
  man that is such an unprofessional way to run a business thats one of the dangers of etsy dealing with people instead of a company when you review you should definitely rate him accordingly    my seller also gave me the you went with cheapest shipping so theres no tracking spiel but im mostly salty about the backtracking they pulled admitting that it should take only two weeks and still making me wait another week when ive explicitly said it was for a christmas present     saying aww lemme know in a week and ill try again feels like theyre pulling the fake customer service voice on me even if they send it asap after i let them know that nope still not here it could again take up to two weeks which makes it really tight schedule and im not about that stress    its just one stickersheet but it still irks me cause i ordered it over a month ago and now theres a chance i wont get to add it to the rest on top of that my aliexpress item is also still not here i dont want to send half the package out next week and the other half later i was so hype about this and now at the last stretch im getting all this stupid stress ugh    rant over sorry
    anon its holiday rush season its absolutely the worst time for mail altogether so it makes sense that things would take longer once a seller ships something and you didnt pay for tracking its really out of their hands nontracked items are often nonpriority and get pushed to the back burner it really isnt the sellers fault here ive shipped things for domestic mail recently and had trouble with the post office not scanning tracking on time so it looks like they received my items days after i dropped them off at the post office i understand your frustration and stress but its really misguided theres nothing the seller can do to make your items show up faster
  ive had shitty lm sellers send me tracking and then not actually take the item to the post office until weeks later after telling me oh i did send it i sent you the tracking number
  i really hope you like everything
anon i need an advice some etsy sellers put additional stuff to their orders like stickers or pins they are pretty cute though completely unrelated to other gift ideas what should i do add them to gift so the more stuff makes better or keep gift strongly requestrelated so it be highly personalized
  thats entirely up to you for example i decided to keep the additions to myself because like you said they werent really related to the rest of the gift i wanted to keep it cohesive
    hello santa we have an issue   me and this anon have the same id
  god i hate the mess with ids this year ive called my gifties for some questions and had no reply and im afraid they just didnt realize i was talking to them because of wrong ids    well let the secret santa be secret at its best i hope at least the addresses are distributed correctly so everybody actually have their gifties and santas
  yeah i tried reaching out to my giftee a few times but no reply i really want to make her something truly special
    i had not been in a /cgl/ ss before and i was weirded out by how much communication there was i never wanted to contact or be contacted i just happened to check the thread and noticed we had the same id my worry is that the addresses are mixed up as well lets hope it all works out since i plan to send my gift this week
  agreed the addresses mess would be a real thing
  im putting mine in an envelope because im sending a print with it basically spoiling my card match cause i felt like it
    cards generally go in envelopes postcards are what dont
   cards generally go in envelopes   postcards are what dont  er may i ask you to show the difference between card and postcard in pictures english nonnative struggling here again d i thought it is the same according to wikipedia
  postcards have a place for a stamp cards are just wellcards you can send postcards just as is
  holiday rush to me is like mid novemberdecember not something bought 23th of october 2 days after i got my match and said to be shipped on the 25th of october     but i did totally expect it to take longer than normal anyway which is why i ordered it like instantly and for a small thing like a single sticker sheet normally 12 week shipping time an extra week or two is a realistic expectation i gave it a full month basically having it arrive mid november would have been fine     so now waiting well over a month and then getting two very different replies from the seller is imo enough cause for some venting here ok     i know they cant magically pull tracking out of nowhere but customer service being let me know in a week and ill try again after also being told its a christmas gift is very disappointing
  cant you send cards as is too in your country not assaulting just curious if you dont mind in my you just need to meet some measurements restrictions put appropriate stamp on it in specified place top right corner write address and you go so in my language there actually no separate terms for card and postcard you can send any piece of paper with our postal service if you put stamp on it
   customer service being let me know in a week and ill try again  wait what exactly they would try again in a week i read all your posts and cant get this thing there is nothing they can do if there is no track and they actually have sent it isnt it
  i would leave a negative review i live in the us and used to sell charms every time ive shipped to europe shipping has only taken 2 weeks max through international first class mail maybe even shorter through international first class package     idk why that seller didnt use tracked shipping either tracked usps shipping is pretty fucking expensive at higher weights but for something that only weighs a few ozs it shouldnt be expensive either its like 5 max
  that is a direct quote aka ill try again is literally what they said to me i took it as ill send another sticker sheet if you havent gotten it in a week     thing is the item in question is out of stock on their shop so idk if they can even send me another       ive had stores email me tracking info with the thanks for ordering message when ordering a single 35 little sticker for an ita bag now i didnt ask for tracking either so ill say its partly on me too i just honestly didnt expect to have to track a sticker sheet at all
  how much did you pay for shipping it sounds like they sent it out with just a stamp on it in an envelope usps first class is 350 and includes tracking by default
  shipping was 3
  i double checked and 2926 is the id i was sent as my fixed id soo thats definitely an issue hopefully santa can figure out whats up with that
  a card has a fold and will then have an outside and an inside a postcard is just a flat piece
woot i have the present for my match all ready to wrap and send just need to compose a note to go with it so keen for them to get it and also so keen to see what my match gets me
hope my anon likes bourbon balls and bourbon buckeyes and strawberry rum truffles
  unrelated to the rest of the convo but as someone with an etsy store i send everything with tracking because thats the only proof we the seller have that something was delivered
          ffs that is me again the addresses will be correct but i have apparently copy and pasted the same email to both of you like a genius    the original issue was that every time we signed in and out of the organised form it regenerated all of the ids thanks google so everyone got given completely different ids from what i wrote on the forms than what you received in the emails so youre santas have the correct ids/ addresses as i did this all in one log in for sheets just i sent the wrong ids to people as this was done over a couple of days so multiple logins    to clarify    jg you are actually id 7093  cc you are the real id 2926    i thought i had fixed this fuck up but your emails were right next to each other when i went through them all again so i guess i sent the same thing to each of you ugh    my apologies for the 20th time
  thanks for sorting that out santa and also for organizing this whole thing
  how to become such nice and patient person like you
id 2469 from wa whats your measurements bust/chest  waist hip in inches 
id 2181 from pa i also need your measurements bust/chest waist hip in inches
  2181 here   b 36  w 30  h 39
  ty ty hopefully will have your package out today
  oh while you are here i just noticed that your form says you dont want tights unless they match your aesthetic very well i was planning on giving you some tights they are printed similar in style and palette to cherrycheezys yumekawaii/pastel menhera stuff     is that ok or would you rather something else and if it is ok do you prefer pink or lavender
how did the bloodbath go on friday night gulls
  site was down for nearly two hours after it was supposed to go up managed to get a two day vip ticket in my cart but it sold out before i could actually buy it
didnt get shit after babysitting my phone for almost two hours i wish they would have just canceled and set a new time like cyber monday so everyone could try again
as fall is approaching its time for the yearly thread all about the nature inspired styles    where to buy  pretty much everywhere but thrift and vintage stores are recommended search term for taobao would be 森女    colours work with it    
are there any active ig/tumblrs that post mori and related fashion
  there seem to be quite the amount if active personal mori coord blogs in the tag but besides those      
  end mini dump sorry most of these are kind of simple anons i just pulled what i had off my general style inspiration board
  naturally i forget to attach my last image lol
is there even any way to wear this kind of fashion if you live in a hot climate i feel like i only see tons of heavily layered outfits with long sleeves cardigans and scarves
  yeah i also live in a hot climate i wear a light flowy dress with some sort of lace overshirt shawls with thin fabric pretty sandals and floral accessories mori doesnt have as strict rules as lolita you dont always have to look like youre ready to go to antarctica as long as you have the forest dweller aesthetic you should be alright
  some inspo for hotter weather
  most of these are just old pics from previous threads sorry if you recognize some of them
  ive always wanted to try this type of style but my worries about the color palette are holding me back i have black hair with a very cool leaning skintone asian and i find that many of these colors especially fern and eggshell in the second pic look like shit on me and totally wash me out i usually wear lolita in rich jewel tones for reference ive also noticed that everyone who wears this almost always has a warm brown or blonde hair color anyone have any suggestions on adapting this color palette for cool undertones i wouldnt be opposed to getting a brown wig sorry for being spoonfeedy
im looking for pieces fitting a kind of overlap between mori and classic lolita so lots of natural materials and texture but still structured bodices and poofy skirts so far ive been collecting older innocent world pieces but id like to branch out are there any good quality taobao brands that consistently produce this style ive looked into miss point but apparently their quality isnt so good or has been going downhill part of my attraction to this style is that i want to have more durable pieces that will last me many years
is natural kei popular in japan right now i feel like im seeing a lot more kaneko isao/pink house/ingeborg etc in closet child and other second hand sites than i used to
  likely because natural colors are popular around fall
wtb this skirt seems to be sold out on aliexpress and taobao
  can someone help out a newb gingritch here what is this brands name    i keep seeing their photos and i love every piece they have a very unique style
  im not 100 sure its theirs but the stock photo reminds me of favorites pics whether it is or isnt theirs they do have quite a few pieces that can work for these styles
ive found that people interested in mori arent really interested in forming communities like we have for other jfashions or at least those communities arent too active i guess because most of us are solitary   but still it would be nice if we could organize an exchange im sure lots of other people into this fashion share snail mail/postcard exchange as a hobby no    on instagram there are quite a few people into mori girl if you search the tag morigirl morikei morilifestyle naturalkei youll find lots of beautiful accounts there seems to be a lot of enthusiasts from russia for some reason here are some accounts of people who are inspiring to me even if some dont post too many outfits    kesstiel   wistwarbler  forestsandtea  frillycakes  nekono_morihime  theowlandherbluebell  kuri_marmalade  tanubecky  witching_and_stitching  wildflowersandweeds  petite_madeline  thymian_  dolly_the_sun_gazer  katie_theodorus  hazelwitchy  madame_momerath
  i would just transfer your favorite color palette from lolita to natural kei anon while its popular to use washed out colors for a more ethereal look i see plenty of outfits in regular and dark mori that use dark fall colors and jewel tones beautifully     i think              are all pretty good examples but honestly you could take any coord in this thread and recreate it in a richer palette to good effect as long as you stick to the silhouette and materials
  thanks for the help anon ill give it a shot for now ill collect inspo of darker coords
  lol this is pretty much me in winter except not outside and mostly out of necessity upnorthliving
i see mori girl more as a daily fashion than a special occasion fashion like lolita although i do know there are some lolitas that do wear their fashion daily    although i wouldnt mind talking to mori girls sometimes i dont think i would be part of a group i never felt fully part of anything that resembled the mori girl community or the lolita community i was always something in between and kind of got called out on it on both sides     op i am glad you did consider natural kei because i think that is the best fashion that describes me i wish there were more solely natural kei girls out there maybe then i will be interested in joining a community     brands that i normally wear are pink house kaneko isao and sweet dreamer
  hhhng
i didnt have to start this thread and it didnt die immediately such a pleasant feeling here are some paste things     the mori music playlist add songs you think should be on there      i just found someone made a google drive as an archive of old mori magazine scans here     and it was from this blog which seems to have a lot of nice resources     what would it take to start a mori com im sure everyone still interested in it is too far flung for meetups but i would really enjoy a forum dedicated to just chatting maybe we could start a mailing list     also pic related is a screenshot of me because i dont know how to save things from my friends instagram
  bless you anon for that drive link you made my whole week now
    does she have insta
    awesome links do you have your own insta id be interested in a mori comm myself
  she has a wear account and her insta is linked there but doesnt seem to work     
  checked her insta and it seems to be working again but shes not posted in a while
  see above  a biiig list of mori instagrammers
question for the thread where would i be able to get mori style for men in western sites
    i wish i could help you more with this im a dude and i dont order my clothes online  i have to try them on first i generally find my stuff completely by random at the usual american stores and make the rest knitting and sashiko stitching helps me customize my wardrobe
  where is this picture from
ive never cared about fashion before but i lost weight and needed new clothes recently i inadvertently got into mori no idea what it even was until a few weeks ago the only issue is that i am a guy everthing is for gals what do i do mfw i wish i were a cute girl
  have you done any research at all guys can wear the style too you may have to be a bit more creative in where you find the garments and how you dress yourself but its possible and you dont need to be a girl to do it
  research so far has been looking at pictures its still harvest time so i am looking to buy stuff for fall when i have the time to wear nice things still wish i were a cute girl
  you clearly havent been looking very well then because simply googling mori kei male brings up a ton of examples maybe try just a little bit harder instead of whining in the thread about not being a girl
  i for got that mori girls are still just lolitas and are heartless and mean
  not the person who initially responded but jesus dude what were you expecting asspats handholding imagine doing this in any other hobby find an internet forum about girls tennis and ask lol do they have a boys version without taking 5 seconds to google it and then tell them all i wish i was a cute girl uwu and expect them not to feel fucking uncomfortable
  lolitas must be luvlies is out  why arent mori girls luvlies is in
  discord is quite popular now and has a great layout as a forum
i really like this style but some look like curtains
    i hate to be that person but i despise discord it has the absolute worst interface i think ive ever worked with
  hey there are some pretty cool curtains out there       either   find another one of the many dedicated threads to bemoan that you arent a cute girl  wear girls clothes anyways do you think the forest cares  look around a bit more youll find stuff that being said most of the wearable mens pieces ive found at thrift shops and such fall more under natural kei but it gets the point across       well shit lets start a comm on discord  i dont actually think that a majority of the people interested in mori would have a discord but hey who knows
  check out this shop on etsy      although most of their stuff is for women they have nice mens vests and plenty of unisex capes
  this is the spoonfeeding i was looking for thank you     also for all those that didnt pick it up the whole i want to be a girl thing is a joke welcome to /cgl/     i do feel sorry for lolitas that gotta deal with brolitas that is weird
  also for all those that didnt pick it up the whole i want to be a girl thing is a joke welcome to /cgl/  post dicc or gtfo we dont cater to your entitled ass crossboarding scum
anyone doing the mori lifestyle thing crafting cooking reading art music id like to know what other people into the style do
  if this were not a blue board i would post the dicc   i am a crossboarder though       im just starting to learn about the fashion but i do eat a lot of local organic produce i make my own bread as well as anything else i can make from scratch
    what other boards and what kind of bread do you make i do the noknead breads because theyre easy and i try to keep down the clutter in my kitchen as much as possible so as few pots/pans/tools as possible to get everything made i do a lot in just a french pot    if youre just starting out the color guides in the op are an easy to way to get going for a dude id suggest keeping it simple and adding things slowly
  /ck/ /k/ /out/    i make no knead breads as well sometimes i try to make my own sourdough starter with varying results     i have been thinking about getting a french pot / dutch oven any suggestion on what would work good for bread
    ive been using a tramontina ceramicenamel cast iron pot for several years now i believe its a 6 quart one it works great for so many things whole chicken soups bolognese sauce and large/small loafs of bread the lid keeps the steam in the pot so you still get a good crust i like to make a couronne loaf now and then and stick a ramekin with water in the middle to make it really crusty
  that sounds great ive never made a couronne before     i hope more people use the discord i used to hate discord but i have grown to like it more recently
  im trying to get more into art because mori has given me a lot of inspiration im still lazy af though when it comes to carrying through im also working on folk music    i have this dream of living in a little cottage growing my own vegetables and herbs and maybe eventually rescuing a couple of donkeys but the only place ive found within budget is on a busy highway and across from a trailer park      youre welcome man sorry for the misfire we can get a bit frustrated here because we seem to end up sharing the same images and links over and over with each thread id love to see some more original content and new mori girls and guys is integral to that
  i love making paper dolls its cute to give them all your clothes or design things youd like to have
  i adore them too do you have mori examples
  vintage and thrift stores are actually extremely common in the mori community id say theyre probably the first thing that is recommended when you ask for shops
  i do pretty much all of these except music i live near the beach so my life style is more hama than mori i hope to move out of my parents place somewhere up north with more nature
  i like walking in nature and im learning about plants/trees/etc in my area ive succesfully picked lemon balm and mint for my tea during autumn i was able to find some edible mushrooms as well but i need a good field guide and i havent found any so now i just use an app called plantnet to help me identify plants  i also love baking reading and swapping postcards
does anyone own this piece aliexpress/taobao stock it and im curious if the lace looks as good as favorites photos
  that sounds comfy as all get out i grew lemonbalm and mints in my container garden a few years ago but was too busy this year to do any gardening      i think itd be cool to see a more beachinspired version of mori style       when you find something you really like youll stick to it try out a bunch of things and see what sticks
  beachversion  supposedly thats what hama is anon
    never seen it
  when you find something you really like youll stick to it  i hope so im in that mindset of ill get everything done when i have my own space for it and thats an excuse    does anyone have mori friends what sort of things do you do together i like the idea of field expeditions like   can i call you botanyanon as a social activity
  my friends and i meet up at the local cider mill theyre a husband and wife what owns it wife is entomologist with state universitys working farm up here and theyve been making fresh cider from local apples for 10 years we each have our own thrifted mugs and sit around outside by the fire with our doggos and chat about local county news    we also go to the beaches together and gather rocks or go on hikes theres lots of local street festivals too i live in a concentrated rural area and were all pretty close we help each other and a lot of my friends and me cultivate gardens or own farms chickens etc ive helped a friend take care of her mini horse and mule     i have an instagram i dont mind giving out if you would like a window into my life anons
  nayrt but seems pretty comfy id like to move somewhere like that the city is getting to me let me know your instagram anon ill follow ya
    as a girl just lurking i appreciate these posts because i prefer more masculine clothes and didnt know this was an option thanks
    it was literally made up by one white tumblr chick its like dark mori it was just mori until someone decided they werent special enough for wearing that
  no problem mori style is lovely in all its forms and youre free to express yourself in it regardless of gender all it takes is creativity and willingness to take risks and experiment
    would love a peek into your awesomesounding life
    edante_chan
  yes please link your insta
  tfw i already follow you from some old mori thread     well then   id be interested in following some other people as well my insta is hypnone_i mostly post photos from my hikes or nature walks historical monuments and some baking stuff
  bless you anon thanks im gonna start collecting stuff closer to this especially with winter soon so excited
so where do you buy your clothes ive managed to find some stuff while thrifting but it has been quite inconsistent for base garments ive only found decent ones on taobao/aliexpress
  anywhere and everywhere really i like thrifting because its cheaper and mori is easily built off out of style clothes but i can find items at pretty much any nonspecialty store
  i get skirts from hippy stores because they tend to have natural fabrics and nice earthy colours unfortunately my favourite store has gone down the ive been to thailand  it was so enlightening route
  i like this more deserty looking photo itd be cool to see some more shoots like this
  asymmetric hems are difficult to find nowadays but apart from those most normie shops will have something suitable for mori i especially like zara its trafaluc collection has such lovely fabrics
does anyone know where to find tall leather boots as a guy ive been trying thriftshops and surplus stores but everything is in tacticool black or super ugly work boots these days im looking for something plain and brown and feel like there has to be somone who still makes simple boots that dont have a hundred bells and whistles
  dsw maybe orrrrr tractor supply farm and fleet its a stretch but they sell so much work clothes you could try
  look at lard and historical reenactment markets/webshops ask in the lard thread
    thanks for the tips never thought about reenactment stuff thats probably the perfect place to look ill give the tractor supply a peek though the one near me is pretty small so i doubt ill find anything worth a shot though
  mori is definitely more wearable than many jfashions natural kei is a bit on the upswing i think i wish there was a dolly kei comm all three of them seem like sister styles drawing from different areas  mori has lots of nordic influence natural kei has american prairie/english countryside and dolly has russian
    thats such a good observation thanks for posting that
  could anyone help my memory and tell me which brand that dress is from  i saw it on lolitawardrobe a few weeks ago but they dont sell it anymore and i cant for the life of me remember what it was called
  dolly is such a great fashion i dont have muched saved id love an image dump if any anons have a folder
  small dolly dump of all the usual ones ahoy
  and a few of these
  and a lovely drawing  end dump
  found a couple of others in another folder
  end dump for realsies
  dont forget cult party with more traditional kawaii influences
going to be brave and selfpost sorry for the strange pose haha how can i improve this coord i was thinking a more prominent necklace or a scarf would make it look a bit better any recommendations
  i think this looks cute but id choose a jacket with asymmetrical hems im not sure whether its the pose but the one youre wearing has a strange cut or maybe looks strange with the rest of the coord
  thank you and thanks for the advice asymmetry will make it look so much better the jacket is from the late 40s so its a bit nipped in at the waist
  yea i would go with a cute long knitted cardigan or something not so professional looking not that thats bad if that was what you were going for
  i sometimes feel like dolly kei is me getting dressed up  lul
  that jacket is too short for the look youve got going here and please please please moris do not put these fake plastic flower crowns in your hair     to make hair accessories i coil bits of hanging lace into my bobby pins and wear my hair very naturally and mussed it helps that i have texture and wave in my hair    a long white or beige cardi would work here anon especially one thats aran in knit pattern     that background garden is gorgeous where is that your garden
  thank you yall are so helpful    flower crown cheapness noted i do have some lacy hair clips that will probably work much better with the coord and thank you for the compliment on my backyard its literally just a backyard nothing too special it gets really green when it rains though so its perfect for picture taking    so long cardigan instead of short jacket throw some asymmetry in there and use nicer quality hair accessories thank yall so much for being so helpful
  other than the jacket those look like very versatile pieces so well done      what are peoples thoughts on jewellery is there such a thing as mori jewellery that doesnt look like it was made poorly on etsy  at the moment i wear a small antique silver locket but i dont like wearing the same thing every day
  bronze or wooden jewelry or maybe jewelry with fake flowers/insects is what i think of as mori jewelry      if the flower crown is well down i think its totally okay to wear one to be honest especially if the outfit has a spring vibe
    speaking of which theres a male jfash person i used to follow on tumblr i think he deleted his account he used to post cultparty coords with him and his friends i know this is not terribly specific but he was young and quite cute looked hispanic anyone know if hes still around really great outfits think he was a fashion student somewhere in cali
  aaaand heres the same coord with a sweater i thrifted yesterday i think it looks much better although i want to include more lighter layers get a better necklace and get a nice lacy headdress to wear with it cant thank yall enough
  did that sweater come with shoulder pads in it no offense intended if your shoulders are just that broad the proportions just look a bit off with how flowy everything else is
  nah just have broad shoulders haha of course it could be exaggerated due to layering i agree with the strange proportions though looks a little top heavy
  wait a minute just realized that i took the photo from an odd angle that could be part of it as well if you want to see my body type more accurately i have a photo pretty early on in the halloween thread just search christine if you want
    the new sweater makes it worse it makes your body look weirdly oblong and emphasises your wide shoulders what you need is a much shorter sweater or at least you need to do up a button near the top with your kind of figure you need something to draw the eye inward near the chest or waist basically personally id try something like pic related
    a loose belt like the left girl in  would be another option
  it looks lots better anon way to go i want to sit and have a picnic under that beautiful tree in your garden
    thanks so much for the suggestion i always struggle finding cardigans that work on me they make me look blocky half the time    thank you so much
bump
  dolly kei is based on the clothing worn in grimms fairytales meaning mostly traditional european clothing not russian    a lot of gyaru brands have morisuitable stuff atm or rather every fall
  the blablahospital guro brand designer got a mori phase atm
  nayrt and maybe off topic but from what i understood dolly kei uses very heavy clothes both physically and metaphorically with complicated or oldlooking patterns eg arabesques and thick fabrics such as velvet tweed and brocade there are many layers and details in a more is more philosophy overall the looks resemble that of an old doll in an antique shop so as i said this is what i think dolly kei is but nowadays i see a lot of light and flowy outfits tagged as dolly kei they remind me more of natural kei or mori kei have i got dolly kei wrong or has it somehow changed from when it was born
  have i got dolly kei wrong or has it somehow changed from when it was born  dolly kei was always based on traditional european clothing and grimms fairytales as stated by the coining brand grimoire
  ah im late to say this but thanks anon great images
  theres always been confusion probably a lot of the things tagged dolly would fit more as cult party or natural/mori
  youre welcome anon      has it somehow changed from when it was born  dolly kei is static so its inspirations and ideals arent evolving its effectively dead which is sad but on the other hand its distinct differences from mori and natural makes it less elitist than lolita with the old school and new school divisions   any anons still wearing it i havent touched it since 2008 but i still have my pieces
  but i still have my pieces    sell them lots of people love dolly kei
  any anons still wearing it i havent touched it since 2008 but i still have my pieces    i gave it a try a while ago but i still have to get the hang of it do you have any pictures of your old outfits id love to see them
  im thinking about it 10 years is a long time to hold onto something       it was well before i had a decent camera so i dont have any pics ill take some of my favourite pieces when i have time though dolly kei is a lot of fun  i hope you keep at it
    isnt it both i mean when i think fairytales i think hansel and gretel and baba yaga but i think dolly is kind of small but if there was more of it it could even be broken into substyles like how dolls vary a lot too
is there any brand that sells good quality customsized natural kei ops most ops from asian brands that fit my bust/waist are too small in the shoulders and arms people have directed me to miss point before but their quality seems meh im looking for good quality cotton pieces that hold up over time
i wish mori wasnt so dead
  it isnt though i have a lot of mori friends on ig and the tag is pretty popular facebook groups are moderately active where i live the mori aesthetic is not that uncommon and some people wear it without knowing the label mori isnt a very popular style but it definitely isnt dead either
    same where i live you can find people wearing low key mori all the time i only follow anything mori because i have apparently had one foot in the fashion for years
  i have a lot of miss point and its significantly nicer than my regular taobao stuff anon give it a shot
  id recommend the band charan po rantan to any anons into dolly kei their outfits arent always dolly kei bht their music is rly klesmer inspired and its so fun and imo rly fits the dolly mood
its the faun release season again  
    out of curiosity where do you two live
  what brand is that op from
  milu forest
  i live is super rural wi like the kinda place where you think your dog is walking up behind you and it turns out to be a deer    a lot of people seem to do an inadvertent mori look layers in the fall and winter natural colors fur and thick textured fabrics and a worn out pair of boots some people ruin it with a camo coat but it is hick country out here nobody is trying to be mori i have always tried to cultivate a natural camo in what i wear     we dont really have many clothes stores in the area so stuff is often worn out patched and faded     a lot of igs i follow seem to be from russia
  that must make a great backdrop for pictures
  it can be when its not terrible out also we have a lot of amish/menilites i forget which in my specific area so it kind of gives the area a weird aesthetic not exactly mori but more natural and old school
  
  sorry for the late answer i live in italy i remember an old teacher of mine who always wore mori as well as some of my mums colleagues sometimes i see people on the bus who wear it too i wouldnt say its the exact same version you see online but the aesthetic is extremely similar
  i imagine that everyone in the alps dresses mori just my head cannon
    these are so gorgeous
  yes her designs are beautiful  
im living in the mountains of fukushima for a short while and last night i met a girl at a party who was an actual reallive lifestyler  as in she works for a womens forestry society cooks with mountain wild plants and hunts mushrooms as a hobby shes not the first person ive met with that hobby of course she dresses in practical mori so cool id post pics but im not facebook friends with her and dont want to be a creep
i love mori but i live in a city so this is basically as close as i get urbanizing my outfit makes no sense to the mori lifestyle but i cant just move out any ideas to inserting a little natural touch into more outfits
  
  how about adding some knit like wearing an oversized open knit fest knit socks and the like
  i think a combination of light cotton and linen pieces would give you the right look without being a sweatlodge  has the right idea
  any anons still wearing it i havent touched it since 2008 but i still have my pieces    i absolutely love it and still try to collect it i feel like its way easier to combine with everyday wear and tone it down for work pic attached is my favorite piece in my collection
coeur de vague tends to be on the fancier side but im thinking of trying to incorporate one of their more naturalcolored dresses into a mori coord
  you do realize mori was born in tokyo right just wear the fashion   but if you feel like it isnt practical enough for you you can always get inspiration from postapocalyptic styles or strega and switch the color palette and fabrics around a bit   if im actually hiking or walking a lot i go with leggings hiking boots and then an assymetrical tunic and go with a piece that has fake layers instead of actually layering a bunch
  thats gorgeous anon where did you get that
  its fashion it belongs in the city it doesnt do much for us in the country mori just happens to kinda work in rural areas
  gonna add onto the dolly kei dump mixture of jfashion and inspired pieces
  dont know if this counts but seems like dollykei goth cross over
  love the textures in this picture
  last few pics are just general inspo for this thread
  id love to diy something like this myself
would anyone be interested in joining a mori discord server if there isnt one aldready and in that case i want to join i imagine that could be comfy most people that are into the fashion seem to be so nice i have never made a server before though but it doesnt seem too difficult
  i would be interested but not if i saw the link on cgl id worry the server would be full of drama like everything is in here
  anon thats amazing hearing about we makes me oddly happy
  anon its in this thread haha
    there is a discord check higher up in this thread its not very active but maybe you can join in and help that
found this cute store its pricey but their stuff looks gorgeous  
  what are these kind of pants called
  just based on the pic it looks like ゆるいパンツ is the term for baggy loose pants like that but i dont think theres any more specific of a title yurui pantsu yurui  easy relaxed baggy
  brown leather waist belt belt that matches your shoes would be a good addition i think a long cardigan could still work if it was longer a darker neutral colour and triangle shaped if that makes sense
  renfaire shops custom make boots that will definitely suit the mori look though theyre usually handmade from leather so you can expect to pay a minimum of 300 well worth it though with the right care theyll last a lifetime
is the style beginner friendly i want to try this out but my thrift stores are all very modern leaning and there really isnt such that fits it im also quite broke
  in english probably harem pants or slouch pants
  i would say so its friendly for reusing pieces there arent many strict rules and very thriftable can you use ebay i find a lot of stuff on there      unrelated someone must have this pic saved i lost it when my laptop died  girl in a field of maybe cow parsley red hair with tiny bangs and earmuffs it was one of my fav inspo pics
lets try to keep one going
thinking about selling my archangel jsk or trading it for the skirt i found some sales from a couple of years ago that were around 250usd
i would like to sell my marshmallow bunny jsk as a set with its headbow but i dont know how much it is worth
thinking of selling this let down of a dress no damages first owner may throw in a headbow that matches
  this is really cute why was it a let down
  all print moitie especially with shirring sells eventually so if youre comfortable to wait a while you could even charge a bit more but recently ive seen it at around 200 usd for western sales long version just sold for 19k on mercari and cc had one earlier this year sell for 26k after a few days if you want some japanese sales for reference as well     also the skirt goes for a lot cheaper although i think ive seen it at a little under 200 at times so youll be trading at a loss so just a heads up
  for the black colorway the western market seems to range between 100200    this one on lm which seems to be the most recent for the colorway sold for 180 with the headdress and otks included        dont know how quickly it will sell but id start at 150180 depending on the condition
    id like to know as well this is actually getting a re release
  this is not the one getting the rereleased thats melody toys an older print this one is called fancy whip they look similar from a distance because of the diagonal design elements im also curious as to why its a let down i own this in the exact cut and colorway and really love it it has that 2012 ott sweet vibe
      op here i wasnt a fan of the spaced out decor on the dress and the color doesnt match my skin tone well i tried pairing it with the classic blonde wig but it still doesnt suit my taste also idk its just not as great as other stuff i have desu but hey my loss can be your gains anons
picked this up on sale a few months ago thinking of selling it because the cut is unflattering on a larger bust still new with tags  what would be a realistic price to sell it for
  150180
i have this brand new with tags and matching stockings i havent seen any listings for it
  depending on the size 400  360 usd i would say youll get more if it is a size 2 because of the western market
how much would mms lieselotte jsk in wine sell for these days its missing at least two of the detachable bows they werent included by the previous owner i checked lm for closed listings and the only ones i see are from 2014
thinking of trading pic related but i have no idea what i could get for it its in brand new condition
  uggghhhhhhh why does god hate me
  if it is a size 1  i would be interested
    if you end up deciding against trading it id pay a good amount for it email me with your price or drop your email and ill make an offer
  are you looking to trade for moitie or boz
  im assuming youre the anon whos been looking for the floral colourway with the wine trim im so sorry anon i hope you find it soon ive got all my fingers and toes crossed for you
sorry for bumping such an old thread but does anyone know how much metas shory sleeved bouquet op with the bonnet
  dropped pic
i have the jsk tights and matching head bow from this series i tried searching lm but the only listing i found for heartful requiem was a pair of tights that sold for 50 what would a full set be worth
  i dont know what a good amount for it is though i think a new dress would make me happier than money so ill keep looking for a trade for now      yes ill probably post it in the moitie facebook group soon at that time can you pm me     sorry for late reply i dont check here often
  thank you best wishes sent your way as well may mana brung us all our dream dresses
price check for pink honeycake round jsk with kc and socks
  75 if youre lucky my friend and have both had it in multiple colorways with matching headwear its not worth much
  you have the bonnet you could try for up to 90100 i dont think it will sell at that price but oldschool seems to be more popular so maybe there will be more interest than there used to be
  nayrt but thats not old school its revival bouquet the inferior knock off of the much superior antique bouquet print meta should of just straight up rereleased the original bouquet print instead of this sad abomination
how much is the melody toys collar jsk in sax worth i know the mto happened but it was only the high waist jsk so the collared version should still be rare also what is the most to least popular colorways i dont know why this dress is so popular but i never see anyone wear it
  its popular in japan mostly i think i dont really see anybody talk about it in the west i think sax is the most popular colorway and black obviously the least i dont know about pink or mint but mint seems quite common
  i agree that mint is frustratingly common i barely ever see sax which is part of why im asking im hoping i didnt pay overly much for it    it would make sense if its more popular in japan because like no western girls wear it despite its full shirring
  250 to 350 pink is the least popular color     whats the going price on the mercator antique special set would 300 be too much the socks have minor damage
im looking to sell my rose museum jsk that i bought on impulse in japan i didnt really look at the price when i bought it and hadnt been keeping up with second hand listings for the couple of months prior as i was avoiding temptation at all costs while saving so i really dont know how much it is worth     excellent condition would appreciate some help     additionally does anyone know what price the mint x black colourway of the wrapping ribbon jsk should be fetching it is on my wtb and a few offers have been given but they seem much too high a price for a release that seems to be universally disliked to a degree
  desu 300 is stretching it    probably around 175200
  that colorway seems uncommon but personally i wouldnt pay more than 150 dollars or so for wrapping ribbon i never see it sell for very high and it goes for even cheaper on mercari
  anon i will totally buy that off of you kskbfjeba i dropped my email if you wanted to shoot me an email and discuss a price i love this set ___
  for rose museum or wrapping ribbon thanks for your response anon
  sent you a message
  my b idk about wrapping ribbon but the 175200 was for rose museum jsk since its excellent condition
  still looking for an answer for this i paid 265 did i get scalped
afternoon gulls thinking about selling a lot of my wardrobe since i rarely have time to wear it and im moving to china in a few months anyway i havent been through and catalogued it all yet but id like to get a price check on a few things i can name off the top of my head     ap chess chocolate jabot jsk in ivory minor stains with headbow and socks in brown     meta fancy egg sk in green the solid waistband not the elasticated one minor stains     atepie classical painting jsk in brown x cream     iw french poodle jsk in red     ap fruits parlour sk in black     btssb snow white sk in red    ive been out of the loop for a couple of years so i have no idea what anything is worth these days also im not desperate to sell and will hang on for the best price in the uk if that still makes a difference
  that seems like a fair price given it wasnt in damaged condition
  research on lm and then come back
    thanks i just got it today and the fabric is so crisp im pretty sure its never been worn so given that i think its a fair price i mainly dont know how the prices might fluctuate based on colorway
requesting price check for this how much would it cost having severe damage like bottom trim removed
whats a good price to ask for this dress the only listings ive ever found were both on lacemarket for 100120 and im not quiet sure if there was damage i know it retailed for 217usd brand new but other than that it would be nice to keep a price in my head
thinking about selling my axes femme x cocacola collaboration dress i wonder what is good price to ask for it
might sell my melty ribbon chocolate lowwaist bitter ive worn it a few times but its got nothing really wrong with it whats a good starting price
what is a realistic price for old school meta velveteen pieces that are in good condition  im moving towards gothic now and less old school so i need to find a good home for them
  depends on the pieces but generally 100200 depending on rarity and colorway i collect meta velveteen and have bought and sold a lot so feel free to shoot me a message with specific items and if its a piece i know well then i can show you what it goes for and maybe make some offers on items if theyre pieces i dont have yet
  weird response but if its this one can you email me its a dd of mine

lets start a thread for big armor builds the bigger the better heres my t60 power armor from fallout 4 standing at 7 8 ill post another photo with a 6 tall friend for a better sense of scale
the armor weighs in at 80 lbs with an internal pvc and metal frame to help distribute the load theres cooling inlets and outlets along with mechanically extended hands and pivoting stilts
the next iteration of this build will have an entirely aluminum frame along with hydraulics and servos to control some of the joints and the mechanical hands the goal is to have the next version open up identically to the ingame model
sick build op ive been looking for a good x01 model to do something like that heavy use of 3d printing or did you go classic pepakura
one day if i ever lost my weight and stopped beeing a buttergolem i want to built a space marine armor
wow so cool making a thread for yourself
  not really op was just using their work to start of the thread post more big cosplay please
    god fuck i wish i could do something this nice hoping in the future i can do a red comet mech cosplay
      oof i forgot this thread was for big armor and not just big cosplays in general my apologies
  holy shit does he share his process for that
  ugh fuck that hulkbuster cosplayer such a dickhead
  deets
  kind of cosplayer is pete mander i havent found much but         has some fairly in depth videos on the costume
  whose the rei cosplayer
    pete mander is an alcoholic and a thief when i was paying attention to him he sure wasnt giving out any info     but seriously fuck him he cant tell you anything that 15 minutes on google youtube and the rpf cant
  waah how dare there be a thread about cosplay on cgl    back to the containment feels thread fatty    post more info op curious to see your thought process and progress pics
  dont apologise these are still sick as hell
op are you single or like into that
  holy fucking shit op how long did this take
previous thread 
  wait didnt this chick already post this coord a few days ago at that why even post another picture of it on ild when you just did this outfit
  its nice to be able to start the thread with gothic most of the time when i start the thread its generally nothing special or straight up awful since i insist on being chronological    but ill be getting us through the ild and post ild stuff in this dump i hope thanks again for other anon in previous thread well be skipping anything already posted
  i want those of you who dump to know that i appreciate you and youre doing manas work you da real mvps
      i hate seeing the threads go to chaos and be disorganized lol thats mostly it i think one from 23 weeks ago was literally strange cherry picked out of order coords with so many missing bothered me to no end    plus cgl is like my comm as a lonelita unironically love this place
  i love starry_seiun whenever she posts of cof shes one of my new favorite lolitas
  hey its not a problem havent dumped this thread but i do quite often those lolitas who dont/cant use fuckerbook should still be included
  slouching and cheap cat ears  embarrassing behavior     i hate the editing here
  what is this filter
  would have been cute with a normal headdress and not some shitty crown
    what is with the influx of shitty nonlolita shoes
  i cant believe how many asspats this lady got for this coord its barely lolita but of course everyone just sees an african woman and therefore must shower her with compliments
  weird lipstick choice but okay
  is this the same girl from the craft thread with the amazing stained glass pieces i love this outfit
  last one done for now
  plus cgl is like my comm as a lonelita unironically love this place    real feel right here
  this is one of the rare times i like her posts but pls buy better shoes
  if this were on a white girl itd just be concidered average    very sweet    i dig everything about this    can we not do this shit    bonnet too big dress too tight poof so sad ill balanced cluster    always gorgeous    so refreshing i wish i had gotten this mto     old school dreams
    these are both magical
  her
  i dont like those dead animals on her shoulder not cool at all
  how old is this girl i am 37 and she looks 5 times older than i
  50 shades of pink
  i can feel the awkward creepiness emanating from this photo did anyone bump into her at the spanish embassy
  s/he always has the worst shoes like shitty toddler shoes i get that having big feet is a thing im an actual chick and wear an 11 but still i have pretty shoes that go with my coords lots of places offer custom sizes
  something about her sleeves looks off is one puffier than the other but other than that i really like this i like the attitude of it
  what the fuck is with showing your grey sportsbra way to cheapen the whole look of the outfit with a 2 dollar walmart top
  im sorry and good try but i just hate everything about this coord flowy kind of cult partykei ouji should not be a look this goes against every fibre of my being
  bust is way too small for her otherwise cute would wear more formal shoes though
  but it works really nice
  ill balanced cluster
  not really the shoes dont match anything the balance of pink is super off it looks like a noob who took everything they owned that was pink because they have nothing else and figured welp its pink
  calling the usa baby special events girl a noob ok linda sorry you dont have a creative bone in your body
  yeah she was shilling her shop in the description
  i dont care if it was mana it looks illplanned and shitty
    i cant believe how bad these idd blouses look on everyone including lolitas i normally like     also seconding the stop the sports bra look movement
    nyart but are you just a conlita or a roleplayer  because some people actually just like wearing lolita as clothes which means gasp throwing stuff on last minute that mightnt completely match its horrifying isnt it       she looks dope and the coord is cute
  can only conlitas match their pinks now
  the whole matching pinks thing is a joke anyways if its a different material it will never really match especially in all lighting
  no but they tend to think of a coord as one entity rather than a variety of items and pieces which are put together however one likes sometimes people just have to make do with what they have  are you really going to say she shouldve bought other shoes leather jacket beret and blouse just to wear this dress to run errands or she shouldve just matched it with whites and only one shade of pink     mismatched pinks is only really problem when youre dealing with solids or super polished coords you seem to misconceive the fact that lolita fashion isnt always about planning a coord for enough time to buy every item to perfectly match it
  this basically its called being fashionable
  the fact that this is getting 360 likes on cof just goes to show how many roleplayers and coslitas there are in the comm the ild spam pretty much proves that most lolitas in cof dont coord so well the silent lurkers just come out of the woodwork during ild
  it got likes because its a concept that has a clear aesthetic/theme and hasnt been seen a million times people not surprisingly want something new
  not necessarily true ive got several melissa shoes that match my dresses pretty well colorwise though its definitely easier to match similar materials      im not the anon who was complaining about mismatched pinks i dont care if her pinks are mismatched but i wouldnt do it myself but you seem to misconceive the fact that people who actually put an effort into matching colors arent just roleplayers or conlitas
    i like cosplay and this cosplay is better than all the other cosplays    is what i heard from you    also wings are probably the most tired concept in this history of ott
  new doesnt mean good
  they had a themed meet
  wearing wings yeah most people dont wear them on their head that being said its not really my thing but i like the grayscale she did
  is that her real hair gross i hate all of this
  well then i think thats very fair   i just dont think for this instance mismatched pinks is a valid criticism
  there is no excuse for not having a decent petticoat here get a cage if its very heavy its worth it     i always like her coords but theyre just starting to look the almost all same to me     needs accessories but its cute     beautiful    dont pose like this
  i hate to say it but plain flats wouldnt be a terrible choice for her tps and mary janes look creepy on her and shes too tall for heels maybe some flat booties with a nice shape and aesthetic but i have no idea where to get that
  perfect
  instead of knocking things down why not learn what makes them likeable   it doesnt mean bad either in this case people think its good and i can see why
  it does look pretty bad to me objectively but i do concede that people have different tastes  i prefer a simpler classier look so im definitely not the target audience for this ott mess
  dude just because they arent brand doesnt mean someone cant wear some damned shoes
    likes arent necessarily a hallmark of a good outfit im not sure how winning a popularity contest means people should ape it
  an actual chick  okay lets stop right there and rethink what you just fucking said
  wow could you maybe find something to a c t u a l l y compliment instead of just giving backhanded ones and just bitching its almost like youre not a very nice person
  fuck off vegan scum
  nayrt but you look like shit sorry the stupid crown ruins the whole coord i have quirky themed meets and coords too but i dont post them to closet of asspats if i know they arent up to par and i dont want an honest opinion
  lmao im actually not her and its sad that wanting an honest opinion would be wanting someone just bitching about it on 4chan because they obviously dont have anything better to do   and i believe the crown makes the coord its obvious that she put effort into this and maybe you could find a way to stop being petty  maybe its bc shes prettier than you
  if youre wearing it post it the only up to par you need to worry about is if youre doing it professionally in which case you wouldnt even be putting together the outfits to begin with the only people you would need to be afraid of is people like you
  aka asshats
  girl either had that altered or is incredibly short
  they dont have to be brand shoes but sneakers are not lolita in the slightest
  its a tranny its a dude who feels like a woman therefore anon saying shes an actual chick is perfectly valid
  not any of these anons but the crown doesnt add anything to the coord at all a nice headdress or even a pretty bonnet would look better and likely be a higher quality addition to the coord instead of a cheap looking crown
  i like everything here except for the fact that her toe is aggressively trying to free itself  the fact that i just hate squirrel party with the passion of a thousand itas otherwise cute
    looks like they went to the same meet how nice
  i like the mink but everything else is a no
  shes not awful but her coords are a bit lacklustre
  this looks adorable i love the green velvet
  this would have been very cute if she had the proper poof
  this was awful im not sure how it got 300 likes and all the asspat comments please scrap this coord
  yeah but then she wouldnt be on theme
  maybe its bc shes prettier than you  look im really not into the whole sorry you got posted bullshit but are you serious right now no one on 4chan is nice you sound like a damm child with the whole shes prettier  most girls who wear lolita are average as fuck girl in the pic is no exception just like other anons in the thread who are not in anyway exceptionally beautiful
we havent had one for a little while    dump incoming
  i dont hate this she needs a chest rig to fill out the theme
  shes wearing so much darker stuff now i thought maybe she was just doing rpa shoot to do some modeling but i think shes really moving towards darker stuff
  really curious to know what others think of this i personally love it but i never have the popular opinion around here
replica    yuck
  normie blouse  white blouse and cream socks  whatever that hat is    the bare bones of this is a fine simple hp coord idea and she messed it up somehow
  thats a man baby
end of dump
  lolita more like shitty kei no petti no headwear no silhouette what even is that
  i appreciate how consistent her coords are but id really like to see her try something different beyond putting a pin on the same beret she wears with everything  might be just me being a bit jelly she always looks cute regardless
  50 shades of pink
  fairykei if it was done at walmart
  the 50 shades of pink arent a huge problem you walnut its the replica and man factors that make this total shit
  alexander pechtold
  i like the bandage tights with this    this is a pretty cute way to wear this but i kind of want to see fishnets and more leather accessories with it i feel like her fear of criticism makes her nervous to try more esoteric things     super cute    lovely coord but she looks like she smells something bad     ew    fucking perfection
  and why arent they banned again
  you made me do a double take and now i cant unsee thanks anon
  i like it too but her description instantly made me roll my eyes somehow it sounded a bit like look i have this rare dress  inb4 ur jelly  i own all of the meta nurse series myself
  it looks obviously too small for her i know its supposed to be short but it looks like its not even made for her body type at all
  since when does garbagechan care about criticism
  and not one of them matches its a skill really
  i dont like it the bloomers should be black white makes them look a little weird and inappropriate
  it looks too small on her otherwise the coord is cute      just seemed like she was excited about owning hd not gloating
  they look kind of diaperish in that shot desu
  i dream of coming across a dress like this in closet child
  i didnt read it as gloating and im often a jelly saltpile when people get unicorn pieces
  its pretty hard to get a hold of second hand so i can see why she wanted to talk about it any time i buy a new dress second hand i just instantly feel like i finally found what i was looking for
  no its not anymore if youre willing to pay a bit above retail price and keep your eyes open on the second hand market the op set sold at least 5 times this year alone
  she has the most perfect legs those dainty ankles
  i never see it other than here in th bst but ok
  it looks too small on her  i dont see that at all what are you talking about
  she has an ed also so
  so do most lolitas they also tend to have nunya
  no she doesnt she just has narcolepsy
  if you look closely you can see that theyre shooped to look thinner the pixels around her legs are a bit blurry nothing drastic but still
  is that like bofa
  everything looks so small on her the skirt is too high the sleeves are short and the socks look awkward agree that black bloomers or an underskirt and higher socks or tights would improve this look a ton maybe boots literally nothing looks right and shes doing this dress such a disservice imo
  the dress looks baggy and i like how the white bloomers stand out i knew you fuck heads would hate it
  as if fb doesnt compress images
  nunya business
  bofa deez nuts homie
  wtf i just saw her post from a long time ago saying she graduated high school 11 years ago how old is this bitch she looks like 19
  she has thin legs shes always had thin legs and cgl wanks about it all the time
  yikes thats a bad attitude to take
  its more like ligma
  theres a really obvious blob of liquify on the inside of her left ankle anon look at the pavement
wanking over wafer legs when strong healthy legs should be the flavor of eternity    yall weak
  nah i know some of her relatives shes just tiny birdboned and chronically ill
  looks fine to me
  nothing is more embarrassing then when anons insist they are photoshop detection experts
  no one insisted anything but i think danielle wankers are worse
  ok but is that her real hair
  narcolepsy has a high obesity rate due to a lack of a certain hormone which helps burn fat iirc not saying she has to be obese just that her narcolepsy wouldnt make her magically skinny    so thats some bs
  go out sometime and look at real hair anon
  it wasnt meant to be insulting it just looks really soft and nice but i cant tell if its a wig since the headdress is covering her part line
    its very obviously a wig
  its possible to just be naturally skinny anon over eating is a learned behavior
skinny / affected by an eating disorder     im sick of people claiming the contrary educate yourself
considering just how long shes stayed at the same weight its safe to assume thats just her natural size

  was there anything in my post that disagrees with what youre saying im just saying narcolepsy is probably not the cause of her skinniness thats it
    i want to hate this but i dont
    this would be a nice coord if it actually fit
    ah yes wednesday adams so rori
  bro those uncut bangs it doesnt even look slightly real
  finished dump for now so we can stop wanking about skinny ankles and photoshop
  would it the parasol and sweater look a little shabby for how fancy the dress is    rip vm great styling
  couldve at least kicked the bottle caps and cigarette buts out of the way if she was going to take a pic in such a filthy place holy shit
  that shoop is straight uncanny valley girl dont do yourself liek dis you deserve better glad to see that shes improving her hair but a better blouse with puff sleeves would be cuter the socks clash terribly maybe plain white lace top ones would work better leave the pattern clashing to more experienced lolitas and get your basics right first
  was this girl the one with the kitten in the previous thread really like her creative poses and photo quality    this girl always looks cheap and tacky im always surprised about how much she mouths off in rufflchat when shes nothing amazing herself
  and miss out on that 90s crusty grunge aesthetic
  this is beautiful
  and miss out on that gross random ass trash in your photo aesthetic
    wow i sure wish she had taken a nice clean photo of her trash coord but those cigarette butts and bottlecaps totally ruin it for me
  different socks add bangs and this would be good shes getting better at coordinating but she looks much cuter with bangs i really like the milkmaid kei look with the braids though good choice on her part theyre cute hope shell go more adventurous with her hair in the future     shes really cute i like the uniqueness of her shots honestly     theres nothing wrong with this but its so underwhelming this jsk deserves better
  i like this most out of all the oldschool coords ive seen her do its not perfectly blanced and some elements clash but i think thats what makes this better as an oldschool coord it captures the feel of being a street fashion
  nope i will not kiss her ass on this one i usually like her coords so fucking much but this looks like shit and shouldnt be allowed if garbagechans cutsew/skirt coord wasnt she looks like a newbie ita ffs
  shes so pretty
  love this style of sleeve with this punkuma forever
  not feeling the cherry red accents with this wine op i would love to see this with a redxnavy regimental stripe main piece
  white lace otks would have been great here
  no she doesnt dont spread lies
  she lives in japan and the meds she should be taking are strictly controlled in that country so shes on a narcolepsy drug that makes it really hard for her to gain weight not an ed
  this is an amazing shot but i wish she didnt include the teddy bear it gives such a childish vibe to this classy coord i get that there are bears on the print but still
  did i say she has an ed please point where in the post i said that
  is this fridgechan from before she looks much better here glad to see youre improving girl you have a cute face and take concrit well and i think youll be a great lolita one day
  what dress is this
  i appreciate shes trying something different but this isnt that good nothing really matches in theme or color
  hold the salt chef  i was backing up your point i hope you dont talk to your friends like this      she doesnt have an ed   heres some more info about that to prove it   wow i said she doesnt have an ed    maybe you should go back to commenting on youtube full time you dont need reading comprehension for that
  god the skinny toothpick legs combined with tea party flats make her feet look so big lmao
  not liking the socks here at all and i wish shed just show her actual face instead of the creepy shoops but i like
  i like it as an oldschool casual
  its like the cross on her chest activated kek  its an ita detector
  fuck my life thats my dream dress and ill never look as cute in it as she does
  im happy shes back to lolita but i hate this tired of the beret and that makeup looks bad its not halloween any more get with the time
  i get really mad about shoop on here sometimes but as much as i wish i could say this girl shoops im not seeing it at all this isnt like wistywish shes really that tiny irl
  this she should be on modafinil or sodium oxybate but in japan the first is crazy controlled and the second is hard to get anywhere yet shes probably on dextroamphetamine which is an older treatment for the same problem and is basically legal speed you cant keep weight on with that its not her fault other than her choosing to be in japan i wouldnt do it if i had her condition but maybe living in glorious nippon is just that important to her
  just as i was saying thats the only disorder she has
  strained at the waist button and partially unbuttoned this doesnt work with that dress
  i dont think its strained just that it had to be unbuttoned since it wasnt full enough for that much petti agree that it doesnt suit that dress though but its a neat idea
  i know ill get called white knight for this but this is fine in my opinion not sure why people are getting mad besides vendetta very average but not bad its just casual
  i like this but this is one of my favourite meta dresses too its always nice to see how people coordinate it     i agree not sure what it is but i find it cute     love the winter vibes and that headdress
  i really like this it feels more natural and less calculated than some of her other coords the hair style is cute too
  yeah no shes this tiny irl and is a normal healthy girl
    this isnt lolita its a fucking cosplay
  woman shes like 30
  im into the idea of 2 different outfit variations but i wish she had a bit of poof going it looks like theres room for some
  one of mossbadgers really early prints she only made like 3
    reminds me of that paradiso ouji judge this should be outlawed
    both of these look like they just came back from a larp game
  further proving that shes not really good at coording besides copying old shots
  i want to hate this but i cant the industrial touches and the velveteen go so well together and i cant even make myself get mad about the length/cut when ap is putting out short uggo sack dresses anyways     t not someone who wants to see the fashion stuck in 2009 forever though
  dude wtf is that bruise on her right arm
  this is frumpy and not in a good way  her hat seems to be trying for the dusty victorian doll aesthetic but her dress screams budget barbie cake topper
  frumpy  budget  i strongly disagree
  that yellowed cream of the hat clashes with the jsk though and the length makes her look like she is swallowed by a whole lot of cheap tulle
  nothing fits and the post you replied to called her a budget cake topper i agree nothing matches or suits her and it looks sad especially the extra greasy hair with a retarded ott hat
  agree with the other anon this is cosplay and its ridiculous how much attention its getting fucking elf ears really
      it actually strongly reminds me of the american girls doll kirsten she was swedish american and had a book about saint lucia and christmas 
  further confirms that cof is full of normies who dont know a single thing about the fashion
  damn meant to reply to  
  is that not what its supposed to be
  loliable items never look lolita    10042899  boring and sloppy      dummy american anon kirsten is dressed in traditional st lucia dress so is   so thats why they look the same i dont think a euro lolita got her inspiration from american girl books
  i really love this the peeking bloomers work so well its almost like a kind of neoold school
  i like this but more for ott natural kei is that a thing very turn of the century
  all she needs to do is switch out the socks
    well yeah duh my fault for referencing the doll instead of just st lucia as that was the only reason i ever knew of it guess i deserved that
  looks like a shadow and not a bruise     i mean i guess but id like to see peeking bloomers     this is cute    holy fuck plumchan wash ur hair
    nah the dress is clearly too sweet and full of finicky tulle for that natural kei uses a lot of natural and flowy materials including cotton and chiffon this just has slightly too much form to it plus the hat which is beige looks positively yellow next to the dress which has off white tulle the braids either need to be fuller or she needs to ditch the stringy thin hairstyle its not ita but its definitely in between this and nitpick where she could do a lot by just doing the entire thing over
    you just like being a snarky pig
  sorry youre too busy kissing her plum ass to objectively judge the coord anon
  i never care about who is wearing the dress anon i just dont have shitty things to say like you do
  no one has the figure and coord skills to pull a short skirt  this is the exception
  this is a fail way too short to even work with bloomers peaking bloomers should be longer anyways these are short bloomers not meant to be seen
  i like this one but not too keen on the white tights
  i like this but in what world is this lolita
  you have a problem with white tights in a shiro coord
  wouldnt call it a problem just personally find them too plain peeking bloomers would be a nice addition as the other anon said or some decal/lace top socks while there are shiro coords with white tights i think it always looks better when people have either of those things
  that bodice looks so awkward on her
  im narcoleptic and the only thing were lacking in is hypocretin its a chemical that stimulates wakefulness i think it has something to do with appetite regulation    personally i find it hard to gain weight as i sleep through so many mealtimes
  maybe its the same anon but lately ive been noticing more posts referring to anything anklelength as natural kei including aps typical polyester chiffon stuff i guess someone here thinks that longer length  ruffles  natural kei regardless of materials or overall aesthetic it ruffles my jimmies a bit because i love natural kei and wish it would make a comeback but this aint it chief
    its really annoying i love natural kei too but if people are going to throw around that word theyd better not be trashing my beloved ingeborge pink house etc and thinking any frothy mess by ap and the like is somehow suitable for natural kei
  does anyone have any other photos of this parka its really cool
  lol i actually normally defend her as she has a few cute coords lately this isnt one of them its bad
  hey im not the one going around calling people a snarky pig that stick is stuck so deep in your self righteous ass that its coming out of your mouth kek
  she would be average if not for her grandma jowls self post
  nayrt  what a stupid thing to be critical of but im sure youre perfect so what do i know
  when youre so insecure you just cant let anyone else get a compliment
  kek  that is the snarkiest phrase you can use though youre clearly a fucking snark queen
  sorry youre so dramapoisoned you cant appreciate something genuinely good
  snark queen  i can live with that    drama poisoned by what exactly i dont care if its plum chan or not its shitty coord and im just saying exactly how i feel about it even if connie wears it id still think its bad    if you think that cake topper kei is genuinely good then i seriously question your taste in fashion
  sage but shes only in nippon because of her uwu japanese husband and her followers think living there is like being on vacation all the time she resorts to whining on fb constantly instead of getting help in a first world country
  is that the op or is it the topskirt set either way it looks too small
dump incoming        come on saraaaaaaah stop being jelly and lose some weight i hope my comment dont mysteriously disappear again despite not breaking any rule
  way way way too short and no petti not lolita just looks like a fancy gothy outfit
  why no makeup
  lovely
  i want to give this girl a makeover so badly rip out those weird eyebrows give her face framing layers and bangs put some make up on argh
  this gives me a song of ice and fire got vibes i like it
  that hand print on hello kitty
  i love the westeros ouji look its interesting     this is cute    nice engrish but who now     that wig is terrible holy fuck    this is super short maybe some black bloomers       2018 on cgl no makeup grossness vs instathot cake faceness  who will win
  where is that skirt from
  advent it was for their fashion show at the grand embassy im pretty sure
  things like the teddy bear makes people think that lolita is for ageplay
  can we please stop regurgitating this meme the fashion has included cute shit allegedly intended for children since its conception and normies have associated the fashion with trying to look like a child for some weird sex thing for as long as its been in the west you can look up old articles in egls archives if you dont believe me one ragged old teddy bear in one lolitas professionally taken shot is hardly whats going to suddenly convince normies that the fashion is ageplay  tldr stop nitpicking dumb shit like this and let lolitas enjoy cute shit in peace
  reminder that every time you use this two in the same sentence you bring them closer together    this
  one ragged old teddy bear in one lolitas  the problem is that it isnt just one just browse this thread  adding children toys as part of a coord is cringy and only further confirms to normalfags that the fashion is ageplay    reminder that every time you use this two in the same sentence you bring them closer together  less than actually going outside with children toys in lolita
  are u saying i cant like teddy bears because theyre cute
  anon normies think youre into some weird sex thing just for wearing a frilly dress and a bow in your hair when youre over the age of 8 a teddy bear usakumya or a toy print on your main piece isnt going to make their view of us better or worse so just let people like cute shit
  point taken   but i will still think that carrying toys is cringy and helps a lot more into the weird sex thing than anything else
  i really didnt realise they were all different until i placed them side by side     sorry for the crappy collage im on mobile
  so holding a teddy bear is childish  but wearing a literal teddy bear / bunny as a purse is ok  im looking at you btssb for real are you just turning your head at what a lot of lolita do all the time  and dont say its not the same thing because it is  anon
   but wearing a literal teddy bear / bunny as a purse is ok  imo no is cringy and tacky same for heartshaped purses and ribbons bigger than the hand of the person  are you just turning your head at what a lot of lolita do all the time  and dont say its not the same thing because it is  anon  i dont know what you mean by this
  and yes this last part is my nitpicking and i know it
  same for heartshaped purses and ribbons bigger than the hand of the person  so bears and usakumyas are tacky and heart purses and large bows are cringy do you like lolita at all   inb4 nnot all lolita coords include these things1  cute things are a part of the fashion heart purses and giant bows have been staples of lolita fashion for two decades if not longer if you dont like these things then i cant help but wonder what the fuck youre doing here
  see 
  right looks fine i dont mind this light make up for classic
  those shoes are not cutting it    disagreed not too short for goth would look better with paltform heels for that mana aesthetic
  top left hat is raising my blood pressure i need it  she looks so pretty in top middle
  youre not going to win us over with this unpopular opinion anon   my stuffed toys are my children and i love them dont like women genuinely enjoying things they like thats just toooooooo bad
    this so much if you dont like it its fine if you dont like it and keep being obnoxious about it what a pain in the ass girl
  yea i agree i ordered the beret custom and specified that i wanted a wine bow but the bow is more of a deep red and i didnt really have anything else for headwear that i liked and the otks i also thought were wine but they have that same deep red tone its weird bc i have a lot of things that are officially listed as bordeaux/wine that end of being the wrong hue its like no one can agree what that color actually is lol
  i absolutely know the struggle of matching wines its a cute coord for sure its the stripe effect as well that makes the wine of the op appear even darker than it might be in person   maybe some accessories can tie the shades together like a gold necklace that includes both deep red and winei think a bookshelf necklace and/or an academicstyle crest brooch would look cute with this university aesthetic jm has some amazing stuff for this style
  ngl i sleep with 3 stuffed animals its not even a childish i cant fall asleep thing but they are nice to hold onto and i collect them
  she looks so cute in all of them honestly all these salty anons are just jelly that they will never be this thin and cute
  theres something so wrong about this outfit her face and hair and lips all look the same colour and it bothers me because there is no contrast compared to the dress
  it would look better with light colored tights or socks
  she has bulimia and those ugly glasses havent been cute since 2012  you just think she looks cute because shes asian
  youre fucking retarded if you think lolita and big ribbons/heart purses dont go hand in hand more than a dog and a dog house    are you even a lolita lmao
    im insecure as fuck but im definitely cuter i also have more followers despite being less obviously fame hungry i also coordinate much better
  did she list what wig this is alsodoes she have ig i dont have facebooksorry this is a lovely coord
    mintkismet on instagram
  absolutely gorgeous      i need more cute girls in meta      sweet in every way of the term made me smile      so cute and so doll like
  insecure as fuck  that explains your need to post a cringey response like that    its not a competition many lolitas are cute
  jsk could use a good steaming but the coord is cute
  this  id trade my body for hers but not my face lord
    all these salty anons are just jelly that they will never be this thin and cute    your lack of reading comprehension is cringe
  same here i have a large stuffed dolphin ive had since i was a kid that i cuddle with sometimes
holy shit i am so tired of people arguing about plumchan she coords well sometimes shes decently cute but shes nothing special shes not hideous or terrible either i dont understand why every cof thread shes posted in devolves into shes cute ur jelly vs shes an ugly ita
  mee tooo i have a giant usakumya pillow and a bunch of other animals in my bed i am almost 30
  if you associate childrens toys with sex youre the problem
  not sure this is lolita but can i just say her eyewing ggame is strong
  jfc if youre going to jump on the oldschool train thats thundering through the fashion now for no apparent reason then at least jump on prepared wtf are those shoes
  a bit of poof bangs platform heels and otks would make this way better
  no i read that  it still stands that the sureness with which you are baited in addition to your need to anonymously assert your attractiveness is criinge  you wouldnt respond if you were secure
    wow such astute observation next youll be telling me some people use cgl for anonymous shitposting
    they always look so good and are very nice people
  omg are you freud himself such clever reading of subconscious
  
  i agree with the other anon this is very cringey if all you can respond to something is haha im actually cute just dont bother
  oh my god this is terrible advice
    sorry youre not cute
  nayrt but you literally sound 12 right now
  moshi moshi baito desu
  i dont mind bear prints but usakumyas are a little weird imo they do look too childish
  its because she either self posts or has annoying whiteknights like   who snap everytime someone even says something less than positive about her   iirc a stupid wk was the reason for her plum chan nickname
  no not them but i am imagining red legwear and a small red hair accessory and it looks more interesting
  this is so boring and i dont really like any of them top middle and right are kind of okay i guess but i wish she would try different colors boleros etc
  she started shooping her face since people called her plum chan bottom middle row is probably more accurate shes plain as fuck i dont get all this wank about her being cute or ugly
  i wondered how long this would take when i posted that
  she already has nice legs but the black makes them look better theres no red in the print so i dont think it would tie in well it looks very kuro besides the flowers the whole point is to be entirely black
  i feel bad she gets so much hate since its not really her fault at all sure she posts a lot which is annoying but not worth the wank its not her fault she has whiteknights
  thats why i said with a red hair accessory
  uh why the flowers are light colored it wouldnt look bad if you brought them out with lighter colored legwear if it were a completely solid dress though id agree but its not
  ntayrt but youre just like any anon who comes here to nitpick the fashion makes you sound like you dont wear it
   wig is brightlele
  im not just whiteknighting her then i reply that way to anyone who is just here to shit talk especially if the shit talking ia the same ol same ol comments  we get itttt her face is whacky we fucking know
  yeah i get what you meant her wks are annoying even when its legit crit it gets drowned out by youre just jellyyy and the whole thread just derails    probably because she posts a lot of the same outfits and i do have a feeling that she wks herself on here sometimes since its all the same yer jellly comments
    i give legit crit every time and it gets ignored in lieu of people wanking about her face
  not the boss of me   policing content here
  its plain to see that you really are jelly though
  nayrt i was wondering too when i read it
holy shit can we please stop shitting up this thread with the same boring arguments about like 3 people nobody cares about your pathetic vendettas except yourselves and thats the real cringe that you would expend so much energy on this      maybe the reason oldschool is having a revival is partly the 20 year cycle of fashion things fade in and out of trend in relation to each other after ott things became more simple and reverted to the roots of the fashion also the young women who are leading the revival were all probably in their early teens or preteens during the late 2000s when lolita became more well known through livejournal and even tumblr so that was their first impression and are now old enough to afford lolita themselves and wanna make their dreams a reality
  its not a print it is embroidery its literally named rose ribbon embroidery       the silk flowers are pink not red red hair accessory would make no sense
  honestly at this point i hope the thread fills up with the shit so i can make a new thread i promise if it fills up tonight ill make a new one pronto its just not worth it to do a dump when a thread is this close to death and full of cancer    though i appreciate your sentiment anon
  you can have more than two colors in a coord you know
  assuming that the replies are all coming from the same anon  are you new or what i dont give a shit about this girl im just annoyed by all the wks shitting up the threads if she could just accept some concrit and move on instead of being all defensive then we wouldnt even be having this conversation  tldr im sick of seeing plum chan and all her wks shit up thread after thread
  i have a feeling  your feelings arent fact
  never said you couldnt i usually like accent colors no matter how much cgl shrieks about shoehorning but in this case those roses are a very delicate pink with green vines linking them red would look very harsh and clash with them it would look like oh i had nothing to coord with this pink so i used red instead lol white or cream blouse and socks could be nice though id even say gold accents could be pretty too but really not red
  sorry i meant to say embroidery
  assuming that the replies are all coming from the same anon  not sure how you got that from my post i am specifically calling you jelly
  thats why its called a feeling ya autist
  why would i be jelly of a girl who gets shit on by cgl all the time and has idiot wks like you though   she doesnt even own that much brand
  you tell me youre the one whos jelly
  u jelly  oh plum chan asskisser if only everything can be solved by calling other people jelly  i feel like im replying to a braindead troll that can only repeat the same tired argument over and over    sorry for the spam anon ill also dump in the next thread you make as penance  not all of the replies are mine but you have my promise to try to ignore the shitty plum wks at this point im convinced that theyre just trolling
  the shoes ruin it and with a skirt that short she needs some otks to cover more of her leg and balance it out a bit
  i feel like im replying to a braindead troll that can only repeat the same tired argument over and over  it took you long enough
  im just glad my life isnt as pathetic as yours
  she could probably do with longer sleeves on her blouse too or at least choosing a pose in which the wrist cuffs are more visible
nice to see everyones still retarded keep up the good work
  y you too anonkun
  this thread was killed by the combined wankiness of plem chan mintkissmyass and purse chan    may lord have mercy on their souls
  i want to hear what you think is legit crit  come on tell us your amazing insights
  wait who is purse chan
  that wanker who went on and on about how animal purses in lolita was totes ageplay      autism the thread
  to be fair her face is kind of busted and warrants critique
  love you anon     youre right which is why i feel like my meme was well chosen
  stupid  wowthanks jerk i did not wk her all i did was genuinely compliment a coord posted of hers a while back and say that her face shape was cute imo like a plum   and then all these insecure hos start fucking screeching like calm down
  other anon is right the pink flowers add such a small amount of color that light legwear would completely throw the coord offbalance a pink flower hair brooch is the right amount and placement of color to balance but the way she has coorded it with all black is perfectly fine
  mintkissmyass  i laffed
  like a plum  yeah i remember you and your retarded compliments never do that shit again nobody needs a stupid nickname stuck to them id feel bad for plum chan but nobody really likes her anyway
    if you werent so retarded you could have read the thread instead of making a braindead statement
  if you werent so retarded  wow yeah youre just a little goldmine of knowledge with remarks like these    in case youre too stupid to see that this is sarcasm ill just fill you in its sarcasm
plush edition    previous thread     itabag faq and beginners guide  do not post your question if you havent read this first      old thread archives      buyf/a/g guide  buyfagmoe    discord link      bootlegs are never ok to buy and use dont be a poorfag
before i buy it overpriced from wunderwelt is there anywhere else selling the berryq gold heart bag
my guys birthday was on the 11th and im both in awe and incredibly envious of this shrine
  probably taobao
    the little pink monster plushies in these are going for 28000  32000 in the secondhand markets
  i looked and its out of stock listed as 9999yuan
lets get some discussion going    christmas is coming up do you have any plans to celebrate with your husbando or waifu any christmas themed shrines or itatrees maybe a christmas itabag in the works    if not that will you treat yourself to an early christmas present with more merch
  i might just do what i did a few years ago and put my kakyoin sas at the top of our christmas tree pic related sorry for the horrid quality i might do a christmas shrine or an itatree but idk if id actually want to take my bag apart for the latter
  its kinda a running gag to draw my husbandos hair with ornaments in it for the holidays since hes a tall green tree man so i think im gonna make a festive commission or do a novelty layout    im probably going to treat myself to a kumamate too or ideally commission a plush doll im also making my own omanju which would look great on a tree
hi folks making my first ita bag wondering if you have any sites to recommend that are similar to etsy tictail etc where i can find fanmade merchandise and independent creators would also love to find more japanese equivalents of these sites such as booth thanks
  christmas has been a rather subdued holiday around my place the past couple of years so i never really go too crazy with decorations anymore but i do go out to the tree in the middle of town late at night when its lit to do a shrine for my husbando if my travel plans work out then ill be doing something extra special this year i love the holidays though so im excited either way
  i thought this was haise sasaki for a while and tried to figure out why theres so much idol boyish merch of him
  itatrees  everytime i think of that i just think of that guy on /a/ who did the waifu figure tree last year anyway im just gonna get pillows of my otp nothing too exciting
i just got a tote bag that has my bias printed on each side its official merch and really nice so i dont want to put pin holes in it so im thinking about putting a clear bag over it  attaching the merch to that and putting another clear bag over that to protect the merch is this dumb am i just over thinking
  you could also get a paper sleeve protector/ file divider and pin your merch to that so you dont need all those clear bags tho im not sure it would work for charms mostly buttons  you could also get some tulle fabric and pin stuff to that as well and sew your merch to the tulle
  for japanese fanmerch booth really is the best that we filthy gaijin have  otherwise dig around storenvy i highly recommend trying to find an artists twitter or tumblr because usually theres a shop link its hard to just surf general sites for shops now
    this is a cool idea i recommend a fabric called cotton gauze instead of tulle ive used it before when i needed a fabric that looked like organza but would be easier to dye its incredibly sheer and not shiny you can buy it on dharma trading
  try looking around doujinshicarrying sites that artists sell from as well toranoana melonbooks cqweb/kbooks and alicebooks all come to mind i know tora and melonbooks carry fan merchandise for sure search as normal or look for グッズ or アイテム categories
deltarune bags when
  they already got pins in the official shop so likely soon  i wont make a ralsei bag but im dying to see one
  who ever made these bags should be extremely proud the ghost plush is especially cute
people who wear this at my uni get beaten up or have no friends or listen to kpop
  btw my uni is in japan
  tfw no itabag group to go to cons with    seriously tho these matsu girls are goals
why the fuck did you make a new thread you know its gonna go to shit when one of the first comments is trollbait like this  the good anons are gone its time to let it die
  oh my god are you actually for real is this a troll is there really someone this fucking dumb who cant even read the faq    anons are right its time to let this thread die and stop making it if this is the kind of anons keeping it going fucking sage this shit
  i wouldnt mind doing a lancer bag im probably gonna have to wait a couple weeks for all the fanmerch to be up online though    i agree bags with a nice big plush are always adorable
  comments like this aint making it any better youre basically just stirring shit
    this thread is finally dying
    bye then
  no plans to celebrate with my husbando until next year since im planning to do a big shrine when his figma finally releases in hopefully february    i decided to spoil myself a little bit this month with stuff because by the time christmas rolls around all my items should be in and then itll be time to ship them i bought lots of merch and a base bag its been awhile since ive done anything bag wise so im excited
  one of my girls birthday is on christmas day so it works either way      this was an anon here once upon a time when this place was decent
  the guide doesnt even cover doujin goods stop overreacting to stir shit
  this was an anon here once upon a time when this place was decent  if they ever come back tell them that their bag is adorable
  a lot of them are still here just lurk less because quality went down by a lot when facebook latched on to it as the next big trend
  waiting for my favorite artists to open up keychain commissions to have the otp bag of my dreams i have the power to make oc/canon ships possible with the power of money im also going to make a bag for an old favorite that finally got an anime so hes got lots of merch to choose from now        the heart is my favorite
1/2
2/2
  the left and middle bags
  all the bags look bad to various degrees the far right bag has fairy lights everywhere
  considering the comments and the bags posted already yeah this shit is dead its pathetic that you guys are dragging this corpse
  i cant believe itabagging is completely dead    pack it up ladies time to find a new hobby
any anons know if its possible to make your own acrylic stands i just want to make one of my waifu but it seems like you have to order in bulk to have them produced by chinese companies    i also really wanted to make something like pic related for a shrine type deal
    if youre using alibaba just refine search for min order 1          samefag at least try a little
  fucked up oh well dropped an image anyway
  sure jan
  i was  and i was joking i thought it was a little obvious
  its ok guys i was only pretending to be retarded
  it was its fine
  not samefag though middle one is me but not the other two  nice try though i guess it just hurts your autism
hi guiiiiz just finished my new otp ita bag its mostly fan art from ebay because i cant find any official merch that i liked at all i checked your links in the faq but i prefer the fan stuff i dont like the art of bnha at all i followed your diy and made a few badges from fan art myself im not selling them so the creators wont care     i had some ig comments complain about my choice of bag but its so nice it suits them perfectly i dont have a load of money to spend i wanted to make it as cheap as possible because the love is more important thats the point of this hobby anyway
are we being raided
raines recently sniped one of my dd from me and is now selling it at a stupid price what a bitch oh well i will never buy from her so ill keep up the hunt
  wrong thread
  the worst part is that this is one of the better fanbags that ive seen out there
  one day im going to make neon and bold colors the thing
  ahh yes because getting your fan merch from ebay is good    boy i hate this thread
  well good to know komun made some good money off of this at least
  are you really that dense
i think my boyfriend is giving me this bag that i was really interested in for quite sometime im quite excited
  did you literally just ignore my entire post
  damn thats cute link
  youre baiting
  here you go anon 
  thanks this might be fun for like a pouch for a disney bag or something i just really like the top part mainly
  i really like the bright colors and the fact that its a splash of color instead of the whole thing the top part is also cool
  zap creatives does stands if you dont want to go the china route
  i think most people ignored your post youre just another trash anon
  i know this is baiting but all the merch is from individual artists with online shops so it isnt buying/making bootleg art ripped from the internet   other than the fact its completely fanart of a big franchise with lots of official merch and thus against the spirit of itabagging i actually dont see anything horribly wrong with this bag the symmetry and hiding pins took effort
  the symmetry and hiding pins took effort  yeah i can agree with that   the base bag glitter window and insert fabric are shitty but the merch and arrangement is fine      speaking of this thread being quiet the fb group has also seemed to calmed down and even really good bags arent really getting passed 100 likes   maybe the band wagoners really have shifted out or maybe after christmas things will pick up again
  yeah i honestly really like the color scheme in that bag       i think the bandwagoners have shifted out most of the big itabagging series have died down  anyone see any new trends on the horizon i dont keep up with airing anime
  when do you think are the prime itabagging months now with holiday season summer/con season that could be a factor
  thank god maybe only the quality bags will stay now
  new anime seasons usually late winter early spring new releases come out and new seasons start bnha will be back next year so expect that shit to bring bandwaggoners back    on the plus with hero academia the popularity of fatgum hawkes and suneater will probably create a demand for orange yellow and non lavender purple base bags
  create a demand for orange yellow and non lavender purple base bags    i cant fucking wait aaa
  personally i think con season is the most popular since at least for me its more motivating when theres a big event you can present your bag at not to mention a lot of novice baggers go for fanmerch/whatever they can find at a con    i dont think hawks will be animated quite yet but i absolutely cant wait for the influx of new character merch even though i know im still gonna be salty about how much merch is exclusively deku/baku/todo if both mirio and gentle appear this coming season i will actually die
  there wont be nearly enough fatgum merch and im saving now to be scalped to hell as i fight other fans for his stuff   nitotan fatgum plushes and straps  hurt me wallet more    hawks is definitely going to be a big seller though when he does show up but once he shows up that means more endeavor stuff and more likely i can find a nice navy base bag
is this a fairly new bag
  liking endeavor    t r a s h
  you gonna post a sauce for us or not
  its the same type as     and as far as i know not really new
  oh shit my bad then      oh here 
  ive been wanting to get one for my son but black is always sold out when i check and i havent managed to find a secondhand one at a respectable price i should check again though its been several months
  good luck anon
  is this a chinese brand being resold on wunderwelt because i got a waifu who loves cats and this is perfect but that price tag
  im sorry anon but i have no idea i just found it in the japanese twitter tag
  theres also a furry like one thats coming soon i suppose 
anyone know a decent way to secure a one coin style figure in a bag like this not the actual bag but similar idea the bottom of the window panel has a floor about 1in deep so the figures stand fits but it wont stay put my lady has very few official merch items so id really like to include it in mine would also prefer not permanently modifying the figure in the process too
  i dont know if it helps but heres this
  can you sew some fishing line through your backing and around part of the figure to hold it in place youll probably have to do it in a few places but it should hold it and the fishing line wont be super visible
  implying  im here for navy base bags endeavor and hawks are meh tier
  im pretty damn sure ive seen it on taobao before but i dont have a link
im so excited i finally got my new base bag in for another bag for my waifu     mfw my favorite part is testing around layouts     how you guys go for how you put your merch in your bag
  a five second google search found it you dumb fuck it was 40 and the preorder is over
  thats a weird way of helping someone anon
  anyone have a lead on that dark purple base bag at the bottom    all the purple base bags i can find are pastel and its killing me
 no more gets a ton of new merch this year   but its also less gay than previous merch   its also event exclusive    fine then
  its amazing how difficult googling michiko cat taobao is    has anyone ever made a bag from a series still airing did you regret it later recently fell in love with something this season and the merchandise is coming in fresh but since we dunno how its gonna end im not sure if i wanna throw preorders down last time i loved a series the ending was so bad
  youre not looking very hard anon both zakka and wego do dark purple bags / are we really gonna have to spoon feed you jfc            rakuten has tons of cheaper ones too          seriously how fucking hard it is to search 痛バッグ and look at the color options god damn we got thick as hell anons this thread is dead
  i started collecting merchandise aimlessly while the anime was airing but didnt know i wanted to make a bag until after it ended it was an adaption so i couldnt care less that they fucked up the ending my only regret is how cancerous the fandom is despite it being so small      complains about people asking to be spoonfed  spoonfeeds  though its not like we were going to have relevant discussion without these anons anyway
    nayrt but i didnt know they had added a dark purple colorway for this bag thanks so much for your post i really hate how neon the wego purples can look
  me too anon i find doing layouts quite relaxing what i find helps with working out how to lay everything out is matching merch that mirrors each other i also put bulkier merch close to the bottom like can badges as it tends to ground layouts more    thankyou to the anons who answered my christmas questions and for keeping the thread cosy here are some more  what do you prefer buying multiple base bags or making multiple inserts for one bag  do you have a grail item maybe youve found it already did your wallet suffer or was it for a steal price  what is the weirdest item you have in your itabag or collection as a whole
  was looking for the heart window in dark purple like the one in the picture but i might have to settle for a tote    thanks for the salt anyway
  wego  a google search but ok sure
which proxy should i use for mecari i read in the archive a bunch of them wont shop there and i tried placing an order with japonica and i just received a mail saying they wont accept more new orders because they are full
  graffart does the best merch currently imo
for you lolita itabaggers btssb revealed these base bags on their twitter no release date or prices yet afaik just a heads up for anyone who might be interested in these
graffart releases new christmas set  delete the tweet shortly after  why do they do this
  fucking hell anon they even linked wego take your retard back to facebook
both would be great for characters i bag but why do they have to overcharge so badly
  oof where are these from im in love with the coffin bag
  wow this is precious i love how big itabags are this will be an actually useful bag
  dual wield studio
  i need that bear so bad holy shit
  anon thats basically the basic bitch bag of the hobby and other anon even linked it    being this much of a cunty newfag  we hate your kind here please leave
  oof those prices thats more than if you imported a wego or zakkamart bag complete with ems shipping are they handmade or something
  the inserts arent terrible but theyre way too loud for any kind of decent itabagging    but yeah im pretty sure the price is because they seem to be marketing it around the inserts its just a boring circle window otherwise    which makes me wonder why circle windows arent more commonly used
    you and i know those prices are because they are marketed to shitty pin collectors that so badly want to call their bags itabags
  are those nendoroids
mfw amiami has opened pre orders again for some items i really want    so much for saving money get fucked future me
  nendo petits much smaller and usually only very basic joints
  i use vvjapan theyre pretty quick with responding and purchasing items   ive also heard that people use white rabbit express but ive personally never tried them
  white rabbit shouldnt be used unless its a high cost order their fees are a percentage and its not beneficial otherwise
i was a fool to think id ever be free of this hobby god dammit graffart
  good mix of old and new series  good mix of popular and unpopular series  frequent releases   adorable artstyle   none of us are safe from the holy graffart anon we might as well just except it as our new lord and savior and post what series wed like to see them do i personally would love to see them do an rpg horror/spooky game especially ib corpse party or yume nikki since those ones are my favorites
        i guess im a weirdo then but i dislike graffart merch then again one of the things i love about my husbandos series is the art style so   if the background colours for the graffart merch werent so messy/random id be more interested
  thats fair i really like the girly coloring book aesthetic its got going on though
  youre not alone im not a fan of graffart merch either but its more because it didnt suit my husbandos style in general most of the other series looked okay though
  honestly im not too thrilled about the background choice they used for the gu characters because its not going to fit in easily with my bag but i cant be picky with merch since its been so scarce until recently
  man im loving their shugo chara stuff i agree that it doesnt fit every single series but gosh when it does it does id love to see them tackle more magical girls/little girl shows like precure or pripara
  never gonna understand this pinbags are fucking gorgeous when theyre done well and they cost a bomb why are they so eager to lump them in with our trash bags
i got a bunch of majima  kiryu merch and also the base that pretty much everyone uses for him
  shugo chara  hold the fuck up anon
made one originalsakura bag setting layout clearcardsakura bag before i remove keychain bits    what color fabric should be used for the bg
  pink or a pastel yellow
  amazon
  thats a bootleg you fucking walnut
so im making a saber ita bag anyone have good tote bag recommendations and should i go with black white or blue i might throw a couple gligamesh things in aswell so colors will be gold red and blue
  pastel yellow
finished my bag but im looking for some crit on it to improve anyone got some suggestions     also i know i take really bad pictures sorry about that
      i cant wait for the next season im not sure if ill do a fatgum bag but just having merch for him is exciting      im thinking ill probably do a hawks bag i have been looking for a decent base but might have to just make one myself im saving up now for when merch for him eventually drops likely wont be until season 5 though so it will be awhile
  take out the birthday charm and graffart card case and replace them with items that match
baby itabagger here i hope its alright to ask a question here since stupid questions is really for jfash     im going to start collecting items for my first ever itabag this winter didnt realize that my lifelong husband had slowly over the years built up enough merch that an itabag is actually possible im actually so excited for this at first i was going to just buy every individual thing i can find as it pops up in auctions but looking through the thread i notice that the best bags just look good and organized between the pieces not necessarily cramming every item ever into the bag is there a level of prestiege to actually having each item you could get especially for less popular characters or should i be prioritizing aesthetics of the pieces or is worrying about that silly when i should just focus on getting the items for now then figuring out how to make it all mesh    at least eveyrthing will all be straps/badges/coasters since my husband doesnt have a plush rip the styles on the items are very inconsistent between releases and promotions though
  i think its better to prioritize on an organized bag you can still get everything you can find but all of it doesnt necessarily need to go into your bag i have my leftovers displayed on a cork board
  everyone does it differently especially for characters with less merch but in the end  is right youre going to feel better with a prettier bag try to buy merch that you personally like and there will more than likely be some style cohesion there and you can always adjust the layout of the bag to make things more cohesive along the way       yeah unfortunately that card case really breaks up the symmetry of the bag which is sad because it really goes well with the aesthetic youre working with maybe theres a way to incorporate it somewhere else on the bag
  thanks for the advice i definitely agree now the only problem now is finding merch thatll fit that spot haha anyone know how big these ones are     maybe theres a way to incorporate it somewhere else on the bag  im gonna put it on the outside of the bag on the zipper part
wheres the fanny itabag base at again
  its berryq on taobao  
anyone have suggestions for a tan or gold base bag backpack style preferred     i know theres the berry q gold star shaped one but that wont really fit my theme
  thank you so much
  what kind of theme are you doing any specific designs or shapes you wouldnt want besides the star
    thanks so much for the advice i really appreciate it with some of the merch being rarer/pricier ill probably buy whatever suits my fancy avoid whats ugly and see what looks cohesive and not cram it all in     i feel bad for asking another baby level question buthow do you guys generally find out about new releases my husbands series had an anniversary and a new flood of old character merch the past year thats still going a bit i check places like amiami daily to see if theres new stuff coming out but they miss things of course is it like find an fb group that caters to your fandom/posts releases in general a website that announces stuff another merch selling website like amiami sorry for newfagging this up im normally on cgl for the lolita but am excited for this new hobby
  youre fine anon your questions arent dumb do you have a twitter if your fandom has an offical twitter account ive found most new merch gets posted on those outlets
  berry q has a preorder up for pretty standard shaped gold bags aka squares       now i miss the good saihara bag that used to get posted last update we had on that was she took it apart to move bags and then i guess she vanished fuuuuck i hate this ship too its such trash
  fuuuuck i hate this ship too its such trash  your opinion anon personally its my otp and i just came for crit on the bag not the ship
do you like or care about how the term windowbags is emerging as another name for itabags
  it shouldnt because an itabag doesnt have to have a window to be an itabag
go to japan to achieve dream vacation  find all the neat stores that just sell husbandu goods  wow   ok going for first husband love law from one piece   buy so many things  learn while buying he actually has some of the most expensive merch    dammit and here i thought loving the nonmain cast would be easier on my wallet why the fuck does his halloween button cost 25 when everyone else is only 6 dammit    also major props who live outside of japan and do big ita bags here all your gear costs just dollars in the us the same thing is x 158 times the amount how will i ever be able to shop again when i get back home
  lets see     bootleg bag kek   messy backing that doesnt suit the game floral seriously   actually neither bag or insert do you any favors or even match the characters   fanmerch in a series shitting merchandise seriously mfc that shit ouma is a cash cow    not to mention the quality of that fan stuff is deviantart tier theres some seriously nice stuff for ndrv3 but youve got bottom of the barrel   cheapest official merch available bar the two akiba cross   empty spaces between the merch that make the bag look barren   other anons already pointed out the problems with the symmetry   asking how big a piece of merch is when every retailer for it has the dimensions on i mean come on this isnt even research this is spoonfeeding   shit taste in ships    did you come from instagram because it looks just like half the shit that gets posted there    happy now newfag
  i think you could also put it in the center and adjust the buttons and charms around
  the passcase thats possible i was also thinking of just getting another one of the same passcase to go on the other side of the bag to get the symmetry to fit better     thanks for the advice but  shitting merchandise   what are you talking about dude its pretty barren on merch and a lot of it is reused sprites/official art which im not a fan of since for one it doesnt fit my aesthetic and for 2 i think it looks ugly on a bag unless its all reused sprites/official art once again though no need to lose your shit over the ship of the bag since i want crit on the actual bag
  if the conbaggers and like are going to start using it instead of bitching about how they are itabags im all for it same for instagram base makers otherwise i agree with       i had the same thought as  about centering the pass case and crappily drew out how id do it you could slide the one heart badge up or down depending on preference   for other things i kinda agree that the fabric seems unfitting and your insert itself doesnt completely fit i also think swapping the turquoise graffart badges into the corners might look nice since that way all 4 corners are mirrored properly
  thanks for the ideas anons i definitely like your guys ideas of having the passcase in the middle would sewing it in and pinning it in work well because it kind of flops around a bit as for the insert i agree the main reason that i used that one is because i thought it was purely purple and white stripes i think a checkerboard insert or a single color might also work well
  your cocktail charms feel a bit lost on the current insert and im not sure if a busy pattern like a checkerboard would help matters
  thats true what singular color would you recommend then
  personally i like the pinstripes so maybe white and gray would work alternatively you could throw caution to the wind and add an opaque backing to those charms i assume theyre fanmerch so it wouldnt be too sacrilegious
  and add an opaque backing to those charms i assume theyre fanmerch so it wouldnt be too sacrilegious  yeah thats possible and since theyre fanmerch i dont really care about what happens to them much white and grey does sound pretty nice though or i could just go pure grey
girl posts on the fb group telling people to show their ita coords  multiple people post all of them are underwhelming except a bakura bagger    i dont know what i expected  also is ita coord what were calling it fandom fashion sounds better imo
  law is one of the more popular op characters especially among females itabags are a female buyer driven economy high demand  low stock  high prices
  take your ship salt somewhere else
    i cant really tell if by ita clothes/ fandom fashion its supposed to be like an outfit covered in official pin badges like a wearable itabag but clothes or its supposed to be actual characterbounding fandom fashion ends up with a lot of somethingbounding stuff in them    supergroupies characterbounding for conrtibution theyre using the アニメファッション tag if that helps anyone
  personally i prefer when its something like your pic and theyre clothes with details inspired by the characters sukajans are always a nice choice
  super groupies stuff is always so nice
  remove the buttons of yuri love
  oh     does anyone have law bags to share ive never seen actually seen one and when you google it because he has so much official merch only his backpacks and sling bags come up
  damn thats some devotion right there
so i bought a load of connor dbh merch and i dont want to make the bag anymore i wanna sell all my merch off but the facebook group doesnt allow advertising should i just use ebay and hope for the best    also whats a reasonable price a few of these things i bought at cons and a few ae preorder only so i was thinking 50 overall the haul is worth about 80 theres some aliexpress merch in there but equal amount of conpreorder  all are as new and have just been in my previouslyplanned base bag for a while
  i wanna sell all my merch off but the facebook group doesnt allow advertising  isnt there a partnered sales group
  theres some aliexpress merch in there  aka stolen fanart just throw that shit in the trash in future dont buy merch from aliexpress
  fair point it was bought a while ago so i was less aware of the fact  isnt ali sometimes resells of taobao merch though is that still stealing    im not sure ill have a look though thanks
  here is mine sorry the layout isnt the best i want to revamp it at some point perhaps when i get more merch    the other anon was right though when it comes to laws popularity a lot of my stuff was really expensive like the bear plush was around 40 usd his lottery badges from the mugiwara store can sometimes go for over 10k yen on yjp and thats for one badge       the fb group has a sister group for sales and its linked in the rules section
  its already bad taste to buy stolen art if youre still trying to resell them then youre that one asshole everyone is gonna hate
  trash or give away the aliexpress stuff sell the rest
  taobao is just like aliexpress sellers there arent the original artists either
  plenty of artists get together to open up stores anon and scalped / stolen
  there is plenty of taobao original fanmerch of course they should try to figure out if it actually is original or not before reselling but ive bought danganronpa merch from chinese artists that sell via taobao
  i actually like the fabric you picked
cant figure out what color fabric to use for my inserts for prompto ffxv and ryuji persona 5 should i go with yellow for a pop of color or stick with red/black should i stick to using cotton so the fabric doesnt sag or are there other fabrics that i can use base bag for both is black
  i love it thanks for sharing damn thats a cute little bear
  does your prompto merch have a specific consistent color i dont know what merch you have but i feel that making an insert with plaid fabric to mimic the plaid fabric on his jacket could be really cool maybe even take the time to add little studs on the outside of the bag for extra detail to again emulate his outfit but thats just an idea
  this is the merch ive collected so far the only outlier is the button i had considered studs and even using some of his patches on the insert to make up for the lack of official merch because the bag has a large window plaid sounds like a really good idea but id have to scrap the patches idea to keep the bag from getting too busy right
  oh fuck please excuse the sideways pic im not near a computer right now
  the patches could make it look cluttered if you place them inside the bag with the merch but what you can do instead is place them outside on the back of the bag to make it double sided  one side with the window and merch the other with patches and studs again just an idea and id say it has potential to also be cluttered and clunky but its really up to you
buying pins for my bag  seller has a condition where i need to order at least two things  fine  buys another item that i can resell for the highest price  items arrive  list the unwanted item  no ones biting  come the fuck on
  what series/character
  just accept your fate anon or make a friend with someone who likes the series token rejects i have a friend who likes an unpopular character and i sell her my extra merch at a discount i make some money back and she doesnt have to pay out of her nose in fees
cant wait for all the shitty kaworu and kawoshin bags that get made now since new kids are getting into eva now
  im actually planning on doing a kawoshin bag because of the eva colon set it doesnt seem like any kids are gonna get into eva until like 40 comes out 200 years later though
  it doesnt seem like any kids are gonna get into eva until like 40 comes out 200 years later though  netflix is distributing the show world wide
  oh yeah forgot about that i still kinda doubt it honestly because most kids who make shitabags are generally more into crunchyroll only shit or at least im just hoping because eva is my favorite anime
  anon id totally buy the top left two from you i wanted to buy them in a preorder but they closed before i could
finally got the bag im really excited
  i got too excited that i forgot the picture my bad
  those bags are so cute i wish the orange one didnt have such mismatched straps/zippers or else i would have gotten one in a heartbeat the blue looks great though do let us know how you like it anon
not gonna lie never been so happy to see someone use a bootleg until i came across this bag
  this is super cute would you mind spoonfeeding since i cant read the tag the size looks great
sorry for the crappy photo light is quite crap and reflects on the merch im having some issue finding a decent layout for this and was wondering if anyone had suggestions on how i can improve it also what would you suggest for an insert im finding that the merch is a bit drowned out with all the purple but im unsure what sort of color or pattern to use
  i thought about replicating their futons pattern on fabric and using that as a bg but im unsure
  fuck that would be kawaii af  do it
  this image caused my depression
   ignores the person who gave you crit after you asked for it    fuck off back to facebook you piece of shit
  no point listening to the anons crit to begin with the bag is dreadful to the core and an insult to danganronpa baggers you cant fix trash no matter how hard you try leave them in the denial
literally no official buttons pins lanyards or keychains  only ever seen one fan keychain made before  time to comission a fuckton of art i guess
    this is so embarrassing please find another site because no one over 18 would be this mad about a danganronpa ship and you could have at least tried to change the typing style from your other posts
hi anons i was wondering if anyone might have some pictures of their favorite couplethemed itabags im working on a couple of otp bags and kind of struggling so i was hoping to get some ideas from others     thank you in advance
    i dont know how to do reviews but really like the bright color and how consistent it is the texture/white part i have a feeling that itll get dirty easily i expected like a different material i like that its basically the size of my hand 7ish inches for the whole bag and the window is roughly 5ish inches i havent actually used it yet but it seems like you can put your essentials in
  sorry i was wondering what the brand was
  oh my bad kawaguchi they do a lot of stationery merchandise apparently i cant remember their home website 
  oh their website is right here wwwkwgccojp
    obvious samefag is obvious
  wwwkwgccojp  thanks a ton the review is much appreciated too

  have you ever gone on breaks from the hobby  currently on one long one right now    ever had a moment where a great/grail item popped up but you couldnt get it due to circumstances  a few times mostly due to budget constraints but its nbd    how are the holidays affecting your buying habits and mail  i havent been buying merch the past few months so holidays havent changed anything for me    did you get anything for yourself for the holidays  hah i wish like op my wallet is being used for christmas shopping for others    are you in canada and wanting to flip off the canadian post  thank god no but i feel bad for the ones who do live there
  i knew some dumbass would reply with this  you think theyre sending international mail to a burning post office  plus all the major warehouses are in the south where the fires are not
  there was multiple fires anon both in the north and in the south the biggest one was in the north but the ones in the south were no joke either stop being a dumbass
  youre not wrong but those fires also didnt burn down the mail sorting centers the airports or the seaports  isnt the slowdown just because postthanksgiving  peak season especially with online shopping
what is the best way in displaying smaller nesoberis   i been trying to figure out a way too and i cant decide
  stack them
    i dont really like one piece  go to japan   well fuck     how did this happen
  have you ever gone on breaks from the hobby  im on hiatus right now mostly because i was focusing on the fact that i had student loan payments starting soon but im slowly starting to get back into the groove of things    ever had a moment where a great/grail item popped up but you couldnt get it due to circumstances  nothing of the sort yet most of the time i just come across listings that have already sold    how are the holidays affecting your buying habits and mail  since i havent been buying much at all recently theres not too much of a change aside from being more gift focused    did you get anything for yourself for the holidays  not yet but ive been playing with the idea of finally biting the bullet and getting one of my grail figures since i have some wiggle room monetarily right now    are you in canada and wanting to flip off the canadian post  im not but im praying for all the canadian gulls/baggers that have to deal with that bullshit
  massive peak shipping is a contributing factor but of course the fire is the main reason just because the airports havent burned down doesnt mean their service isnt heavily affected people need to evacuate take care of their families follow emergency protocol their lives are more important than your package
  loves t law  you are the worst kind of one piece fan
  leaves comments like this  you are the worst kind of anon
  yeah but its the lesser of the two evils
why are people taking low quality bait    have you ever gone on breaks from the hobby  i had a two year long hiatus where i didnt really have a favorite other than that i dont think so but i do have months where im just too busy to work on my bag  ever had a moment where a great/grail item popped up but you couldnt get it due to circumstances  never because my grail never pops up  how are the holidays affecting your buying habits and mail  i dont go crazy or hold myself back just because its the holidays mail slow as hell though im preparing for my november amiami order to arrive in january  did you get anything for yourself for the holidays  technically yes but amount of merch i got for myself isnt really special compared to any other month   are you in canada and wanting to flip off the canadian post  no
  but sorry its his hat and sexy face and tight jeans and bad boy attitudeok its all of him you cant help love the ones you love
  whats not to love im still bummed he wont have a way to join the crew officially boo
  damn lol i wasnt attacking the mail workers for a slowdown i just disagree on the reasons
taken from すぅべっちs youtube channel  i feel like their technique for this was actually really genius and the lights and deco dont distract from whats being displayed   merry christmas
  ornaments as decoration  genius ill definitely have to use that
any hypmic baggers here i just took some interest in the series and a certain character but i havent delved into the fandom so im curious are any characters super popular/have a high character tax
anyone feel like itabag is dying in the west simply because theres nothing new to bag for everythings either ending or dying down and theres nothing to fill the vacuum
  i dont see it but i guess that depends on the content you get exposed to on social media me my friends and other people i follow make their own bags not necessarily of new or trendy things but all the same
  you can bag series that have ended or died down too you know    shitty bandwagoners just got bored when they realized putting bootlegs in a bootleg bag is frowned upon and you actually need to put effort in things in this hobby
  i dont bag for it personally but right now the entire series is super popular in japan and is gaining popularity in the states i think both doppo and hifumi are both the most popular with doppo having the highest chara tax i see a ton of ramuda collectors too
im starting to feel like ill never be able to track down an utapri backpack id kill for the dark green one  how are your grail hunts going if you have one
  damn that bag is goals im glad to hear jakurai isnt the most expensive at least hes the one i want to collect for
   there is one on mercari search 寿 嶺二        lilac bags are so aestheticly pleasing
  i mostly track tags and communities i feel like theres been a slow down of new content compared to same period of time previous years granted i refer to popular english fandoms not idol franchises      except more people bag for something they actively care about in the moment people have complained in these very threads that their bnha splits arent being claimed as fast guess what bnha isnt doing airing  bandwagoning as distasteful as everyone say it is is still a way to introduce new blood to the hobby hell i was one of these bandwagoners until my heart settled on a character
get some extra money from work decide to do christmas shopping for myself  theres an influx of new merch what a timing  order some badges and keychains satisfied with my haul  couple of days later see a bunch of stuff starting at 1yen start bidding just for shit and giggles  end up going to a bid war anyway pay 800yen for multiple pieces each  okay no more items  see an item a friend has been looking for decide to buy it as a present  okay no more items  see a rare badge for a cheap prize buy that too  okay no more items  okay one more badge  end up spending 40 more than i originally planned to    why am i like this
  this is a mood
  i just managed to grab a red one in my last haul and im so excited to get it    i also managed to grab my holy grail of all items and still in its packaging as well im torn about opening it once it comes
  i just found a bromide on mercari that ive been hunting for months i have a massive order about to ship out and mercari is such a pain to order from but im probably still going for it
  its not minoringo its kawamori btw
  from my personal searches doppo gentaro and ichiro seem to be taxed the most i just started my collection for jakurai a few months back im glad to hear someone else loves him too

wtb horror candy shop jsk in red looking to spend 260 usd  shipping i know its still in stock on ap usa but not interested in their inflated prices
  lol
  poorfag detected
  just looking for the dress at the price it was listed on ap jp when it went on sale the usa site is still listing it for full price
  dont reply to crossboarding trolls theres a reason why no one replied to them
  you just missed out get over it youre probably one of the people who think you can get the same price as the japanese market overseas too
  sorry but if dresses on the japanese market are  and the same dresses on the western market are  then someones scalping and it should be unacceptable
  thats not how that works dresses cost more in the west due to the extra costs associated with import taxes ss fees shipping costs etc different markets value pieces differently depending on tastes between the two as well scalping is buying low with the sole purpose of selling high not pricing for the target market
  why has /cgl/ been so obsessed with scalping recently do the gulls complaining about scalping expect the price for a print to go down every time its sold secondhand if somebody sells a dress for 100 dollars then a few months later a different person sells the same dress not the one the other person sold for 150 is that scalping now what if the seller doesnt know how to buy from the japanese market are they a scalper for not keeping up with japanese market prices     all that aside by your logic ap usa is also scalping for selling it for  and not putting it on sale too because japanese ap sold it for 
wtb  navy x gold or navy x black diamond otks any brand need them for ild so us seller preferred
  the jp store had a sale and this anon was too dumb to get it at that price and they want to undercut it their price is not what the ap jp store sells it for
    mfw i wanna buy like everything youre selling but im in europe and my fucking customs are killer
  im not even defending that anon tho lmao
  ill declare lower values for you if you need it just know that that does waive your insurance coverage but you will get full tracking
  i wish i had the ability to buy the hospitility doll set from you but i wouldnt even be able to unless it was on a payment plan and im sad because its my grail     i hope some anon finds it a good home
  anon its only 400 dollars save up beforehand if it really is your grail   i dont know why but everytime someone sells hospitality doll there are at least two anons whining about how they cant afford it
  i just paid for like two other dream dresses thats why im bitching i had it before this popped up i know ill have to wait im just a lil salt    sigh its just how the world goes
  just checked the measurements 76cm waist and 94cm bust its up to you if youd like it but id say its definitely on the larger side of their size 2 pieces
  is the victorian maiden op still available     im very tempted by it but it looks pretty long in stock images and with some of the listed measurements im afraid it might swallow me    im 55 81 cm bust and 635 cm waist
current on my high priority wtb list please shoot me an email if you want to get rid of any of these i missed out on some of them on mercari recently and im so mad
  shit put my email in the wrong field
  yes its still available its not super long im 59 and it hits just above my knees the measurements are a little larger though i have a 90cm bust and it fit comfortably so whereas its not too long it is a little roomier than vm usually is
  what if the seller doesnt know how to buy from the japanese market  that doesnt keep someone from knowing how much something goes for in yen
would anyone be interested in buying these theyre both brand new the fairy tales one even still has the tag on it i tried to get into lolita a few years ago and i just forgot about these im not even sure how much to price them i just want them gone

  here is an imgur album with a bunch of pictures im kind of retarded when it comes to identifying different cloths but the one they used for this release is rather heavy/warm and a little stiffer stitching and details are pretty well put together however          my apologies i forgot the beret and socks they released with princess cat were called different things    its the dolly lady ribbon beret in wine      and princess dot otks in wine

  are you taking offers or would you be willing to sell just the jsk ill understand if you dont want to
  yeah if i cant get a trade
  id rather not break any sets unless someone is already offering to buy the socks  beret    im willing to take offers depending on the piece but 320ish is what the wine version of princess cat is going for with just the headbow so i think its a reasonable price and probably wont go lower then that for the set to be frank    individually id be willing to part with the jsk for 290 socks for 30 and beret for 40
  would you take a payment plan for the set
  sure we might be able to work something out can you email me with details like how long you would need it for thanks

inb4 you can never be too old    no seriously how old do you have to be before it just starts to look creepy and sad
honestly as long as you keep the age of the characters youre cosplaying in line with your own eg leaving teenage fotm characters to the actual teens you can theoretically keep it up your entire life there are certain characters who really do benefit from an older looking cosplayer
i think it depends on your substyle  sweet is probably fine until youve got distinct wrinkles  classic and gothic are probably fine no matter how old you are people will just look at you like a renaissance/ww1 reenactor/etc  and then once youre 70 you can wear sweet again its just silly and cute and people will think youre harmlessly senile
  i would say the same older ladies can look very nice in classic as long as they have bras that fit and have kept at least slightly in shape that one lolita whose mom dressed in classic is such fucking goals wish my gram would wear one of my long iw dresses and go to tea with me   tfw the old bird hated dresses even when she was young and detests milk in her tea   a gull can dream i guess
as long as you adjust your style and tastes to better suit your age then theres no limit     sweet for babby noobs classic for women whove matured in style and gothic for the hags whove got retirement to blow before planning their moitie funerals     personally i plan on quitting once i crap out my first troll im not going to be that freak outcast mom at pta meetings
  im hoping a significant number of lolitas stay childless spinsters so we can be roommates and look after each other as we get older
  going to pta meetings even once    there are plenty of lolita moms you just have to be careful which pieces you wear around the kids or teach them not to fuck with your stuff having mom friends who like your style happens
lolita is fashion its just clothes theres no age limit
  id say above 25 and you are just creepy especially for men
  25 how old are you
  this anon gets it      you must be 18 to use this board
  id be open to the idea if my fiance didnt want kids while all my friends and younger siblings are already having them       i know a few and thats great and all but personally its just not for me both mine and my fiances family are very supportive of me being in lolita they love it on me and are always encouraging me while my fiance gives me a monthly budget for brand but i cant see either side thinking its very mature or responsible to continue it while having kids and especially if i decide to be a stay at home mom     my comm has several moms in it and we make most meets family friendly to accommodate them as most are strapped for cash and cant afford babysitters they get no leisure at meets because their attention is focused only on their kid and arent able to converse or get to know anyone financially im fine but i never want to end up in that awkward situation plus i dont want my kids friends parents looking me up on social media before a slumber party to make sure im not some psycho criminal and discovering my lolita photos and immediately assuming i must be some gross ageplay whore id hate for my kids to go through anything awful because of my frivolous hobby
just chiming in that i dont think the woman in ops picture looks creepy or sad just in case she lurks    im in my 30s and i still happily wear lolita im lucky that i dont look older than my mid20s i guess but i know this wont last forever   i dont like flashy sweet so my wardrobe is already kind of mature by lolita standards    and as for cosplay just stay within your age bracket with the characters you choose let the whippersnappers dress as idols and cutesy things we have our own options
depends on how you look imo    like when i think older i think of that dumpy middle age weight distribution/gain if you can keep your figure and keep up your skincare youll look great regardless there will always be haters but i dont think you have to look young to look good in lolita you just have to not look dumpy and saggy    ive seen girls in their early 20s who look rough and dumpy already and girls in their late 30s/early 40s who look amazing
  i just had my salpingectomy done last month ill be a child free lolita forever
ive written a whole blog post on this but the short answer is the only limit you have is the one you give yourself as long as you feel happy wearing lolita or cosplaying you should definitely keep doing that signs of age mean nothing unless you give them a meaning old / ugly having a hobby could actually help you age well
no age limit as long as you are pretty    if one woman would be just as cute as anzu she could be 40 and i would see no problem
  tfw 25 but look 16  ill get away with cosplay forever
  this for cosplaying the answer is simply to keep picking older characters as you get older and youll never get too old
i kinda feel sorry for people limiting themselves with age like this i mean im in my late 30s i look about 25 and no i dont pull off a teen anymore but why should i stop having fun just because im not impressing someone or living up to their standards i cosplay the characters i like because i like them any attention i get is just a bonus but im doing this for myself first and foremost ill never have the body i want for half my dream cosplays but its also a fun challenge to craft and use makeup to get as much detail right as i can i have aged myself to be old people and dressed as teens ive done monster costumes and armor im nobody special there are people whose work blow me out of the water but you know what im having fun and i wont be stopping any time soon do what makes you happy its only when you cant enjoy it anymore that you probably might want to reevaluate why youre in the hobby
tfw 24 and feel like an old spinster
  this dont try to cosplay 14yo as a 40yo and youre fine adults cosplaying as adults characters teenagers cosplaying as teenagers characters boomers cosplaying as boomers characters it works    and personally seeing someone older like 50 cosplaying is more wholesome than anything else
  damn you really have a boner for anzu the anachan dont you
  i really like your mindset  id like to add yes youll look bad in some specific styles/coords and cosplays we all have things that dont suit us because bodytypeage you can still do it thono ones stopping you even though i recommend minding those things because you kinda wanna have fun while knowing you look good yanno in the end if you have fun hey thats all that matters were all nerds in costumes and silly clothes at the end of the day
  same here
  yea she perfect
  not to white knight anzu but she admitted she has a love/hate relationship with food awhile back on tumblr which i admire her for its something most actual lolitas and cosplayers are hesitant to admit
art by artmady on fb
  most actual lolitas and cosplayers are hesitant to admit    why is this admirable to admit not saying the opposite is or isnt but peoples mental and physical health isnt the publics business and its up to the individual how open they want to be online
  old lolitas especially the ones with grey hair always get positive reactions
  skin depends much more on genetics than skincare
  i actually think it would be really fun to see old/adult versions of characters
  because if you dont say something publicly then salty gulls speculate and rip you apart in /cgl/
  santa claus all right
  protip from an oldfag if youre older and getting that middleaged bod do work out but also invest the price of a new brand dress and accessories in a good quality custommade corset do your research read lucys corsetry and make all the youngsters in your comm wonder how you do it
  no seriously how old do you have to be before it just starts to look creepy and sad  7
  more people should do this desu especially if youre near the top of the shirring range of a dress a corset will usually reduce your measurements but will help smooth any lumps and avoid the sausage effect you can get with shirring
  im an idiot meant to say  especially if youre near the top of the shirring range of a dress a corset wont necessarily reduce your measurements by much but will help smooth any lumps and avoid the sausage effect you can get with shirring
  nayrt but if you wear a corset for at least an hour or two every day or every other day your uncinched waist measurement will shrink as well when i was wearing 50cm corsets every day my natural waist went from 61cm to 55cm within a couple of months pic related is ethel granger in her 60s or 70s
  classic and gothic can still look good into your thirties you should stop wearing sweet around the time you enter secondary school though
  i plan on quitting once i crap out my first troll  godi cant wait to you introduce another snarky asshole just like yourself if thats how you see it dont bother having kids you moron you can always not do that ya know
  we make most meets family friendly to accommodate them as most are strapped for cash and cant afford babysitters  this sounds horrifying on every level holy fucking shit
  nayrt but jesus christ calm down its called a sense of humor people in their 20s right now are surrounded by a majority of friends who aggressively dont want children and unironically use such language to describe kids its extremely normal for someone who wants kids to mockingly use the same
  i mean if youre really old man tier just off the top of my head you could try uncle iroh gandalf dumbledore obiwan old snake bill from l4d geralt old ezio professor oak 3rd hokage jiraiya master roshi theres plenty of older characters that are good cosplay material
  i dont want kids either but its because i know better that other anon is treating it like pushing one out is the obligation of life which tells me they probably dont actually want the kid they just want that parent lifestyle which sucks ass for the kid
when im dead
  damn i never thought about it before but literally all my favourite characters are old men
  they just want that parent lifestyle  like its glamorous at all i highly doubt that
  i know better  parenting as a lifestyle aesthetic     i think youre 14 and a fucking idiot
    that rib cage to waist to hip ratio is creeping me out though it makes her top look boxy and her hips look huge i wonder how strong her spine is for that matter
i wish the 35 year old grannies would stop with the sexy cosplays    like its cool if you want to still play dress up and go to cons but no one wants to see your saggy tits and ass anymore
  ive seen girls in their early 20s who look rough and dumpy already and girls in their late 30s/early 40s who look amazing  trufax taking care of yourself and by this i mean actually eating properly and exercising a bit anachans need not apply really does set you apart in your late 20s onwards skin is a bit of a genetic lottery but theres a lot more to looking presentable that simply looking youthful eg        implying anzu will live to 40      t h i s
     phrased it badly but it does sound like  from how she describes who should dress as what really ascribes to social norms of how people should act and applies that logic to silly anime dresses she might also feel that obligation to have a child and judging from how she half jokes about not wanting to be an outcast mom at pta meetings may crave social acceptance    but hey its one post on an armenian swimming board i might be completely wrong but its fun to point out why one post gives that impression
  this pic  is ethel granger the woman with the smallest proven waist yes she looks super weird that was her goal most people who wear corsets dont look like that it is very possible to wear a corset for the smoothing effect rather than for waist training or high reductions the girl in this pic  for example is naturally pearshaped with large breasts the corset does smooth out her shape and make it look dramatic but i wouldnt say it makes her look boxy or crazy like ethel when it comes to lolita its better to think of a corset in the way historical reenactors do rather than waist trainers or tightlacers it provides a strong shape for your clothes to lay over pic related is from a very good blog post about this by the pragmatic costumer heres a link 
      that was an interesting read thanks i can see how some larger chested girls might want one but for me ill pass im mostly concerned about what the article addressed about wearing them often and muscular strength in the core relying on the corset all day lets your muscles become lax and given that most lolita isnt super heavy theres not a lot of need for it to support the weight i do get why it works for some people but its not for me
  what the fuck hahaha the majority of lolitas are in their 20s because thats the age in which a lot of people become financially stable     something tells me that youre a babby that relies on mummy and daddy to buy your clothes and so you think eww only teenagers can cosplay/wear lolita fashion please get off this board and come back when youre of age to
  stop wearing sweet by the time you enter secondary school  stop  enter secondary school    im sorry so by the age of 11 or 12
  im 26 so by those standards i guess i better start penning my will and testament should i leave my burando to my nieces lmao
when you stop feeling comfortable wearing it the reason why everyone loves the jolly green lady is because she wears what she wants and it makes her happy not because society tells her to if youre confident in wearing what you like people admire you even if you look crazy to them people always want what they cant have that includes being content and happy with yourself
  amen
  based
  im waiting on second consultation to get mine wish me luck
  read one very old and well known article you hadnt heard of til today and suddenly be an expert     if youre wearing a corset all day every day your muscles can atrophy if youre wearing it for part of a day under a specific dress youre actually doing quite a lot of abdominal work and nobody has any business at all wearing an overbust corset with lolita the shape is completely wrong wear an underbust and a proper bra     i also dont think you understand what anon means by strong shape but whatever thats enough spoonfeeding for you
  it is to some people yeah i think theyre fucking sad as hell but some people see it as a right of passage to make friends with their peers who are also popping out kids because thats just what you do in your 30s      no im 31 and not having children as i can make my own decisions regardless of what other assholes are doing      nailed it
  god good luck anon if you havent already i recommend checking out the childfree reddit and looking at their list of cf friendly doctors     i approached my family doctor who reffered me to someone and thankfully i received no push back i was pleasantly surprised with not having to fight about it
  i think that anon was making a joke about how sweet looks like childrens clothing
  look at yayhan she is around 40 yrs old  just pick cosplays that work for that age as other anons said
  yaya looks rough irl though but i praise her for her love of crafting
  live in a free society  people still complain about how you spend your free time and money  learn how to mind your business you nosy old bitch
  you good anon can kindly shove a parasol as far up your ass as itll go  love  a 27 year old lolita
  look at yaya han  spoken like someone whos never actually seen her irl
  anon do you need a hug wanna talk about something you seem hurt
pic fuckin related
  meme poster  why do i sound hurt because i dont want to have kids and the thought of some snooty bitch bringing an unwanted child into the world is irresponsible but noooo  i must be personally offended    i feel bad for her future kid my dude that kids life is gonna suck
  nayrt but yeah anon you sound pretty personally upset by this did you have parents that didnt want you that poster is already planning to be deeply involved in her childs school life pta is a lot of work its pretty clear that she wants her future kids
  guys its ok this person is clearly not even a lolita or a man
  did you mean look at this shooped pic of yaya han shes a beautiful woman but she does look her age in unedited videos pictures and irl      agree to be honest i dont think someone who genuinely wanted a kid would talk about them that way
its creepy and sad when youre ugly and you can be ugly at any age
  you might change your mind if/when you do have children i quit lolita for a while after having a baby and desu i just really missed it and ended up deciding to wear it again you dont have to be like those moms in your comm make sure youre in a good place financially before having a kid so you can afford to get a babysitter and go out and have fun occasionally you absolutely cannot completely dedicate your life to being a mom and only a mom it seems admirable in theory but it will kill you inside trust me you need and deserve hobbies too i dont bring my kid to meets he goes to grandmas and i get a break win win all around its totally possible to keep your life as a lolita and your life as a mom separate and enjoy both although i will say im very open about my weird fashion choices and have never gotten any negative reactions but hey you do you you wont know what you really want until you get there
  personally i plan on quitting once i crap out my first troll im not going to be that freak outcast mom at pta meetings  pta moms dont need to know what your hobbies are    i cant imagine giving up lolita just because i had a kid i made a lot of friends thanks to the fashion and going to meets is like me time so it keeps me sane but you do you friendo
  that person categorizes the fashion by age do you even wear lolita
  i disagree i think theres charm to ugly girls in lolita who wear the fashion for themselves because it makes them feel beautiful regardless of how old they are
  sure girl sure
  i agree if you look back to oldschool its pretty evident that the original look was meant to come off as a bit quirky or unhinged the true doll like look didnt set in until ott sweet took over but before when gothic was the dominate substyle the look was more about the contrast of a ordinary girl in a modern world wearing something that looks out of place
  35 now and when i look at my comm 80 are my age and without kids and not planning on having them either  i guess we will keep having our tiny tea parties for the upcoming years
there is an old lady who goes to the dances i go to  shes gotta be pushing 80  and she wears a lolitaish not actually true lolita style     she looks glorious
i just turned 30 and just put together my first coord classic yes but thats literally always been my style anyway     also fanny rose is 30 sooooooo ya know whatever wear pretty things then die
i mean misako aoki the queen of all lolitas is 36 she stills wears sweet lolita and looks amazing i think if you have the right personality and dont look too wrinkly you can get away with it for a long time there is also a more toned down sweet that fits most ages i think its just clothes everyone can wear what they feel compfortable in
  can i join anon
there is no age limit you fucking normiessss reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

dont forget the current contest theme is isekai and you have less than 2 days to submit its a very easy theme if you try i wont lock the prizes behind a certain amount of entrants for this round since theres been low participation but i will for the next one so watch out  see  for details  see  for prizes bonus option for this round is small pixel art    current entrants     and  as a joke but i suggest you at least try an alice entry    also post what you entered for the dg flower theme fashion contest
  wheres the option for no clothes
  as a joke  i actually thought it was a really good idea given the recent events     but since you thought it was just a joke that means it has no chance of winning so here goes another
    wrong layer
  when she arrived to candyland she was hailed as their sweet jesus  they were wrong
  giving steven another chance  just give him the green card
  show by rock was the best only isekai ive ever watched
i wish theyd make the grand reward related to the theme
the winner of isekai is  i thought it was cute and clever to turn a peaceful bookreading outfit to something else by using the magic accessory the jungle frame even naturally looks like its lit up in the yellow glow without the edit in case anyone complains i only judge the coords so the story and edit were not a part of it as cute as they were come hiroshi tell us our next theme you can tell me what you want for the prize here or in dg messages      shes super cute and i like the idea but i think it needs some pizazz maybe an accessory and another expression showing how shes overwhelmed with our technology      whaaat you play db kotori looks great as a dude and that accessory and concept are funny looks like a normal outfit otherwise though      very cute and a solid isekai entry another one that could perhaps use an accessory maybe show what shes photographing or also use effects to show shes been teleported      oh i thought you were giving in to the meme from people complaining about that outfit and didnt notice the chain of replies where you explained yourself however i think this is much more fitting and im glad you tried again its even isekaiception because its not alice      cute she certainly looks like an invader i want to go to candyland too      theres no doubt youve watched more if not anime then a film the west just doesnt have a term for going to another world yet they do it a lot and label it fantasy extremely lovely way to turn a sweet rock outfit to cyber i like the phone as an added touch since its a mobage too      this is my favorite other than hinami it was hard to decide between the two rose looks great as a knight and her speech is funny i had to pick hinami because i liked the use of effects with her outfit    it was fun seeing all of these please keep entering the contests
  giving in to the meme  i actually complained about it to sunny but that doesnt mean i didnt think it was a good idea     doing your best and losing is worse than not trying and losing
  shut up steven
  hooray thanks    i suppose id like the theme to be autumn maybe its early autumn and most trees are still green or maybe its late autumn and your girl is catching the last of the falling leaves    and not necessarily just autumn but autumn activities in autumn you can roll around in the leaves and decorate the house for the different holidays its cooking time for the homemakers and harvest time for the farmers    the animals are especially very busy preparing for winter    does your girl love or hate autumn what does she do in the cooling shortening days    bonus points if you can make something catrelated appear but only if it makes sense no shoehorning it wont have any bearing on the decision but i love cats so i couldnt resist    pic unrelated      
  
  seconding the speech in this entry i love it      what can be prizes again o    pic yet again unrelated
    the person that  picks as winner will also be able to receive 1 of the following prizes   love letter   green card   enter into a drawing to win another prize   short fic about your girl/boy taking you out   short fic about your girl/boy giving you headpats   summoning ritual for dead masters  i recommend the green card
  someone sure is a grumpygoober      what can be prizes again  yeah the stuff in  or again a small pixel art this round only since i couldnt give a prize in that last round you guys can suggest any other similar prizes to be added to the options as well other short stories silly shoops etc

  and id like to vote for you but i dont know what to be on the lookout for      cute smart move if you removed chous eyepatch for this because youd figure it would turn voters off why does she wear the eyepatch anyway
  why does she wear the eyepatch  because its extremely painful when she takes it off
      2017 where
  she usually wears the eyepatch because she doesnt like showing her left eye to others
  like nakatsu shizuru from rewrite
  
  the gimmick was inspired by the kazekoshi captain from saki though  i would have liked to have her wink all the time but since its not possible i have to use an eyepatch plus its kind of like gap moe so its fine
  i want to kaze her koshis
  as with the occupational fashion contest i didnt think my girls normal designs would make the cut so shi got an aryan makeover and a height boost    thanks goes to oneesama for letting me make a naoki clone    the mr i picked has its floral accessories mostly hidden behind the frame but it exposes enough of the bg and compliments the peonies so that i hope the overall composition combined with its rarity will propel it to rank
  this is what i ended up entering having last minute thoughts about changing things though like her hairstyle
  cant help but feel like the yandere eyes and lipstick mouth are a mismatch with the cutesy theme
  whew milk truck just arrive
    i thought fairies were supposed to be small
  she mustve gotten pollinated a lot growing up now shes borne some very large fruits
  whos dead
posting halloween collage and not the bench collage    smh    
  but most of them are just hidenoris recommendations
opinions on the contest winners
  not too fond of this but ill take it if they give it out for free
  i would fond you out for free
  so tired of the frills
voting is painful
here is hiroshis requested prize
    im satisfied and the deer was one of my favorites itll be nice if they also include the lower face highlight accessory since it would be good for other candle/lantern outfits without using the animu terrified face shadows      coord and hair are great that mr is unique and one of my regrets on not being able to get but i agree with       i was considering using that body too but i was worried the flowers on it wouldnt look noticeable enough on the small voting pages and the most noticeable plant on there is just wheat it does look lovely though youve had that hair on amaranth forever so just keep it and get the date shop blonde ahoge like you wanted
    ohhhh no its so cute omg thank you        this is the gacha bonus jp has right now
  was only thinking about changing it for the contest ended up getting distracted by soulcalibur though so i forgot all about it maybe its because im the one that entered it i can tell where all the flowers are even on the entry check page at least it still looks better than most ive seen while voting been getting flashbacks to the randomizer in the last anniversary event    im looking at this in the builder and starting to warm up to it but i wish wed gotten the overall mr set in the latest jp event instead as the bonus
  ill just resubmit this from one of our other autumn contests was gonna make an oktoberfest entry but too busy someone else please go ahead and try it
theres only a few entries so far so dont forget if you want prizes you gotta participate im talking to you people who never enter its been the people who usually enter regardless right dont you want something special this time ill take 7 entries to unlock prizes the options are the stuff thats been reposted plus whatever else you have in mind thats easy no art or sprites til further notice
hey guys its your favorite collage maker here saying that ill make a halloween collage this year just submit your girls in this thread and ill place them in the collage i would go through the /mkg/ list and grab them myself but that place is a graveyard now so go ahead and submit your girls here and be quick because you only have till the 30th at 9 pm pst
  1 never collaged before  2 can we use maker images or only what we actually have ingame  3 can we shoop their hair the right color
  yes just send him something like this either use the builder or the viewer because they must be the same size
  this is why having different resolutions/sizes wouldnt work for the collage
  thank you o helpful one
custom cast updated   added clothing parts and poses halloween update so to say
ranked in the 1500s  at least i got the background the hat is useless though
forgot to replace placeholder entry  somehow ended up getting the outfit    huh cool
  at least i got a hat
ayy        yeah the reason i picked thin yandere eyes was because staring looked too bold with the heavy eyelashes and i didnt like how the heart pupils look with cat eyes i thought it was an advantage however small to go with np eyes over any of the shell ones the droopy pure eyed face would have been my preference if i owned it  my reasoning was the same for the mouth accessory i thought it would be an advantage to stand out since all the entries have the default expression i went with the lipstick mouth because its one of the only mouth changing accessories i have outside of the sleep stores ones if i had better luck with the accessory tickets from dating i would have used the open smiling mouth or the yandere mouth from it instead
is there a way to convert between the the url format for stuff used in dgs pc version and the numbers in the dgcreator or a compiled list of creator numbers to outfit name i ask because theres a few outfits that dont appear to be in game plus theres some used in scenarios or personality samples that youll never actually see the outfit id for    pic related is the outfit from the friendly personality sample pcs url parameters are blend_front_paramphp603id106w323z40jb0yi0w80f903d0tf0mw0uk495a51f1j1v5688d7l4m221id21p1id3191id40z1
  thanks
    blehhh i didnt care for the outfit much but its a free sr _ judging from the top voted the randos were on the lookout for the most buyfaggy mrs not sure why chou didnt do good since there are others with that dress in the top but it seems the randos also like sparkly clusterfucks its nice to see shi did so good despite being a clean coord
  could you wait until the 31
  you wouldnt discriminate against soul girls right
tfw you realize the roids you made teenagers when you first started are adults now
  tfw you realize the older 2d girls you liked are now too young for you
  i had entertained the thought of allowing my girls and boys to age up with each birthday but decided not to mainly because i dont want to deal with their personalityfashion changes do you have specific ages for yours
  if youre waiting for the ranking outfit from mcc youre gonna have to use the builder the 30th is a hard deadline sorry
  sounds like a collage with usada and colors
  the viewer is missing the option for the 6th myroid so no special face for airi
weve been on /cgl/ for a year now funny thing is that the theme was autumn then too
  10 threads in a year
  thanks as always hopper
  thank you senpai    insert butthurt comment about not being able to use the top 30 outfit     inb4  insert comment pointing out its not as fast and easy to get the ids as to select the costume in the closet
    /cgl/ was a mistake
  goodnight sweet prince
  i dressed up all my dgs for the season so i figured id post them   for the sake of the contest you can judge the one in the middle ruho
  i just realised that i forgot momikis glasses please ignore my previous mcc one
  thanks for doing this
i think i just unlocked a new fetish for knees
  am i late
    i like the idea of this and her face is hilariously cute with your story im imagining someone saying this is a bit much you know youre not asian right and her going shut up i know that why would you think otherwise etc i cant get over the background being the street though a japanese porch probably wouldnt open to the street so its pretty confusing      i actually really like this dress not sure why so i was happy to see it if only the back part of the body accessory wasnt there its so distracting either that or more colors other than orange and brown wouldve normalized the purple that bear peeking through the leaves creepily is pretty funny tho      it was interesting to see so much green in an entry for fall i wish theyd used colored pencils or something in the frame instead of crayons it makes a lot more sense you can draw a beautiful picture of a lady using colored pencils or pens or what have you but crayons are basically impossible to work with on a scale that small anyways i like the idea of fallception happening with the fall background the green is a little bit much for me though a little too bright
    man she has a lot to carry id be dropping shit everywhere a cat a book and 2 dango skewers and if youve ever had a cat on your shoulder you know they like to crawl around and fuck your shit up i hope you like tiny clawshaped scabs in your shoulders she looks pretty protected with all those layers though i actually dont know a ton about mcc outfits but id be surprised if the hair accessory didnt come with the outfit what with the matching blue/red and checker pattern i like the color balance a lot in this one orange being complimentary to blue helps lol       i wasnt expecting a db entry and to be honest i have zero familiarity with the items in that game i do like the colors the teal with the red and orange leaves is nice i wouldve liked to see his eye color though though i do like that it looks like hes laughing at whatever the person next to him just said or did      so many nice fall outfits i actually really like the 2nd girl she looks like shes snuggling that squirrel so lovingly 3 3 ruho since her eyes are more teal and there are bits of green on the dress i think a different hair accessory wouldve matched better but thats just like my opinion man those ribbons just add a lot of brown on top and honestly ive always thought they looked a bit weird because they sit on top of everything
      all of that said im picking this as the winner      as i mentioned i really like the balance of color in this one the orange in the corners being cut through with the navy of the sky and the hakama is really appealing not to mention the blue of her eyes as well and the orange of the cat my goodness arent we all matchymatchy maybe thats why im drawn to lolita fashion lol
  a day late and a dollar short but i havent participated in a while so even though this is pretty lastsecond these are mine sorry i kind of forgot the holiday was today
  jana makes me feel a lot of things but terror isnt one of them
  so just in case you arent done yet could you replace  with this
remember not to eat alot of candy tonight or else youll get a tummy ache
  thanks    i know i did a dog themed contest in the past but im doing another one because i like them the next theme is dog breeds    basically id like to see your girls personifying different dog breeds is your girl/boy a spoiled poodle a tough pitbull or a cheerful golden retriever show me your dog gijinkas i cant make one of my own because im at work but heres something similar to what im looking for  a pomeranian girl in this case     feel free to use whatever you can to portray the attitude and looks of your favorite breeds
  oh gosh my girls are in something aaa
  tfw i fell for the hard deadline meme again
  funny story note is my actual dog girl but i decided to not use her for this because i wanted to use francine i love dogs with big fluffy tails and small ears i like the pom breeds   any who heres my entry
  nice glad it didnt end up as small as i thought
  thats what she said
  
i lost my account when i got a new phone two years ago shit sucks
  mmetatron
  its tomoko retard
  dont kill my hopes like that anon
  you know you can message support for the id and pass right just give em proof you own the account like when you started how much ap or can you had etc
    who
  
    why are dgers such closed up assholes
  their game is shit they dont change their clothes they barely see their girls because all of them have the same ugly face
  their game is shit  they dont change their clothes  they barely see their girls because all of them are sleeping
see dialogue with myroids owned by friends who are long gone
  mcc has a same face problem imo all the girls look the same with the same eyes but thats in the eye of the beholder    why are mccers such assholes just because you think the game is better than dg disgusting
  mcc is better than your fapping excuse of a game    there is more diversity in the level 1 moen eyes than in your whole shop
    im active daily and i change their clothes every 10 days please come visit me    by the way the last contest theme only had 6 entrants we need 7 for the winner to be able to receive a prize partipate mcc has gotten animal gachas and events dg has a lot of animal ears ab literally has dog boys db must have something too pic not related
  first entry takes over a week to appear  is this truly the worst theme mkg has ever come up with
  i want to rape colors in a museum       yes
  i want to rest my head in colors hairy chest and have them tell me its all gonna be alright
  thats the second entry
  them
  isnt that first reply an example from the contest runner
  them      the first one is hiroshi
  hiroshi  lemme smash
  who
  yui
  whui
  which breed is this
  if you really wanna smash someone jaedens probably an easier target
  i have no idea im not a dog person
    what a shitty entry i cant believe its going to win
  tthank you for believing in me
  something is burning
  eye shapes are harder to make for dg because they have motion but keep that stick up your ass    ps mcc is fapbait too
  inferior fapbait
contests are two weeks now right
  mcc is fapbait too  no aside from oversized titties mcc is a pretty safe game the downside of this is that most outfits in mcc look like n to rr outfits from dg
  yes
  wow i see why i stopped playing mcc because you guys are total jerks
so far  has been the first to really capture the personality of a particular breed rottweilers are big tough strong dogs that can be sweet and cute but also have a reputation for being fierce with strangers much like a kindhearted delinquent     remember that some dog breeds were bred to do jobs i really would like to see more entries so i typed up a list to help with ideas    german shepherds  police military  dalmations  firefighters  huskies and samoyeds  sledding  collies and sheepdogs  herding livestock  hound dogs basset dachshund beagle  hunting and tracking  bloodhounds  detective work  greyhounds  racers  chow chow sharpei  guards  you can also take into account a particular breeds country of origin and personality
  what they stated an upside and downside of mcc that wasnt rude at all and you really shouldnt be here if you think it was
  they shouldnt be on 4chan if it offends them    can we not shit on games that make others happy just enjoy it why do you always have to shit on other games because you think theyre shit
  they  them
      aint even a sjw but i also automatically use they when im not concerned with/sure of the gender of the anon a lot of foreign languages have ambiguous pronouns for this reason probably
  use he like a normal person
  using he on /mkg/  half of the users are women at this point
    being this assblasted over pronouns   its like pottery
  half  more like 2/3
    were all cute girls just use she/her
  i like my penis too much to give up on it
  its 2018 cute girls can and should have penises
    fucking gross stop being a tard baby
  iim not cute
  colors wins lol  why bother entering
  you might be able to get enough yous to overpower the colors bias
  you say that like its a bad thing    all the best themes have been by colors
  colors pls
  steven has the best entry   he cant win because he is steven  colors must win because she is colors and that is what everyone is expecting
colors doesnt have to win if more people participate
  fuck off esteban
warning i dont give a fuck what you say i will recommend your boyroids big tit outfits
  amen
  i dont give a fuck what you say there are not such things as boyroids the most you can get is a futaroid if you purchase a fake penis in the black market
  tell me more about these black market penises
hey /mkg/ have you ever had your girls/boys drawn like fan art or requested them
  yes but i lost them when my old computer died 
  yes i really appreciate it
  yes several times in fact but that was a long time ago
  a few times some were commissioned and some were gifts
  i vomit
  the artist made kirara a bit chubby but im not going to complain about free art
  trash people have trash standards
  cute    shush you
    it is shit
how good is mcc/dg customer service my old tablet died and i havent been able to revive it yet but my transfer information is saved on there would contacting them help me get my account back
  mccs is pretty good dg is a bunch of bitches
  would contacting them help me get my account back  yes good luck
  from my experience dg support was good and mcc was hell
hello guys that one weirdo here to inform you that a game no one cares about had an update   custom cast updated adding new hair and poses
  a game no one cares about had an update  dg
  very funny jackass we get it you hate dg can you get more original jokes
  we
  who needs original jokes when the classics still get yous
who decent does my phone need to be to run dg
i like dg but the autistic anon who keeps losing his shit every time someone cracks a joke about it is making me want to shitpost about it even more
why are the current /mkg/ memes so shit
  what were the meta /mkg/ memes back in the day
  i miss metraton xd
  because mkg is near death and most of the fun people are gone
  kanamatric and botamochi memes
  making myroids in aa2
  myroid in need is a friend indeed   or something like that
  making fun of the attention whores
  this was fun
  posting your girls was the best meme back then
  i miss that meme
post your girls
        literally who
  it doesnt have to be super good disable the motion though      got a new phone and this looks so much better on a higher spec phone i know that should be a given but im still surprised    literally me
well there werent as many entries as i wouldve hoped so  is still my favorite and the winner of this theme i like it because of all the reasons mentioned previously i think it really does a good job portraying the fierce reputation of a rottweiler      this doesnt have a breed name but im guessing its a poodle definitely has that spoiled toy poodle feel but i think it could have been accessorized more still a good entry      this one didnt have any particular breed in mind and i can tell so even though the dress is cute it doesnt really fit the theme      very cute pom girl this is my second favorite i like the annoyed expression on her face since poms can be moody
    colors if you read this can you reset the theme to end on sunday instead of a midweek day
    thanks guys i had an automated email but apparently theyll get back to me soon hopefully everything works out
  thanks i love doggos    next theme is video hosts what would your girls and boys do if they were the host/creator of a tv show or online videos they could be a talk show host cooking host animal naturalist reviewer vlogger camwhore gamer etc you have til monday november 26      ive made it monday so that we only lose 2 days then maybe the next person can set it to sunday
  just extend it by four days senpai
  thats crazy and lazy
  colors idea is better usada took her sweet time deciding on her stupid themes winner
  please dont say i am lazy
  datte hontou wa crazy
  please dont say that either
  rude she took precisely 2 weeks which is proper it may have seemed long because you lazies didnt enter        damn you its in my head
  sun is a budding voice actor and it looks like her pets ambushed her right in the middle of practice
  good thing dg just had items for this theme i can actually enter this    ps live streaming your vacation is a bad idea
  shes chosen this theme for that reason so no one would have any excuses this time
has someone ever blatantly copied one or more of your girls/boys /mkg/ i dont mean they kind of look similar but holy shit this person copied the exact same eyes bangs personality and usual accessories i use   if that happened to you would you feel flattered or annoyed
  i used to do that pretty often when i was more active    my fifth may be a copy of sanhei if colors doesnt return
  ntr  gross
oh shit i forgot to check for the end date
  colors never left in the first place
  if she doesnt return to mcc
  actually made the theme sample a couple months ago was gonna be a more vague/broad theme the recent addition of those frames in dg gave me a better idea which is good since its less broad but if you dont have access to any of those type of frames then your entry does not need it      i already expressed i would strongly prefer you not do that plus now that i think of it again it would go against her backstory and her feelings  implying jpegs can feel    how about i make a similar grim loli oc for you instead ill use the rip to design her and post a bit about what shes like
  to be honest i dont think ill ever get to level 160
  kill yourself
its been some time since weve last had a cookingtype event in mcc whats the best recipe to follow
  none are particularly better  look at the ingredients and points three are sharafocused one weak one medium and one strong three are doc focused one weak one medium and one strong two are miyu focused one weak and one strong and one is equal to all  in terms of ingredients theres a few that are easier than others but theres basically the weak one for each of the three has a simple recipe the medium one for doc an shara is a bit more demanding in ingredients and the strong one for each of the three is very demanding    basically choose whichever suits your current needs the most you shouldve been able to tell all this easily if you actually looked at the recipes yourself
  people who play mcc are retarded
custom cast updated again   they added clothing parts a background some hair and a new snaggle tooth exciting right     maybe not but ill continue to do this unless im told to stop
  how much money do i need for this
  none
  search custom cast on qooapp and boom
  notify us when they let us fuck the girls
  just download cm3d2 if you want to fuck them
  wait you dont have your 5 girls i thought you mightve gotten her and was wanting a 6th wasnt it you who planned to have that tsundere looking dark twintail girl
  chrome i just had to get rid of wendy
    original chrome
  oh well then i have come up with a very cute 5th girl perfect for you  if youre interested i can post her
  sure go ahead     ill put her in the adoption spreadsheet though since i wont get her anytime soon even if i like her
  adoption spreadsheet  we have one of those    name horchata hor for short    backstory stevens girls take a vacation to mexico thinking they were on their way to tulum they somehow instead wound up in tijuana frightened and parched they head to a small stand with the sign aguas frescas de horchata the only thing they understood was horchata and they wanted one badly after asking for one the small girl running the stand said ay perras estúpidas horchata is my name im not good at making them but i do make a variety of aguas frescas the girls buy one and love it they loved it so much that they take horchata back home so that she can make the drinks for them any time    about blunt intelligent good at making certain refreshments sometimes malfunctions due to damage she received in mexico has a scar on her abdomen from having one robokidney stolen special character design accessory could be things like bandaid kanna shop braid scar etc
  thank you senpai but did you take into account im mexican
      its dead and i dont know how to edit the main spreadsheet but it should be either added to the main pastebin or a spreadsheet
  horchata is made out of rice or some nut not oranges      they went to a section of mexico that isnt a shithole
i want to get back into db due to my boy kaoru but my hate for the actual game event system and the hud is too stong v  //diary
itty and titty version of outfits  this new development pleases me
  tijuana is known for being a shithole    and she sells aguas frescas idiot that means more than one kind of water
  get both or just one
  hor  the jokes write themselves
  you can get both but youll have to pay twice the price
  hence why i made you a mexiroid i wasnt sure what aspects of sanhei youre a fan of so i made another smart/sardonic loli with short hair but without the black jack based design if you like sanheis stitches then again you could use the halloween scar accessory and say she got slashed in the face      this  she makes these fruity drinks but her hair is horchata color and yeah tijuana has one of the highest murder rates in the world a lot of mexicans want to go there because its right at the border and the beach which results in it being clustered with all sorts of people ive been to the border a few times tijuana is easily viewable
  lmao just go to san diego youll get the same experience just with less stevens
  i appreciate the effort senpaibut i would rather adopt another myroid i wouldnt feel comfortable having a negative stereotype of my own country     also sanheis damage was cute because it was made by mistake a myroid that was damaged against its will doesnt appeal to me       hey rude
really hard when your mistress is dead
  i mean ive been to the border at san diego if you meant san diego itself its nice vagabonds are an issue in any large city      ah yeah i see i was trolling you a bit with her story but can be an example of turning what you like into an oc if you do like those drinks then you could keep her design theme and ditch the troll profile or use other characters food folklore etc that you love for a base you kinda already do that the difference is yours are still pretty much the characters theyre meant to be    cute      i love making random girls so you can add a couple more if you want
  the back hair is a combo of 2 hairs therefore impossible ingame but im sure theres better wigs or hair in mcc by now
  not that im a lazy fuck but everyone can edit it       the thing with myroids is that i cant make a parody as with my other girls so i must copy them exactly or it will feel like im being disrespectful     dont worry though i already promised patch that i will adopt tsu when he dies
  youre retarded its disrespectful to steal the character in the first place more so when youve already been refused you stupid fuck
  im sure theres better wigs or hair in mcc by now  everything is the same as it was a year ago
  disrespectful for the myroids concept i dont mind being disrespectful to fellow anons
and people say dgers are assholes
  everyone can edit it  oh good if i find the others i made ill add em in the future    wasnt tsu a big tits girl or was she dressed in any body type i cant remember      i know theres been at least a couple of new faces and hair within the year theyre just not added to the mcc wiki
  yes and no patch has an adult and a loli version of his girls this is tsus loli version
oh man is this the long awaited colors final clearance sale i call dibbs on ichiko maybe even ninon too we are going to have so much fun
  what happened to her neck
  black market deep throat mod
  someone finally used that awkward lingerie kitbash i made
  when did you make it
why do i want to full rec them
  because youre an mccfag
  ok lets do this    shes shooting promotional videos to show the appeal of the makai world  this time its with one of the cool sunglasseswearing alpaca from the mysterious plateau
posting some recs i received in the rec event that just ended in sg
front
back
done
                    didnt know that this game can be so lewd
   is an edit from moe can change and the others are from soul girl
  dunno couple years ago          i kinda like these 3 bodies because theyre the closet ive seen to thicc in sg posts when everything else is skinny with magical pushed up tits shame the artists never improved
                              muh
  braaap
  onee pls
amb
custom cast had a small update reverse trap edition   new bangs were added as well as some new backgrounds
hello my fellow 4channelers dont forget to make something this weekend for the current contest details 
did you guys go on strike or something    this winner is   a comfy/professional video turned into chaos by adding the animals tilted glasses and horrified face accessory love it      a very cute scene love the hat and dress i guess a buddy is recording her though shes holding her own camera thats the only debatable avatar choice preventing it from winning id say      i love seeing a unique outfit and im convinced going to that world is superior to earth however despite the creativity its appearance could be confused for being a music video or random coord but im glad someone tried out making a sg entry id love to see more
  there wasnt a green card at stake so i didnt care that much
  ive been busy with having an actual job
  thanks i tried shame we only had three entries hopefully well get more    the theme i chose was delinquents/criminals your boys and girls all have a dark side to them show me their bad side are they gonna vandalize a building or mug someone in a dark alleyway your choice but id like to see what they turn out to be
  theres always a green card available as long as theres 7 participants      i bet everyone here has a job or goes to college try to squeeze in 10 minutes to make an entry or share other screencaps
  as long as theres 7 participants  sounds like id need at least 6 more entries
  im too lazy to come up with something clever so i just went with a yakuza look        nice filename weeb        why dont you enter 3
  who i dont know dgs
  sounds like your job is having you
  mint is no stranger to a life of petty crime
you guys better enter they just released a bad girl gacha on mcc
love seeing gacha salt and bitches just missing out on event rewards
  ill enter if you tell me who    is
i thought it was implied we already were in japan in the game given everything in the other events
  im rai on dg im a who to you guys though ill post my id later
angels or demons which ones are better
  both great as long as theyre lewd
  i want to do really bad things to that angel
hoshikare will be slowpoking on their christmas event i think      add yourself to the dg spreadsheet and tlr the list     by the way no one ever added columns for 5th and 6th girls someone please do so i cant either because of my browser of the doc has limited permissions
  why are mouth mole girls so kissable
custom cast updated they added new poses and hair parts also a background  i made a pastel girl because i finally learned about coloring outlines/shines in game
bad girl gacha just released   already posted a subpar entry  fug
  you can cancel the previous one and post a new one i grant you permission
  no one knows your girls anyway so you can post again and get away with it
i love this events mr outfit combined with the background its even better than the ranking prizes for me just perfect for my vampire girl that parasol sure comes in handy
did they lower the drop rates for stuff in the dg event gacha i dont remember it being 19 for the mr and my rank has barely moved since midway
post the cringy makeup things you have found
  its just her chin contour thats bad   just a nitpick desu
    do you even know how to use your eyes  
  shes going for a more natural look her blush/contour on her cheeks is cute and gives it a rosy feel but the way she carries on and contours her whole chin and then connects it to the cheeks is awful if i do say so myself    all she has to do is calm down the contouring and she looks good just my 2 pence
  that eyeliner tho
  i just realised the liner she just needs more practice     imo she would have looked cute if she only lined the upper eye and dos a softer line for her undereye
  i agree the eyeliner is bad but it looks like the same mistake everyone makes but most importantly how is this jfashion or lolita related
  bad makeup threads have always been a thing newfag
  again she just looks inexperienced its not mindsearingly horrible with a little bit of practice shed look fine her hair to accessory ratio is the most off thing in this photo
      sorry you got posted
i cant believe were honestly to the point of babying on /cgl/ that blatantly terrible makeup gets defended i want to go back in time what the hell happened
  no anon sorry you got posted
  lolitas happened
  posting your mediocre vandetta instead of the furry wannabe disaster in the backgroud  ive seen worse post some actual bad makeup
  no lolitas have been on this board for a very very long time and desu as far as being harsh with critique they are a lot harder on people than the cosplay side of this board lurk more newfag
  you sorry posted got
i hate newfags
  they have been in the scene for while years a think i can recall nothing new hereeeee
    yeah but usually the bad makeup thread is reserved for bad cosplay makeup or bad jfash you lurk more newfag
  newfag
  i feel like this could be a reaction image
  shes been cosplaying and wearing lolita for years her handmade is beautiful
  holy shit this picture is so old
  oh look its another bully    not only i there nothing remarkable about this girl or the photos if you really cared about fixing her makeup youd give her advice and let this shit go not try to shame her here
  wannabe disaster in the backgroud  its called not giving a shit while carrying out formalities in the office
  sounds like a struck a nerve  i would implore you not to attempt to defend yourself here no good will come of it
    wait so did the furry post the picture here
  ha everyone knows lolitas are salty bitches
  how is  defensive
        this thread should have been reported already the op pic isnt cosplay nor jfash the makeup needs work but isnt super cringey and obvious vendetta is obvious  trying to prove her make up is bad by posting a better picture moron
    jesus christ she looks like someone cut off her eyelids and i know this is a bad makeup thread but its not just her makeup that is bad
  welcome to 4chan mate this is all it is
  mmk why you lurking then
  care to show the class
  oof is taht even human
  i can recognize that uncut unstyled arda wig from a mile away it never looks good
  crusty gurl that makeup does not do you very well
daily makeup
tfw shes searching for her 6th sugar daddy
  saw this just a bit ago about this chick
  meitu game stronk
  yeah she friended me but then unfriended me and tried to friend me again apparently she adds a bunch of people from all over the world since im not even in the same country as her
  shame i really like this concept
cant decide whether this is bad makeup or bad photoshop its a shame because i usually like her cosplays
  both
  that motherfucking frankie munoz forehead
  she raises her eyebrows in every selfie to look for anime
  i feel bad cause her makeup fits her face in person the foundation could be a little less caked on but her photoshop/meituing is so strong and tacky
    thought this was voldie at first because of the 6head
  its more photoshop than makeup
  lolitas  not the most sadistic nitpicking fucks on this board since at least 2008
  nostrils we dont need no nostrils
  she looks like orlando brown
  shes cute
  everything is so shooped how can you even tell
  if she didnt shop her lips to hell she could get away with looking somewhat normal
found this gem while browsing cosplay on insta     not sure if wearing makeup but they lookin greasy af
  funny but perfectly decent cosplay
  reread the thread title senpai
  thats gross
  looks like the mom on american dad
  that crotch spot  ew
  if you do you make up like this you should never take a photo bending your head like this it will make it more noticible you are working under your waterline
  i think i actually found the first 4chan board that has more women browsing them men   what the fuck am i even doing here im not even interested in cosplay
  then you realize theyre just as meanspirited as the men on here
  if not more so women actually know how to get under your skin guys just call you a faggot and think its lel epic owned
  i fucked your mom last night lol
  unless shes in the makeup scene thats irrelevant
  no one on this board has ever gotten under my skin im an anon id you feel bad about what people on here say to you youre a pussy ass bitch
  i rest my case crossboarder
  i little costumey but hey its a cosplay board i dont think this belongs in this thread
    agree this is actually pretty cool the edges of the black could be a little cleaner but nothing a little photoshop cant fix
  ew and the feminist mouth on top of the shitty makeup
  oh god i know her she really does think that looks good too
  i think you meant to post this in the bad photoshop thread the makeup looks fine but that photoshop is bad
this thing keeps popping up on my fb feed and it honestly frightens me every time
  it claims to be gyaru
  ah yeah in sekai no gyaru sa group its horrific and no one has really said anything maybe because her english is poor
    guys   look at the left side closer   lol my god
  i cant see anything what am i looking for
character is huge bara man with a manly blocky head   give him smallmight sunken cheeks and acrylic paint lookin beard  crossplayer girls always do this gross lifeless contouring the rest of the costume is a wreck too girls should never try to be bara men we have enough of a hard time trying to look like regular men like sorry but it just isnt possible
the lack of body paint under the necklace  dr seuss mouth  eyebrows
  you seem to lack the basic skills of causal reasoning so ill help you with that its hot and the necklace  sweat made the body paint melt/fade off cant see any issue with her mouth and eyebrows so you probably have some sight deficit on top of the brain one sorry anon
  lmao not the anon youre replying to but this makeup looks absolutely awful if the necklace and sweat made the body paint melt off that means its not sealed properly the mouth also looks awful its like the cosplayer just drew a single line with a marker and called it a day also it doesnt have anything to do with makeup but that necklace looks like a cardboard cutout with some lines drawn onto it   the girl in the picture doesnt happen to be you now does it
  that characters pout is literally a single line lol most cosplayers ive seen never even bothered trying to recreate it and btw can you even read i wrote her heck i have the fucking balls to stand up for myself when someone offends me i just happen to follow this girl on fb and like her stuff but yeah its easier to think im just that offended girl instead of oops i cant even recognise an okay cosplay when i see one lol btw not sure where anon took the pics from bc i think theyre old she recently posted a new version of the necklace
  um excuse you she is an aspiring plus size model
  whiteknighting this hard
  you either seem awfully new or obviously defending yourself on here probably both if you cant see how your comments make it seem like youre defending yourself you should reread them  i know the character and ive definitely seen worse cosplays of her than this however the bodypaint and makeup just plain looks like trash to me its fading and doesnt work for what shes trying to achieve  nobody here is insulting this girl hard enough to warrant this level of butthurt
  feminist  i dont see it
dumping a ton ive found casually browsing instagram    theres an untapped goldmine from ips where fans tend to be younger eg homestuck voltron
    this one is a personal favorite of mine
  dont go around looking for kids to post creeper and a lot of these are just basic not that bad
  its just a meme
i thought the bad galaxy makeup trend was over
  it looks like a unicorn jizzed on her face why tf would anyone want this
    it looks good on anime characters in art that have proportions nowhere near a real human beings so it must look good on me
  not that anon and to each their own but it looks pretty bad here too noots more like a smurf got a nosejob and has a bunch of bruising and shit
  oh no i totally agree the colors of space and galaxies arent compatible with human skin tones in the slightest but that wont stop people from trying
  willing to bet that no one in this group is over age 16  dont post kids anon
  i think that the contrast might be too strong given how pale human skin is compared to blue and violet but if you do it with just a little makeup instead of a lot ie how they did their clavicles neck and shoulders it looks absolutely amazing to me and not liking something doesnt mean its objectively bad looking or badly done but who am i thinking 4chan meanies can understand that
  meanies  lol leave nayrt but that makeup isnt badly done but it is bad looking like bruises at least go blue if you must look like a trend faggot
  that makeup isnt badly done but it is bad looking    thanks proved my point
  something can be well done and look bad theres a thing called color theory there is something else known as overanimated and someone can make a bad decision at the start like fabric choice or material and work with it well but have it still end up looking bad in the end because of the very fact its purple and not blue or its shiny and not matte youre retarded
  i think it could look good in fullcoverage i dont think ive ever seen someone do white base with it though its odd because if youre putting on that much anyways you might as well start with a white base layer allover
gyaru is back with more nightmare fuel
  does she know what fake eyelashes are
  this looks like james letos joker when minimized
            am i missing something what exactly is bad about these they look fine
  damaged
  human  you mean white people  has anyone with dark skin tried it it might actually work if your skin is dark enough to make it look glowing
  well white skin is still human skin but i get what you mean
  she made zero attempts to cover her natural eyebrowsunless shes using her eyebrows as a double lid line
  yeah that mina and what i think is boosette look great wtf
the bad galaxy plague continues
  you think she meant to draw a dick on her face
my gift to you on this fine day /cgl/ the worst make up video me and my friends have ever seen gaze upon the visage of an alien made of liquid latex and fucking quinoa    
  this bitch looks so confused like shes never seen a makeup brush in her life
  looks like nick valentine caught syphilis
  cool concept bad execution
  this just looks like basic normie makeup nothing pukeworthy
  the image quality is so shitty how can any of you even tell if its good or bad
  thats a doll
  its still god awful
    youre both right
  i dont even collect bjds and this makes me irrationally angry with how much a doll costs and then to fucking massacre it with such a disgusting face up unforgivable c
  iis that supposed to be endeavor
  her face says meitu her eyes say then perish
  fuck its all bad the glue in that wig and it looks like there is more glue around the eyes the super shitty faceup its so muddy and the ear looks like its already chipping i kind of hope thats a recast because then it means someone didnt spend several hundreds of dollars to scribble on that poor doll
  jeez a better shaped wig would have made her head proportioned better actual hand lain prosthetic hair would have made her chin pop the contouring is too sharp but youre right in that theres only so much you can do with that but you can trick the eye with proportions if you dont mess up the wig i do bara guy costumes and i am not kidding myself that i look anything like them but i try to play with these visual tricks to my advantage what i want is better contouring tips to not look like a magazine model bishounen just manly im kind of winging it based on pictures at the moment
    is this the same person
why the lips 
  looks like she has been sucking on a exhaust pipe
  just getting ready to ride into valhalla all shiny and chrome
no thats a girl named snowmerida followed her then discovered she was crazy/her face started to bother me for some reason
  sucking demon cock
  this is a bad makeup thread this person is just making a creepy face anon doesnt look like they even have that much makeup on
  nayrt but i think your last statement is the point along with something about it feeling uncanny valley
  nothing about this hits the marks of uncanny valley girl is just making an unfortunate facial expression probably looks fine normally
  so crusty
  tumblr art in real life
  lizard people are out there senpai
posted in one of those post your most recent selfie threads with no other context i hope its a joke but you never know
  this is one of the worst things ive ever seen
  lmao that fucking eyeliner
  it look like she did the whole thing with a sharpie
  do it to em
  just realized that its bill cipher from gravity falls
    nah she always looks like that its her default expression
  i shutter to think how much this doll cost and now its worth 20
  post malone is that you
wonky liner  highlight makes their nose look bigger  faux freckles    to top it their instas a literal millie graves ripoff
itt wannabe muas posting mediocre makeup     we want some bad shit not something ok
  shes cute
  into the woods stage makeup perhaps
fresh from my local con
  he
    goddamn i saw a sanzo thumbnail and didnt check which thread this was totally not prepared for that eyemake and will have nightmares tonight
are there any examples of bad hollywood makeup
  holy fuck this is an undiscovered gem
  that is a spot on xelloss she doesnt really look like him but i think other than that she did a great job
  the costume is fine thats what this lady is good at along with her wigwork her makeup is absolutely her weakest point however
  lmao were assholes have you seen the ita threads
    i legit almost choked on my spit
  holy fuck why would you make your eyebrows permanently in a stupid expression like that
  its clearly makeup    also i really like that one mikan is my favourite dr character and im very critical of cosplays of her for example the wig is shit and shirt colour is off but the makeup looks great
  not as bad as it could have been its just mediocre post more horrendous shit
i know its supposed to be messy but this messy
  not much of a surprise considering the number of female users in this board
  i could park my car on her forehead
  dirty fucking fujoshits ruining shit       ຈ ᆺ ຈ cant tell real from drawn on eyebrows hombre      i honestly am not sure how nasty this looks in person since it has so many filters/edits on it it at least seems like it has neat edges in places like around the eye its possible this person is capable and simply has bad taste
  its drawn on and thats her expression in game looks dumb irl but accurate
      thanks to you three for telling me it was drawn on in a makeup thread i would have never guessed  when i say permanent i mean that your face is going to be making a stupid expression like that as long as they are drawn that way not like permanent makeup
  but thats literally the character
  my lips naturally fall apart when relaxed and im always so scared of someone telling me i look like freaking big red
        this is horrible but yall know the face up is removable right
    doesnt look like theyre wearing make up at all
  i have seen much much worse
  jesus fuck moisturize your lips first
im scared
  
  i feel like its more of a bad shoop than bad makeup
  i always thought this was a mouthbreather thing and not related to feminism at all
what were cosplay events like between 2004 and 2008
    ax 2006 cosplay contest photos i just happened to be browsing this site last week seeking lost pics from some of my first cons    contests had a lot and i mean a lot more skits not everyone had a costume performance was a much bigger aspect of it i kinda really miss it a lot
  this is a great example of how much cosplay has improved in just the last decade this is the biggest anime convention in the us and ive seen stuff this year at my local cons that would blow this stuff out of the water
they were magical     cosplay like this board peaked in 07
  it was magical  imo the biggest game changer was no smartphones without everyone holding a camera 24/7 there was more space for con shenigans
  beautiful
a lot more friendly it wasnt a competition it was just about nerding out with people who shared your interests it was a lot less mainstream the costume quality wasnt nearly as good but no matter how good your costume was people would be happy to see you it was a purer time
con orgies lots and lots of con orgies
  this  cosplays were mostly shitty but as long as you recognized someone / they recognized you a few laughs and meaning convos were shared  talking together with other cosplayers on how you managed to put together that on your cosplay or where you found that piece was very fun
  sometimes i see moments like this and wish i could experience the not giving a fuck/its all about me meow attitude of otakus/weeaboos too bad i wouldnt do this shit in public nowdays let alone with my boyfriend involved no thankies from mcspankies
  perfect they were literally perfect
  it was way more relaxed and fun than how things are now thats for sure social media kinda ruined it for me
  example of a faggot sucking the fun out of a lighthearted situation
tell me about umbrella corp why are they always present
less dance skits more skit skits there were a lot of baaaad skits too but people would stick around for the skits at the very end because thats always where they put the good shit youd stick around because the one or two excellent ones would be absolutely worth it hilarious and because uploading to youtube was much less a thing and generally in terrible quality anyways you really did have to be there
i found another archive       2004 was the year akon finally moved to what was then called the adams mark hotel/convention center and just by the pictures you can see how much smaller it used to be
  oh and every single person wanted to have some witty sign it got so bad eventually that they banned them i think
  some peoples signs got too large it became a problem got hit in the face with a  sorry gals im yaoi sign  i can still feel it
i wonder what all these early 2000s cosplayers  congoers are doing nowadays
      i really want down the rabbit hole to make another video similar to his furry video on how far the cosplay community has come and what it was like in the beginning     
  i remember egoraptor commenting about how when his wife suzy was still a cosplayer he would hold her sign confused the hell out of me whats the point of holding a sign
  in my case still cosplaying and going to cons
these old photo galleries make me happy for some reason
  i remember sign culture quickly scribbling something dumb on a piece of cardboard or lined paper just so you have one good times
tfw no old trips to comment on old con culture    man this brings back all the hetalia shit that was insane at cons before more cancerous fandoms like homestuck got huge teen girls would bring flags to lay on the grass and pose with their yaoi paddles    it was definitely a purer time smartphones changed a lot with how people acted in public there was less of a reason to be reserved and untrusting because cons werent mainstream and most everyone was a fan of the same things you were its not remembering it i think i went to my first local con in 2005 im still mad i waited so long to start going looking back
death note
signs paddles and back when glomping wouldnt be considered assault
no thots around
    what cosplays were as big as first season aot in the early 2000s and prior
  inuyasha was huge
  yeah where are soni hanyan masa etc    what have you done with my trip/namefags anon    bring back to us
  some that were big in my area around 2005ish and a bit before    of course the big ones like inuyashi so many sit boys  cowboy bebop  ah my goddess  yugioh  hellsing  gravitation hell any yaoi show like loveless etc  eva of course  chobits was the frail pale girl cosplay  a lot of those shitty harem shows like tenchi  elfen lied i distinctly remember the first girl/woman i met at the con i went to was cosplaying lucy and was sad everyone was calling her a cute cat girl  oh god bleach i do remember that bleach was getting huge around that time but we didnt have the same resources we do now so most were shitty ichigos with no wig jeans and those huge duct tape swords and their chubby or lanky rukia gfs  fma but mostly just ed and roy not many armor builds around where i lived  princess tutu  a lot of good ones like x1999 noir witch hunter robin azumanga daioh nana etc then typical ones like air gear clannad ohshc  im not even getting into games because there are so many and jrpg specific cosplay was popular back then too    there were more but my memory is failing me i need to get out my old hard drive and see if i can dump some old con pics    one huge difference between then and now is that most of the cosplayers were actual fans of the series they cosplayed from so you had much much more variety you saw people cosplaying from super obscure or never localized series because they were a huge fan in the late 90s we would save shitty low quality cd rips and find local fans to trade anime with    im not saying that cosplayers now arent real fans but there werent as many people racing to cosplay that fotm character and a lot of people once you complimented their costume would gush on endlessly about how much fun they had making it and talk about a series with you      it was a different time but it was a good one
  i miss tripfag culture on /cgl/ i miss /cgl/ circa 20082012 honestly that was the best time i want to blame the new janitors for killing it but i think it was the change in the cosplay community overall that changed this place    tfw no more cosplay power hour threads
  do they all post somewhere else now
jesus this made me feel strange to realize i only just started going to cons in 07    they were full of annoying 12 year olds like me before the age of all dance cosplay skits everyone either ran around like naruto or someone from ouran high school host club
people seemed more genuine about their hobby before social media now its more about making money out of cosplay lewd and begging for money on the internet miss those days
  this so much  i honestly wonder how many of the patreon cosplay thots would be cosplaying at cons if it was just for fun and not making them money my guess is very few   it was so much easier to nerd out with people at cosplay gatherings because you knew they were fans of whatever they were cosplaying now you kind of wonder when you see someone in a popular costume because they might just be doing it for attention   it was also way more common for people to make their own costumes because taobao and aliexpress werent well known so you had ebay con dealers halls commissions or make it yourself aside from some very popular costumes inuyasha edward elric naruto etc you didnt see loads of people in the same mass produced costumes
does anyone have any old school cosplay they want to dump
  a lot of them are fb friends also twitter
  i have this friend who cosplays from anything and everything but seems to hate most of the characters shes not doing it for fame because she doesnt sell anything ignores half the people who contact her outside of close friends and it comes across as a social thing more than anything else but i dont understand why shes into it beyond the wearing of the costume its so weird i enjoy getting pics together but its very hard to nerd out together about anything when half the conversations become oh haha i just liked the design i actually hate this character and even though i get that it makes me sad    i guess my point is some people are in it for the designs and its hard to tell usually by talking to them youll quickly gather whether its for fame or something else
  i killed them all  youre welcome
my area had a ton of cosplayers into helsing trigun cowboy bebop jojos bizarre adventure black butler and the weebos that were annoying like homestuck or deadpool today was axis hetalia cosplayers
i was most active with the otaku community and cons during 20002006 then i dropped off the face of the earth a while the feelings of cosplay was very different back then it was really exciting to see someone dressed up as a character you knew but things were not as extravagant back then the masquerades were also heavily focused on comedy i just highly regret how bad my social anxiety was back then i was going to attempt one cosplay by having my friend sew a costume but her depression overcame her and i never got it touga from utena only had the red wig i really do regret not cosplaying back then as i think it would have helped me break out of my shell at a younger age instead of breaking out in my early 30s
    damn i miss sign culture they still exist here but not nearly as popular as pre2010
a lot of ffx2 cosplays   but really it was just a lot smaller more chill shitty wigs posting to cosplaylabs when you got home
  stop lying theres no sex at cons
  it was mostly a weird nerd hobby and most cosplayers were around high school age  most cosplay was either bought or sewn by their grandma  usually the last one since not everyone knew where to buy stuff on the internet  there were still cosplay trends like dozens of chiis haruhis or those akazuki coats but i feel like those trends lasted longer than cosplay trends do today    today cosplay is less frowned as weird nerd shit and has become more mainstream thanks to social media  people who failed to become famous have found a way to get fame in this niche hobby  it almost looks like everyone wants to become famous nowadays following cosplay trend such as bowsette which only lasts a few weeks  the quality of the costumes has improved there are several webshop dedicated to selling cosplay material people selling their stuff on etsy and sharig their knowledge but the community also has become more comptetitive    sometimes i wonder if cosplay has turned into this degredation of a fanbase image that gets posted a lot
  unbridled sensuality 鉛欧域
shit was cash before 2008 not to many fags gave a flying fuck about pc bullshit and too much skin was so much fun to hangout and chill with people
  i dont cosplay any more because i was honestly never that good but now im a staffer on the board of directors actually trying to build something awesome for a community thats been with me my entire adult life    and apparently im still rolling around cgl whenever i really need to procrastinate
going to cons used to be cheap as hell back then i remember going to dragoncon back in 04 and spending no more than 250 for the whole weekend with hotel and travel included now with hotel and travel included youre spending over 1500 to attend dragoncon    cons in general have gotten more expensive due to their rise in popularity combined with supply and demand of rooms and tickets
  not to mention you gotta pay for those marvel movie guests
  lmao 3
  i fucking hate myself for not buying an eternal pass back in 07 its high as hell now i would have to go til im 49 to justify that price
    it was the wild fucking west    cosplay was still new and being figured out stuff that was incredible at the time would be laughed at now it was more honest at the same time  people didnt have shop     people were way more wound up and way more chill glomping was way more rampant than now but you could also have two people in your lap and no one would give a shit     prices werent jacked to hell and back an expensive signature was like 25  30 bucks a whole weekend could be 40  50 depending on the con    fuck i miss those days
  proof that costhots are not a modern invention
  i used to fuck gulls in costumes all the time wtf you talking about
you mean there was a time when cosplay was not about amateur models and normies dressing up to get followers on instagram    wow you guys must be old
  what were cosplay events like between 2004 and 2008  they were phenomenal 2008 was the beginning of the downfall of cosplay and 2012 was the death knell of cosplay at least in the states early 2000s to around 2008 were essentially when cosplay was peaking in terms of quality
  20042008  massive cosplay contests recorded between 19391954 with a huge resurgence in popularity during the 70s and 80s   cosplay was still new and being figured out  lol wake up son
  social media kinda ruined it for me  social media kinda ruined it for everyone
  we had a thread about this a while back and it as locked down and deleted when proof started to emerge so lets just pretend that con orgies never happen        well i wouldnt say that sea at cons never happened or happens the majority of female cosplayers have boyfriends so of course they are getting railed out in their hotel rooms but random hookups with hot cosplayers unlikely and cosplay con orgies nonexistent
  degredation of a fanbase  well desu while i have seen and understand that chart with cosplay it was more of a sharp downward slide as opposed to a slight degradation cons have always been about separating money from the fans and fans used to attend cons for the merch panels masquerade gaming cosplay and most importantly community interaction     while booth babes were always a thing the moment that random normies saw an untapped market of horny nerds an army of fake geek costhots sprang up overnightand of course so did their paetreons instagrams websites and facebook profilesthe timing was obvious and that marked the death of the hobby as we knew it
    uh huh please show me the huge grand cosplays of those times it was fans with sewing machines making star trek and star wars costumes    2004  2008 was the natal phase of modern cosplay
  uh huh please show me the huge grand cosplays of those times  what is google image search
  hiscuits
  were browsing this board on occasion to see how things have changed with the next generation sometimes we dig out our old photo albums and look at our shitty 90s anime cosplay and laugh about how there was so much less pressure and it really was about just having fun we chat about the nights we used sit outside with a cold beer when the con was over and talk about the latest anime we got off kazaa id trade us vhs with people whod got region 2 ones and wed post them back when we were done    good times
the previous thread has been deleted by the mods due to a violation of /cgl/ rule 2 dont bring community vendettas onto this board singling out individual cosplayers for the purposes of trolling them will not be tolerated i kindly ask the offending parties to refrain from continuing in this new thread so we can all move on to other subjects an keep these threads going strong even after 25 years    previous thread   moshi moshi christmas fair has been announced 15 and 16 december ndsm werf in amsterdam and will take place simultaneously with the sushi festival amsterdam  fandom weekend posted a rant on their cancellation and is offering refunds to those who bought a ticket oddly enough they did not notify their guests about the cancellation  kyocon happened and lets try to keep it at just this    the five next major events  mgc experience october 20th amsterdam nh back from the dead its the mgc experience  tweakersnet gaming live november 9th  11th den bosch nb a gaming con with massive money prices for the cosplay competition  castlefest winter edition november 24th  25th lisse zh the winter edition of everyones favorite con that combines castles and fests  heroes dcc november 24th  25th utrecht ut the winter edition of heroes comic con  moshi moshi fair december 15th  16th amsterdam nh a special christmas edition of moshi moshi fair which takes place simultaneously with the sushi festival amsterdam  full list     links and advice  posts made in dutch are against sitewide rules and will be deleted  defending yourself on /cgl/ often only makes things worse its best to take things posted here lightly and move on  when you get tired of this shit youre probably getting to old  our site with a store list newcomers guide and more   our discord 
since were having a very major drought of decent anime convention for december through what april may june may acon save our soulsand do well in the new venue please dont fuck it up   its clearly time we all expand our borders a little and become weeb tourists what are some european cons from now till winter that might be worth a visit   ill start off with mcm london while it technically falls into the comic con category its as weeb friendly as those can possibly get
is it just me or is literally every younger cosplayer in the dutch coscomm obsessed with danganronpa when its not love live i have yet to see any cosplayers under the age of 20 in this community who arent obsessed with either
about guildgames it was in the previous thread before it was deleted it was basically a student organized con similar to kyocon but then focused more on gaming/cosplay their first edition was in beursgebouw eindhoven and looked pretty sad chielon the guy that organizes it is a student/recently grad that goes around and asks all cosplayers to come to his little meetup
  wasnt mcm london heavily overcrowded and has every hotel in the area charging absurdly high prices as people will still pay them anyway      the only thing i noticed is that the older i get the less i care for the main flavour of the year as well as the niche/sub flavours with a dedicated fanbase i say good on them that they found something to enjoy and obsess about especially as that something doesnt include idol groups and their shitty dance acts
  yes its honestly not worth it
  i heard a few things about raicon in glasgow although i dont remember of those things were good or bad their winter edition is coming up november 4rd anyhow which may be a bit last minute to get a cheap flight
  i went there last year and it really was just too crowded to walk and talk
    guild games is pretty sad on every level before they rescheduled the event which they did due to a lack of interest literally 75 of the website was still to be announced and this was mere weeks before the event was supposed to take place   i dont really get why theres people supporting the whole thing
what are some of your favourite photographers personally i really like the works of devonkeubenphotography en robinmorganphotography
  melle krauwels cosplay fotograaf
  i agree with robin hes a good photographer i like his editing but he seems to be a bit selective on who he shoots with i dont like devon though his work looks like he just randomly threw a bunch of filters over his photos hes always depressed as well so thats a big turnoff for me i actually like phillostar a lot although his work seems like a hitormiss as well velvet art is nice too imho my favourite is skyvision but im not sure if they really fall into the dutch community       this meme or them trying to be funny should really stop though
  actually melle agrees it was a nice inside joke at first but to him it kinda feels really forced at this point and he never asked for this meme to be started
  miradel and weimar both manage to deliver consistent quality shots aryan from hype creations has improved significantly these past it really shows he has been asking for feedback and took notes nathan has also grown and i do like how he keeps experimenten with new techniques aside from them i quite enjoy watching newcomers and watch them progress over time    i like robins main style and especially his attention to colour i do wish he would cut back on the amount of editing he does in peoples faces as it just screams photoshop    devons postediting tends to be rather bland often using the same preset for everything if he would just put in a bit more effort he could deliver more interesting photos that actually fits the source material in terms of tone a shame really also doesnt help hes known to being a bit flaky      i really cant get a hold of zerkon the few times we met he was rather closed and he just gives off a weird vibe to me i also find his pictures to be nothing too special could just be me tho
  i really like the franchise but i feel like the fandom is filled with annoying kids
my favourite cosplay event photographer is special edition
  i enjoy watching the newcomers as well the ones i think got potential are devon although hes not necessarily a newcomer photos by citrus dave cosplay photography baka pictures  crao but i heard some really sketchy stories about the guy     furthermost i really like miradel velvet and dazzles style too i think robins photos are sometimes a bit overedited especially with the effects  faces
  wasnt crao from belgium though
  yeah he is and ive heard more then some really sketchy stories about that guy hes also always depressed and on top of that he refers to some of his way younger models as his little girls or little sisters which makes me wanna puke in my mouth plus his pictures are run of the mill and messy so thats a no from me
  she doesnt really have a photography only page i think but moriartician from instagram theres something different about her which i like and she is so damn efficient i shot with her once and she actually gave me a time window and a deadline and everything felt really professional as opposed to everyone else complaining about backlog
  citrus is actually xiuemi and from what i heard she is good friends with robin pretty sure he sharing some tips to her i think her photos look pretty good already
  kai is a rather good photographer he is also rather fast most of the time
    shadowbullet photography is also pretty good sometimes i think with him it is a hit or miss he can improve for sure
  i think shadowbullet is on the same level als melle but i really dont think hes good he still got lots to learn
  talking about photographers did vincent lee completely disappear from the cosplay com
  from what ive heard hes doing more paid gigs outside of cosplay cant blame him seeing how little money there is in cosplay photography
  isnt citrus her bf
    well not really im still waiting on pictures from kai back at animecon its getting annoying to wait so long and when you ask him he doesnt reply
  well get in line because a lot more cosplayers are waiting for their pictures some are even waiting for at least a year
      im from burgerland so i assume the cosplay culture is quote a bit different there is there a usual expected turnaround time   budding photog here just trying to get an idea for how long is too long in getting cosplayers their pics back
  here for most of the cosplayers too long is like 34 months depends on the person though but i think thats the general avarage
  theyre photographing/editing together so theyre both citrus
  but then again isnt cosplay photographer for most people just a hobby its pretty expected you wont make tons of money on just a hobby thats why its a hobby lol
  alltime favourite is definitely miradel she has a vision and consistently makes cosplayers look great   i also like chastten hes easy going nice to work with weiman is technicaly good but his models can look really unflattering sometimes its hit or miss
  im still waiting for pics from animecon but im not too bothered about them
  is there a usual expected turnaround time  its important to know that dutch conventions prohibit photographers to charge any money for oncon pictures and shoots we see conventions more as a means for both photographers and cosplayers to get some practice in and to do some networking i like this as it keeps the entire community easily approachable but it also means ones job and personal life will rightfully so have priority over postprocessing and delivering any pictures    with that said usually people deliver between 2 to 12 weeks depending on how busy they are in life and the amount of postprocessing they do this can be anywhere between performing no postprocessing at all and going over each picture manually in lightroom and applying light to heavy touchups in photoshop some will also give priority to planned oncon shoots over the random people they shot which i can definitely understand it should also be said that the postcon depression can hit a person quite hard and kill their creativity and productivity    my advice if you want to give an indication on when you will deliver ones pictures try to find out how long you usually take on editing and check your schedule to see how much time youll actually have to do so after each convention as long as you arent being paid and havent been slacking off theres no shame in letting people wait a little longer on their pictures as long as you give them a headsup
  i heard he only sends the people he  likes  photos faster and doesnt care about what his models want
  who 
  kaleidoscopy
    with the part on charging money for shoots it really annoys me lately the cosplay scene is attracting more and more oldies who do basic paid studio photography with no clue about cosplay and keep ranting/starting the discussion about how weird it is there arent many who do a paid shoot/ask too little
    ive always had the view that if its at the con do it for free if you do a shoot at a studio outside a con at another location it can be paid even if its just travel allowance or something
    outside a con is fine if that is the deal you made with a photographer/cosplayer but i meant it more as alot of non cosplay photographers come check oit the scene which is cool suddenly come boasting and almost saying ftp basis offcon shoots are weird it should be paid etc which usually are the types with a basic headshot made in a studio as a profile picture its fine they want to shoot for money but dont shit on the ftp base people who actually enjoy it as a hobby
  that is indeed the main problem with those kind of photographers they dont seem too understand that most people whi do cosplay photography are not profesionals and do it mostely as just a hobby
  i really hate these normie studio photographers guys who are coming to perv on girls at cons they really have no clue what cosplay photography is really people should stick to photogs like miradel and robin instead of stepping into these creeps their studios it seems cons are attracting more and more of them lately
  thats because the costhots seem to multiply having no problem to strip their clothes of for some guy as long as he has a camera obviously that attracts creeps and perverts
people dont put robin morgan devon and citrus in with the other photographers their work is really not that good
  ur taste is a bit weird
  right get over your feelings
  neither is morgans honestly its 85 editing
  i was more disturbed by the comment that put dazzle in the same sentence as miradel and velvet art
  i think their work is pretty good to be honest i mean theyre just hobby photographers anyways sure theres room for improvement but theyre better than the average cosplay hobby photographer out there in the dutch scene
  i agree want to talk about bad one trick photographers then surely its dazzle
  so is anyones including mirade velvet etcwhat is your point
the netherlands is one of a handful of countries in which the coscom doesnt pay their photographers whether it be off con or at con that honestly kind of baffles me   can someone explain to me why it is expected that people drag their heavy equipment somewhere drive a long way ask a photographer who didnt plan on shooting you explicitly and still expect the pictures to look dazzling be edited in a jiffy and all for free   when a photographer asks for money or compensation it is considered taboo but in most other countries you need to book a slot with a photographer at a con    im not saying all of the cosplayers do this but i do notice it happening a lot in the netherlands  what are your thoughts   im not attacking anyone with this i just want more insight because to me this discussion about comparing photographers is interesting but i dont understand the lack in understanding for paid photoshoots  fyi i am comparing paid photoshoots with foreign cosplay specialized photographers who also charge their cosplayers not creepy basement studio guys in the netherlands
  photographers here shoot who they want to shoot theyll say no if the cosplay is not up to their standards or not their style that said theres some cosplayers that still have the guts to complain about that in fb groups while the photographers do it for free  most if not all cons forbid photographers from asking money for their services or prints of pictures made at a con  a handful of popular theres not a lot in the nl cosplay photographers make schedules with cosplayers they enjoy to make pictures with at cons ofcourse for free since the con forbids payment often enough these photoshoots offcon organized are paid for generally in the sense of travel costs or such but only if the cosplayer approaches the photographer  ive done a couple offcon shoots that were free i just had to take care of my own travel to the location since i was asked to be photographed  i guess photographers are more hobbyists in the netherlands also heavy thousanddollar costing equipment isnt that similar to heavy thousand dollar costing cosplays dragging those to a con
  my point is that theres always a certain lack of things decent posing challenging compositions general risque its all just pretty looking fluff
just came back from mgc tomotickets on their bracelets as well and almost nothing to do there few shops decent artist alley but other than that meh such a disappointment
  dont tell me you expected anything else
you are aware miradel is gonna stop cos photographing for a little while right she wants to focus on irl stuffs
as a cosplayer with not so interesting costumes who does want some pictures of them what is a decent price to pay for shoots
  that usually depends on the photographer and even then theres a lot of factors that go into coming to a price  the time put in hours paid travel expenses location costs food etc   or perhaps theres a set price a photographer has for the sort of shoot you wanna do     what i would recommend though is figure out what cons you wanna go to and just ask a cosplay photographer if they are going to the con and if they might wanna take some pictures with you if you dont know where to start look at the photographers named in this thread a good bunch wouldnt charge money at conventions even if they were allowed to take a look at their style and just send them a message
  just speak up to photographers at cons where its free you can start networking here
  yea it wasnt anything to write home about dealer room was dark artist alley with a few dealers was brightly lit  some of the well known bootleg dealers were there although one of them seemed to have less this time but they did carry stuff that made me think that kaomiji was there instead saw that guy from animecon argue with the weebs from the bootleg plush dealer wanted to got to them to tell him its not worth it but he shut them down before i got there  catering wasnt much and dangerous saw the food stand next to honkies touch food without gloves so glad i managed to get a sandwich in    if this is the new and improved mgc never mind then
  i am yes not everyone does know that i think but yeah sadly no miradel pictures for a while
is it me or are wicketwigs products pretty bad for the price  i was happy to have a cosplayfocused wig shop here but im not spending 90 on the fakest looking lacefronts ever
  its you
  i can recommend a few german conventions    bookfair leipzig march  dokomi dusseldorf may/june  animuc munich april
    to be fair i so dislike their online webshop it looks so bland like their models dont even want to try on the wigs for a photo to sell the product i like them more when i see them on a convention because i can see them up close although i cant speak of kwality of their wigs i only bought my front lace wigs online from posewigs and wigisfashion
  connichi was always a good event
  its not just you when i started cosplaying i bought wigs for way too much there now i know how to find better wigs for half the price on aliexpress they might be good for starter wigs but there are better alternatives
  other anon you see them a lot at conventions and im not convinced of their quality either many of their wigs are thin or poorly structured i dont find it worth the money
im here to start another topic    i heard that europe and especially the dutchies are quite closed for fat cosplayers theyre often mocked and looked down at    what is your point of view of fat and chubby cosplayers do you feel like their quality in cosplay is often less than the skinnier ones or do you welcome them cosplay is for everyone and all that
  to put it simple most of the dutch coscom dont really mock fatter cosplayers out in public youd be immediately called out for being toxic and bodyshaming  though i am quite sure that in almost any friendcircles in the com they bodyshame or talk shit about other cosplayers outside of their circle  that or they post it anonymously or on private/hidden accounts on social media chats  in other words you wont be hearing it in public or in your face but a lot of people not all do bodyshame others  its up to you to decide if this is asshole behaviour for slandering about others or not because youre trying to act nice to them despite your opinion on their cosplay
  cosplay according to your bodytype cosplay is about portraying a character if you dont even look like it it ruins the experience it doesnt have to be 100 accurate a little bit of difference is fine but some fatass cosplaying a twink character is just lame this goes both ways though skinny dyels who cosplay as buff dudes are just as pathetic looking or like guys who refuse to shave their beards for their cosplay there are so many characters in all forms of media that you could find plenty to cosplay as
  i personally am on the cosplay is for everyone team but i do agree with   about people gossipping behind peoples backs or here on 4chan which is a shame if youre going to be a bitch be the whole bitch do it in public in stead of hiding behind some anonymous internet profile
  before explaining anything its important to know two basic things about the dutch mindset first off due to our calvinistic roots we are strong believers of just be normal thats wild enough stand out or boast too much and the crowd will cut you down and put you back in your place as the equal that you are secondly we have this thing called dutch tolerance which boils down to everyone being free to whatever they want as long as they arent being a nuisance to others because of this the dutch are very selfaware and expect others to be so as well    what this means for cosplay is that we simply expect one to dress accordingly to their body if youre fat and out of shape you just know it would look weird for you to cosplay as wonder woman a fit athletic heroine got manboobs better keep your shirt on if you want to remotely look like goku and not like fat buu    with that said we do differentiate between those who cosplay for fun and those who cosplay more seriously we have low standards for those who cosplay for fun and such are mostly left alone under the motto cosplay is for everyone we may be dutch but were not barbarians
  t h i s
the dutch coscom has more fat than skinny cosplayers imo and theyre all in each others asses
  i would say cosplay is for everyone but the truth is and thats not only in our small country but everywhere if you want to get recognized as a cosplayer and get a name out there lose some damn weight if youre chubby or fat    same goes for competition cosplay people are more likely to remember a thin person that looked well in a cosplay than a fat person that does have skill but didnt look too good i for one dont like looking at fat rolls but thats just my preference    and thats just the bitter truth
   if youre going to be a bitch be the whole bitch do it in public in stead of hiding behind some anonymous internet profile  please do get yourselves banned from the few remaining decent dutch cons asap it happened before and it can happen again if youre a closeted judgemental ass dont stay on 4chan spread that toxicity far and wide make sure the whole community has an opinion about you in that 2 weeks of relevancy slot before youre entirely forgotten afterwards     there are a few too many circle jerk hate groups out there be it discords or private whatsapp groups where all these toxic opinions hide even 4chan is so mild these days i cant stand that there are so many people who have a down to earth chilkind outwards appearance on cons and shit talk people into the ground in their personal little hate chats then again the people they shit talk in turn have their own hate groups where they shit talk the other party in the exact same way  the best part about these groups is when someone in one of those groups accidentality outs themselves or one of their friends and seeing everyone act like they never knew that person in 02 seconds cant let it be known youre friends with someone toxic after all and youre of course nothing like that toxic friend    honestly the current cosplay community its fakeness and dishonestly is a crumbling facade we all have opinions be it extreme or not be it expressedpositively or negatively or not
    id like to add that being chubby or fat is also incredibly unhealthy and these cosplayers need to lose weight for their own well being anyway even when society nowadays make it look like being chubby and fat is perfectly normal so why not make cosplay your motivation to do so
    i agree with this post along the general lines but it also a bit in my opinion about what the reason that someone cosplays besides liking design or series do you cosplay for yourself or for others and/or their attention most likely i have a feeling most fat cosplayers that complain about skinny or skin showing cosplayers being populair is that they want that attention and/or deserve it more just because they are fat/had a hard bullied life/skinny people have it easier and thus ruining the their chance to get attention they want that is why they crawl in each other ass
i feel like there arent many fit cosplayers most good looking ones are skinnyfat like in america there are many plus sized cosplayers also ones that make great costumes but also fit ones that buy everything or have slaves make the costumes for them
  please do get yourselves banned from the few remaining decent dutch cons asap  except dutch conventions dont ban people just for being mean or because of some rumours it takes a lot more to get banned from a con threats theft assault harassment drug trade or pretty much anything that violates convention rules or dutch law being mean on the internet not so much
   if youre going to be a bitch be the whole bitch do it in public in stead of hiding behind some anonymous internet profile   do it in public in stead of hiding behind some anonymous internet profile   do it in public  did you read were not talking rumours here babe get out there go big and expose yourself mid convention there is no bad publicity if you just want attention get people talking making opinions about you they may forget you in a few weeks but youll have your name stapled as someone everyone in the community has an opinion about
  im not saying you are barbarians but dutch people do tend to have a more straightforward opinion on topics like this one     that aside im curious to when you view someone as a cosplayer that is cosplaying more seriously and what you consider a cosplayer just cosplaying for fun     and what if a cosplayer that is just cosplaying for fun becomes popular but happens to be fat do you expect them to lose a little weight
  did you read all i pointed out was how conventions dont just ban people over silly vendettas and people being mean to eachother im getting the feeling youre assuming im a specific someone so allow me to make it clear im likely not who you assume i am i guess it comes with the territory of posting as anonymous
  people seriously need to stop assuming who made certain posts you can never be sure whoever wrote what post i though that was clear when everyone pretended to be propanon
  nah babe i have no clue who you are and couldnt care less about your identity   i read yes but you took a specific part of what i said and acted like there was nothing behind that sentence this wasnt just about getting yourself banned from cons for whatever reason its all about exposing your sinning self for the world to see drop the facade lets all hate one another on main no more faked friendships and talking about one another behind each others back  or as the comment i originally quoted put it   if youre going to be a bitch be the whole bitch do it in public in stead of hiding behind some anonymous internet profile
  im not saying you are barbarians but dutch people do tend to have a more straightforward opinion on topics like this one   oh that was just a joke on my behalf dont read too much into it its just that some see our straight forwardness as rude    that aside im curious to when you view someone as a cosplayer that is cosplaying more seriously and what you consider a cosplayer just cosplaying for fun   attitude mostly i notice serious cosplayers are often more focused on making a name for themselves by competing in larger competitions hosting workshops or panels trying to get invited as guests or judges looking for sponsors and what not you rarely see someone who only cosplays for fun doing these kind of things    and what if a cosplayer that is just cosplaying for fun becomes popular but happens to be fat do you expect them to lose a little weight  not really but id still expect them to dress accordingly to their bodies making a good costume and putting it on is one thing but pulling off a convincing cosplay is an entirely different thing it requires one to match their looks and shape as closely as possible to the original character to sell the illusion of actually being them of course this doesnt has to be all natural and things like shape wear makeup corsets can definitely assist them with this but to me its one of the key elements what makes or breaks a good cosplay unfortunately not everyone agrees with this and use the cosplay is for everyone trend as an excuse not having to put in a bit more effort its a shame really especially as it mostly holds them back in the end
  i think you meant smokeanon because i have an actual tripcode
  youre annoying in trying to be such a sanctimonious dogooder and trying so hard to expose someone just leave it be  is most likely not going to be who you want it to be or respond the way you want them to i dont even know what youre trying but quit the sanctimonious act and condescending use of babe   thank you
  gee dont get so offended deariebetter than babe right im not trying to expose anyone in specific at all never said i had any dirt on anyone and lemme slip you in on this little fact i dont have anyone or anything to expose im just vouching for the idea of if and when youd be a bitch be a full on bitch dont go halfway go the full way this community could use some good ol purging  i dont want just anyone in specific to show their true bitchin self everyone should chaotic freedom lets burn all these double standard to the ground    though gosh its a little concerning how personal you and the other anon are taking my random anonymous comments here its almost like youre feeling personally attacked how wild its as if by taking me so seriously youre kind of suggesting youre someone who talks a lot behind people their backs whoa funny how that works feel de devil breathin down your neck yet
  nah senpai im just tired of people like you who think theyre preaching to the people and think theyre so important i agree with you on the point of being open and straightforward but thats not gonna happen because people are people deal with it
  i dont see myself being very important in this at all im just a nobody really i may hope that if people want to truly peach to this community they dont do it in a place like 4chan  its ok if people are not feeling up to it right now one day the community will crumble and fall in on itself because of it though at least the next generation of tiny weebs can replace us like weve replaced the 1st wave congoers before us
    good posts
1 dutch people are taller and less fat than the average american in the cosplay scene that is not different therefore being fat stands out a bit more  2 dutch are more direct so when you put on a costume and your friend tells you it would look better is you would lose a few kilos we rarely use pounds it can be honest fair and kindhearted advise    personally i think your body is part of your costume if you can spend half a year on a costume you can also lose 5 kilos easily to make the total picture even better   is your size a reason to not cosplay something no however expect more praise if you look completely like the character instead of 1/ half the picture
people hate being told they can lose weight because it means that you confront them for being lazy   even bucktooth sandbag lvante lost weight for cosplay and you all know it did her good     thing is eating healthy by cutting down sweets and snacks and just switching to water instead of soda eating 5 small meals instead of 3 big ones  snacks and at least 30 mins a day of excersize is something they all dont want to deal with it means changing myself for society lol    losing weight is the easier part of being a good cosplayer unless you have a medical condition     actually learning how to sew and make props and some basic wig styling takes more time and effort than doing 50 situps and squats every day
     losing weight is the easier part of being a good cosplayer unless you have a medical condition     even if you have a real medical condition people still call you fat and lazy cause only lazy fat people say they have a medical condition that makes them unable to loose weight    it doesnt matter what you do if youre fat/skinny fat/not even fat you can never win from that facking 4chan fat hivemind
  but most fat people i know blame it on some kind of medical condition i have met very few that actually just admit their overeating and need to hit the gym more often i mean sure there are some very rare medical conditions that can cause you to be fat but according to fat people they do not seem to be so rare
 only rare medical conditions make you fat    and thats where you and many people are wrong    chemotherapy makes you fat  cancer is a very common disease    antidepressants make you fat  depression is a common illness    many things can make you fat but people just want to call fat people fat and lazy thus enabling some sort of stigma against fat people    people just need to stop judging you dont know why people are fat you have no reason to tell them to loose weight or to excise more just mind your own business
    are you high chemo patients are told to eat extra beforehand since they will lose weight because of the side effects like nausea loss of appetite and generally feeling really bad   antidepressants can increase the feeling of hunger therefore prompting people to eat more but you can definitely be on antidepressants and maintain or lose weight you simply need to track your intake  i dont care if you want to be fat but youre in denial about the causes the only cause is your overeating
  exactly its the same story that any average fat person gives you nowadays its always medical and you should just mind your own business     ive seen fat cosplayers at cons eating huge bags of potato chips pizzas and what not still claiming their fat because of some medical problem   yall just keep kidding yourself i wont be the one dealing with diabetes anyways
  either way they are still ugly and an eyesore it doesnt matter how they got to that point
  even the pill can make you fat depression on its often causes weight gain      chemo really on average makes you fatter it can happen due to fluid retention an increase in fatty tissue and steroids that are in chemo the nausea can also lead to carb cravings
          thanks for proving earlier statements    it doesnt matter what you do if youre fat/skinny fat/not even fat you can never win from that facking 4chan fat hivemind   even if you have a real medical condition people still call you fat and lazy cause only lazy fat people say they have a medical condition that makes them unable to loose weight      shadow and oessie stop sharing one fucking braincell you incels
  thinking this is a mentality only 4channers share  lmao  u
    fluid retention is not fat and does not make you fat carb cravings do not make you fat giving in to cravings does steriods can change where your fat is stored but cannot create fat out of thin air the whole logic is just wrong    nevertheless people on chemo are usually very sick and will have more important problems than how they look in a costume the average chub cosplayer will definitely not be on chemo the argument is fucking stupid   im not even mad about people being fat or not but this is just disrespectful to people battling cancer dont go throwing chemo around as an excuse seriously what is wrong with you
oh look its the cosplay is for everyone vs you look like shit if youre fat discussion again  my grain of salt if you wanna be taken seriously when you wanna look like the character have somewhat the same body shape too
can yall just stop pretending to be doctors and stfu    the only thing youre proving is that yall are narrow minded af    just mind your own fucking business and leave people be
throwing in chemo as an excuse for being fat is like the lowest of the low what is wrong with you people on chemo got some serious shit to deal with dont be using this as an excuse for you being obese seriously your that desperate to just not admit you might be simply eating too much
sure all the fatties are fat because they are depressed from their chemo
  better to be narrow minded than wide bodied amirite
it shows that /cgl/ is a mostly female board all these excuses for being fat instead of just owning up and seeing that youre fat because you shove your face full of food sure some medical shit can have an impact but thats nothing that a stricter diet and more exercise cant counter balance at least the fat men mostly know theyre fat admit it admit its cause they eat too much/exercise too little and dont make much excuses and then the women go oh my size 40/42 isnt even that fat and oh but i am totally active and healthy mind your own business fat chicks are just unattractive but rather than fixing their own shit they prefer to blame everybody and everything else and just force other people to tolerate and accept their flabby heaps and its bad enough in everyday life but in cosplay that just looks downright awful when theyre trying to accurately portray a character but then look like a sandbag wrapped in spandex
  while i agree 4chan has this strange hivemind that even anyone with a little bit of curves or cellulite is fat theres a difference between fat fat and obese   i work out a lot and gained quite some muscle in the past year but im not getting rid of my cellulite because thats just the way it is it doesnt matter that ive got a low bodyfat percentage to 4chan its still fat and i think thats part of the reason why people are just like this is my reason for being fat but i dont know
for fucks sake the topic was overweight cosplayers being looked down upon cant you people stay ontopic just once instead of turning this into a /fit/ discussion about what makes a person fat and how to lose weight
fandom weekend disaster is not over yet    visitors and standholders are not getting any money back since paylogic havent heard anything from the organization also this article was published on the 20th    
  im glad this part of the shit storm finally made a local newspaper article more exposure like this makes it harder for him to try and pull this crap again in the future especially as this article features his full name im sure every major dealer is aware of his sketchy business by now and will want to have nothing to do with him anymore    if anything it sickens me how he tried to keep the cancellation a secret from everyone never notified his celebrity guests about the cancellation and now is also refusing to pay back anyone hell he even slandered the location and its director for the cancellation despite him never having paid the deposit for location to begin with i really hope justice will be served for the sake of everyone affected by his actions
  it is on topic fatties be like you should mind your own business my body retains fluids some sort of shit others be like just stop shuffing your piehole full of shit this directly relates to fat cosplayers not willing to loose weight to portray a character more realistic
all of the you can reeeee all you want but truth is most people dont cosplay to please others so it isnt going to change anything   voorjekijkendoorlopen
     to comment to you    why do you think you have the right to tell someone something like that are you even sane in your right mind     no one has the right to bodyshame someone and yet you think you have this entitlement    maybe you should go to prison theres no way people can be fat in prison right sounds like the right place for you
  being this angry that fat people can be comfortable with their bodies  just because you arent comfortable with your own body doesnt mean you should try making other people uncomfortable with theirs  
its so stupid when people say they shame on fat people because they care about their health like you would actually care about some random peoples health lol are you also going to tell every random smoker in public to quit
      better a sjw than a fattie hating body shaming manchild shrug
  seeing how a third of taxes goes towards healthcare its not that weird that wanting a healthy society is desirable that combined with the fact that a rise of fat chicks significantly makes the dating pool of attractive chicks smaller plus a fit and healthy society is less likely to be lazy and more likely to be productive and innovative

  who hurt you
  oessie just stop posting and get back to the gym please
i hope this will get deleted again
when a curious question about how fat people are viewed in the dutch com turns into this    im truly sorry people i was actually having a good debate with
    if those cosplayers who arent cosplaying for others  thus their attention wanting a big cosplay social media account follows likes  complain so much the more skinnier/well curved get the attention  they arent all cosplayer for others so why are they complaining others dont care for them

  jikes please no     honestly dont think theres much left for them to gobble up though only small events may be tempted by their help i think the few remaining mediumlarge anime cons know to avoid any such offer and keep distance   theres only what four of those left by now though anime nishicon yaycon and abunai
  wait jaapcon is back
  sadly yes
  theres still plenty to swallow up at our southern neighbors
how i feel about some people on this thread    iframe width560 height315 src frameborder0 allowautoplay encryptedmedia allowfullscreen/iframe
  
  since when is drachten in the earthquake part of our country
  ttps//wwwyoutubecom/embed/raltofl9f2w  since  
  jesus christ baggerklaas such a shitty name didnt expect anything else from the people from drachten though
  it stands for   boeren anime gilde groningen en regio  their mascot is pretty fun though gotta see the humor of it
well i guess viencon 2019 is a thing guys
  going
  awesome that leaves me with little under a year to find a group of laidback mature trustworthy people to share a cottage with wish me luck
  im probably gonna skip next year i didnt like last time all too much i hoped theyd make it nonshared in 2019 but apparently they wont besides looking at most photos that were taken during last edition arent all that worth it for me either
  very glad to hear theyll get another edition to be honest with the right cottage mates it can be a lot of fun of course you shouldnt really do it for the con part but i personally loved the fact that you had one area filled with cosplayers and their cottages that really was spmething i didnt get to experience at other cons also because of that the parties are way better
  i know right it was supposed to be a photo con but yet i have not seen one single good photo from it all photos i saw really looked terrible and very amateur but as far as i can tell none of the really good photographers went there anyway
  its organized by photographers btw and what there were good ones there there were good ones from germany and england as well they are not in any dutch cosplay groups though some of the german and english cosplayers looked nice though
  too bad its shared but im still going dont care much about other peoples pictures
how does the pricing work for viencon do you buy a package per person or do you need to rent a cottage and buy a ticket seperately
  per person but it includes everything they said the price will be increased somewhat it was around 110115 euros last time so i guess its gonna be 130 or something including ticket pool pass etc oh wait except toiletpaper hahaha
  its cheap   hmm animecon or abunai is over 210 150170 for a hotel and 70 for tickets     but ofc for day visitors ur forced to stay entire weekend sucks for them  but sounds like a solid deal
  you need to fill a cottage though it starts at 4 even though its per person
whats the best place to buy japanese magazines in the netherlands especially if you want to subscribe to some
    i dont think anyone brought their agame in costumes or photographers as it wasnt sounding like much       didnt one person have to cough up the entire sum for atleast 4 first then you have to figure out the rest of the payments amongst your group
  i am thinking of the american book center if you want to buy an edition subscription i dont know
  i dont care about others people pictures but i sure do care about my own lol
 1/2  i dont agree entirely with  i feel this is only big city mindset here not dutch in general im from smaller towns and cities and here its cool to look or be different people are also direct youre weird youll be told so but its fine to be weird not necessarily an offence its no more than a notion sonetimes positive sometimes negative but often just simple something they noticed and dont care about     that being said you do you and dutch freedom goes many ways youre allowed to be weird and think someone is weird youre allowed to have negative opinions as well they are opinions and its up to you if you care or not generally people dont care also some people here will only give opinions when asked or between friends including opinions about strangers unless youre bothersome or they want to compliment because in the end why would their opinion even matter to a stranger so why tell you unless you ask others will give it no matter what and are extra direct compared to big cities because opinions shouldnt matter on such things and they are as free to have them as you are free to like weird stuff if youre offended its a simply dont be offended kinda mindset like youre the one caring for a strangers opinion after all    really its a big you do you on all places i lived i hate big cities because people are so busy with judging others and caring what others think i think smaller places are much more relaxed you can break laws here and as long as it bothers no one but yourself no one cares because its your life not theirs calling cops for something simple that bothers no one is considered much better ofcourse bother no one else is important here and friends who worry will still try to help each you ofc      nowreligious places are another story and often small but they tend to be very stricked on the norm
 2/2  that being said we all have opinions in the end they might not matter but just like everywhere youll be judged some might like it others hate it i personally like good cosplay but dress for the body you have indeed that one goes more ways as other anon said    also not most conventions are in bigger cities so you will see that behaviour the most with normie around cons but there are often enough people from smaller places around who will not think that way and cons always being there means you will run into them as well so just know both types exist here and both interact a bit different
  i meant to say most are in bigger cities so youll see that more might be more typos as im on phone in a hurry but that one seemed important to note
  all of these sound shit with dcc being a bit less shit
  hotels are always fucking expensive for abunai i just stay at a nearby campsite and it only costs me like 30 bucks for the whole weekend
  animecon still has early bird weekend tickets for sale just 57 euros    and in 2019 they will open on friday at 1200 and close on sunday at 2000 so thats just slightly more than a euro per hour    dcc will cost 25 euros per hour and that is if can get in at 10 and dont leave before 6
  except for its not a good alternative for the hotel if youre cosplaying and want to change inbetween of if youre not wearing the easiest costume its pretty shit ive tried alternative sleeping in the scouting building during animecon and that was just doable
  i dont see any japanese magazines there
  hmm have you asked at the counter if they can order it for you i thought they did offer it but i can be wrong of course things can change over time
how about air bnb it does offer cheap places to sleep
  airbnb is cheap but availability greatly varies per town for animecon it shouldnt be too hard to find something in rotterdam but for abunai in veldhoven there only were a couple of listings
  57 euro but no hotel viencon was 115 and thats including ticket and place to stay i live animecon and im going dont get me wrong and rdam is a better location for me than the hague but viencon has the better deal but i hear viencon is gonna be more expensive next year im gonna guess 130 euros still cheap though
  i think what was meant was total price stay and ticket whats the per hour thing
  this is indeed true what i think you should also take into consideration is the fact that you have to leave your cottage at monday morning at viencon meaning you get to spend sunday evening at the convention as well im not sure if the con part is open during sunday evening but i do remember the pool being open for cosplayers that evening
  they are both shit
    you can make your stay at conventions as expensive as you want fancy 5 star hotels cheap hostels sharing an airbnb or simply sleeping at home are all possible    but honestly its not a matter of value per hour but what people look for in a convention each convention offers a different experience that appeals to different people some want content some want to browse lots of dealer stands and others just want an excuse to spend their weekend getting drunk and dancing at deshima sounds to the last group viencon would be a better con than say abunai but to the first group this would be the reverse because of this there is no universal best con or bang for buck making this whole cost comparison a bit pointless
  not really one took a break after crying on instagram live while the other is still going strong imo care to elaborate
  feeling bad cuz your photos look shit devon indeed had a cry session on insta but robin is getting better by the day really loving his work
  werent zerkon and crao in the same kinda shit now that i think about it
  just because he isnt crying doesnt mean his photos are good
  what do you mean with the same kinda shit
  them being depressed that their pics arent good enough
  i think zerkon got depressed after reading here that his photos are shit
  please be joking theres no point in getting depressed over some random person on the internet not liking your work that is unless you made yourself believe youre hot shit and realised how hard youve been playing yourself
  viencon is getting more stuff in this time including a japanese matsuri dealers and more events
  viencon is getting more stuff in this time including a japanese matsuri dealers and more events  they better especially now that theyve got competent people handling the events
    for real though he keeps posting on his stories about his work not being good enough literally whenever he gets mentioned on here lately he uploaded a few new photos with his new editing techniques but to be fair i dont see a difference and its still the same ugly shit    devon on the other hand had a fullblown cry session on instagram about how his mom sold his camera and whatnot something about financial problems yet he keeps sitting on his ass with his low uitkering its so incredibly embarrassing
  lol i thought i was the only one not seeing any difference to me his new editing photos still look exactly the same
  i had spoken to zerkon over this he actually never saw his work as really good he sorta saw these posts as a wake up call to actually improve his work more it actaully made him really motivated to get better he still got a long way to go and he knows it well i mean honestly if you see his latstest posts you can see kinda an improving i guess
  you do i see no difference
  i literally see no difference in his improved techniques it still looks like the same shitty work to me im glad im not the only one lmao
  who isnt depressed with this cold fucking weather tho
  i could go back there and ask but they did not have a single japanese magazine there so i doubt that they would order 1 just for me
didnt there used to be a japanese book store in the netherlands
  i guess that one is/was in amstelveen
  i guess its gone now    have any of you tried ordering through amazon japan i cant get past checkout
  the one in amstelveen/amsterdam is gone    i have bought various items on amazon japan however i send my items to a japanese address i also know people who send their items overseas through amazon japan but not all items are eligible for that
  maybe he should try working with other photographers and see what they do differently from him instead of getting stuck in the same cycle of only seeing and looking back on your own work you can learn a lot and improve with a fresh pair of eyes
  heard that he is actually doing so already i think he indeed saw the messages here as a so called wake up call that he isnt as good as he thought
    well i hope for him he gets to improve then a lot of people just want to improve and get better without putting any actual effort in it improving takes time but many dont wanna take that time
  and a talented eye  some people just dont get better with time and effort
  i think this sums it up pretty nicely  viencon is great if you want a weekend hanging out with friends and meeting some other people you usually see only at conventions  animecon is great if you want to completely dive into it all and especially on cosplay and content no other event comes remotely close of course it costs more but content to price ratio they are probably the cheapest out there but that applies only if you make use of the program  then of course there are the comic cons which is just a great concept you create a market and charge on all sides  charge the dealers charge the visitors and charge for everything they can on the inside pretty neat    but in general our conventions are ridiculously cheap anyway if you compare it with for instance mcm london you pay more than an animecon ticket and all you get is a glorified dcc not even talking about the prices for food and drinks    and if you compare it with events in other branches you basically pay twice as much for something similar at least
which con feels the most like a 20012006 con
  unfortunately animecon also attracts a lot of people wo just want attention by showing their boobs had a lot of moments where someone with a full home made armor got neglected because some chick was showing off her front side
  youre saying this as if there is something wrong with that
  yes there are 3 things wrong with that   1 real effort doesnt get the recognition it deserves  2 it becomes one big competition who has the biggest tits this ruins the atmosphere  3 the attention these women get makes them super arrogant and annoying
  how does who got the biggest tits competition ruin the atmosphere if anything it only adds to the atmosphere salty because yours are flat
  i am not a fan of armour i am more of a show boobs kinda cosplay person
        if the armour or elaborate cosplay is good enough itll totally eclipse all the boobcosplays ive had it happen before all photographers suddenly went for the armour instead of bikini cosplayers the looks of disappointment on their faces were sweeeeet    that said it needs to be good enough if your armour is handmade but looks it dont expect photographers to ditch eyecandy for paper mache looking armour
  i feel like thats what is ussually the case that you have spend months at home working with foam does not mean it automaticly looks good you can hate on the photographers for going for the tits but its true if the cosplay is really good there is no tits in the world that can take the attention off from it but yeah like always people got to find a reason for something other then maybe they just need to improve their own work
  different anon but anyway a competition like that would just be boring and i guess boring things do ruin atmospheres
  im still not agreeing tits are never boring
  they are if youre gay  but thats not the point first and foremost cosplay should be for everyone without always making a competition out of it when you do make a competition out of it it should be a competition of skill and not a competition of tits
  why should it be of skill who decides this is that a law its just your opinion maybe others find it should be indeed about tits there is no law what cosplay should and shouldnt be its like that same old story about buying vs making cosplay it should not matter if a photographer decides he/she rather go for tits than handcrafted armour that should not matter cosplay com is supposed to be this open minded people but if you like tits then suddenly youre a bad person
  uhcosplay competitions are like art competitions becauseits art generally the competitions are composed of crafting skill acting props and stage presence   for what you want youre better off at pageants and miss universe kind of catwalks or wet tshirt competitions but what youre looking for is not to be found in a cosplay competition
the problem with the current coscom is that you are forced to be open minded tbqf
  yeah really i hate out of character cosplays/shoots lewd kanna people cosplaying their favorite character but then chosing to do the most underdressed version saeko in just a thong and apron or random armored blank or casual cosplay where nothing is the color or style the character would wear
  but if you voice your opinion youll get attacked cosplay is for everyone yeah by everyone i mean no matter what sex religion skincolor disability etc things people dont choose for not for those who choose to be thots choose to cosplay popular characters to get attention who try to get famous by spamming their pictures everywhere
wow the usual salty sexy vs armor discussion this is a never dying concept because people dont understand since cosplay has grown so big there isnt just a single demographic in the cosplay scene  never was to start with but still     you have the cosplay as in armor crafting photo and video competitions etc which is a small section  and the salty armor people think this is somehow the biggest in cosplay scene as a whole which actually work and are active in this scene cosplayers and photographers    you have the visitors fans etc who like the cosplay scene for these type of people and go to their booths cosplay themself  the noob first bought cosplay of hatsune miku  and go crazy when seeing those stage costumes for example at blizzcon    then you got the biggest group which are the pervy girls and guys online and on cons that come for the simple sex sells part those in it know there is money attention and growth regarding social media and financial gain simply because it is true the fact you hating on thots because they dominate that market is stupid because you are not on that market yourself if you are cosplayer who crafts does competitions etc    if you are regular/pro cosplayer why would you want the attention etc from the sexy/thot demographic you just attract different type of people i wonder if there is a cosplayer/person who is a cosplayer that can explain why you want the thot fans perhaps   
  i wouldnt want those people because i have a lot of fights with them theyre used to showing their tits and have everyone serve them on their knees when exposed long enough to this they become freaking arrogant  this becomes problematic when youre a gopher and they need you to do a favor they expect me to also serve them on their knees but since im not doing that they start scolding me and calling me names etc the love live ladies are the worst in this regard my girlfriend doesnt have this problem since they dont expect her to fall for their boobs but they do expect this from me and that becomes nasty pretty quickly
  oh god the love live girls are absolutely the worst theyre such keyboard warriors too i remember all those dance groups bitching and crying about tomos stage and wanting to start to boycot them people put their on their facts and never heard anything about it afterwards such crybabies who think they can become some sort of uwu aidoru while theyre all chicks who cant dance to safe their life
  who are these love live girls pics
  literally every love live girl with an exception to a few that are just there because they like the cosplays/characters and try not to be a part of the community that much
  i think people are overestimating cosplay in terms of value in this regard i mean fair enough makeup artists are makeup artists but generally cosplay doesnt really feel all that creative as its mainly just referencing whats been made before you just continue upon what somebody else did so imo it falls a bit short to be compared to something that is purely generative  although i can get into the fact that competitions are like art as theatre/dance are  like it has many creative aspects sure but in the end were mainly just copying anime waifu created by somebody else
  what about ocs then
  thinking any of these still post on the thread  this is like thinking you can summon leprechauns without making references to armour      ay      acting    i think theres about 1 in 10 acts that isnt lackluster on almost half of the things its trying to do besides that i do agree with you cosplaying takes a massive amount of skill and work       the gist is not that youre referencing something its about the fact youre bringing something to life youre connecting artwork if we want to call weebshit anything like that to reality by creating costumes immersive settings and anything akin to it    and because in that translation of fiction to reality you have lots of leeway for artistic direction etc id say its decently artsy    as an actor with only a bit of background in the coscom im not sure if id call the acts something mediocore in the theatre departement though art is in the eye of the beholder if they say its art then it is
i just cosplay because its fun and i like the characters
  how dare you you absolute lovelife cosplay is not for fun its for a false sense of superiority and to harbour an everlooming fear of failure and deadlines
  please dont get me started about gophers because if there is one group at cons who are really horrible its gophers with their smug faces thinking their above the rest all horny from their authority every single con once i enter the building and i see them i really look away because their faces just makes me puke no you did not achieve anything and no youre not better than the rest in fact you might be even worse than the rest all you did was sign up and work your ass off unpaid when i see a gopher all i think is haha another idiot who is slaving all day for a free con ticket
  nice bait buddy ive never been a gopher myself but your comment on them makes me puke stop stereotyping every gopher just because you had a bad experience with one of them on some 5 euro con and actually sign up to a con and see how hard of a work it is  lots of these guys actually do it to help out the convention and are passionate about their role in helping out  sure there are some of them just doing it for a free con ticket but surely not all  you got me whiteknighting boy thats how cancerous your post was
    i went to one of their meetings to take pictures almost none of them thanked me for the pictures i took i admit that they werent great but seeing the conditions i had to shoot in they could have said thanks
  yes and your behaviour only confirms what type of people gopher the whiteknighting im better than everyone person too dumb to see cons are just using you as free labour sure youre doing it for the love but its also possible without that im above you additude at cons sure caling all love livers the same is oke but when someone steps on your little gopher dick youre all feelings hurt
  i think theres about 1 in 10 acts that isnt lackluster on almost half of the things its trying to do besides that i do agree with you cosplaying takes a massive amount of skill and work    god dont get me started on the bad voice acting as well i would love more theatrics in cosplay that doesnt suck arse
  then lets start a con without gophers  oh wait we already got one
  which is
  they want the thot fans because they also want a lot of attention and love being in the spotlight
anyone going to guildgames the failure part 2 i think its somewhere in december theyre promising an even bigger cosplay contest now
  as organizer i can really tell we can do without you not without gophers so please stay away from conventions thanks
  it takes more effort to translate and make an existing design than to make an original costume because if something doesnt work out you can change it while with cosplay you stick to the reference material
  offcourse you cant do without gophers free employees but saying you can do without the visitors because thats what i am thats like the dumbest thing i ever heard
  technically its easier to make an oc sure but its gonna take a hell of a lot work to make an interesting oc before you touch the sewing machine the definition of oc generally seems to be just pulling on your fav wig  some random bits n pieces from other cosplays add smokey eyeshadow and bam theres your oc
  no stop placing words in my mouth   we can do without you a stuck up never worked a moment for anybody else in his/her life diva visitors are needed you as a single person can stay away really divas are generally more of a nuisance than the money the ring and if all visitors would be like that do you think we would organize anything    but you seem to be a lost cause anyway if you think gophers or volunteers are just free employees if you dont understand what drives a convention from staff to gopher l volunteers and all others adding to it in their spare time then you seem to missing something totally else and that is something to be pitied
  tomoparty it s literaly only the tomo core staff
  tomo and its volunteers are shit anyway
cosplayclues is dead
  nah clueybankruptcy is just their latest product announcement
  cosplayclues  who
  they said they need stability on facebook its still pretty vague for me why they stopped doing it i thought it went well with their shop from what ive heard
  then our opinions differ  i think the team is pretty motivated but they try to do too much with too little people they have a chronic shortage of personnel and i dont see them fix it anytime soon given the negative attention they get all the time
  i just looked up their contest and saw that 1st and 2nd place both contain coupons for cosplayclues i wonder how they will fill that up
  i once volunteered for them i got no breaks and had to stand in the sun all day half of their gophers didnt do shit and the other half was treated like shit those good intentions are nowhere to be found nowadays
  its probably j or his girlfriend so i reckon he will be there if they are booked
  i gophered twice for them had to do the ticket scan the first time and the second time was in the gameroom at tomo amsterdam it was ok but very busy but for amsterdam the arranged an hotel room food during the day and afterwards we all went to a shoarma tent so for me it was ok   but i know what you mean about the amount of gophers the team during tomocon was only 6 persons thats a bit too less in my opinion for 2000  visitors
  huh yeah youre right well cosplayclues will close shop end of november so those coupons will not be valid theyll need to find a new sponsor
so hows that tweakers event anyone got an update on how their cosplay competition went or who won
  here are the entries for the tweakers cosplay competition jury prize of wow special edition went to delightify cosplay as brigitte from overwatch third place 100 went to apocalypse cosplay with athena from borderlands 2 second place 300 to clueless cosplay with male  female v from cyberpunk 2077 first place of 600 went to willow creative with her lightning tracer from overwatch heres a video of the entire competition     overall the con was pretty meh pretty small not that many cosplayers on the floor not that much tech stuff a lot of gaming competitions without casters so they werent very interesting to watch overall it was enjoyable but spending an entire day there was a bit too long causing boredom and hard to keep finding stuff to do if you didnt have access to the lan party still for a first time con by tweakers it was pretty decent they were hilariously underprepared for cosplay though they didnt even have any form of propcheck or any cosplay rules for that matter anyway heres a short video showing some stuff at the con 
  realized i forgot the picture
    there are some mixed feelings about tweakers gaming live event the event as a visitor incredibly poor cosplay outside of the competition is nonexistent entertainment pretty much nonexistent as well it was like firstlook except a lot tinier and a lan event stuck on to it firstlook minus the cosplay and shops that is    the cosplay competition had quite big money prizes so it attracted some hefty costumes the competition in it self went quite smooth communication clear and matters well arranged a small delay in judging not too bad because we were waiting in comfort all though i think the comfort was created by participants and cosplay helpers though  judging was a bit of a joke i felt they decided on their winners based on first impressions rather than actually taking a look at peoples work    will i go if there is a repeat if i have a contest winning costume yes otherwise not worth my money
     it was like firstlook except a lot tinier  i actually had quite some fun mainly because of the lack of visitors since i didnt need to stand in line for over an hour every time i wanted to try a game    the event does have some potential they should add a market with that they can use the income from dealers to bring more entertainment since 1/3rd of the space wasnt really used
  there were no dealers because the event was quite quickly set up and in order to attract dealers you need to convince them that there will be enough customers to make it worth their attendance any future event will probably have a market  pretty sure firstlook next year will either be gone or just as small i remember 2017 was already laughably small
  for cosplayers didnt they have to deliver wip before the event maybe they already figured out a couple potentials before the actual judging started
    damn those are some pretty good and talented looking cosplayers i wonder why we dont hear about them more often or am i just living underneath a rock
  uhh there were big names you dont recognize any ilunaneko levylike lucidbelle sammyscosplay willow creative dutch dovahkin tomvdcr non stop props apocalypse cosplay and the newly arrival delightifycosplay are probably some of the biggest ones
  some of them are not as active but most of them are names that have been around for a while  1000 euros prize money does tend to atract people with skill
    yep money brings all the people to the yard
  of all of those i only recognize ilunaneko sammy  willow creative i really like ilunaneko and willow sammy i dont really care much for the others seem pretty cool and ill definitely check them out its time for cosplayers with decent skill
so who else saw these marvel cosplayers in the newspapers trying to sell themselves over stan lees death
  i think most people did talking about bad taste
    one mans death is another cosplayers bread amiright
  i did and like most i too found it highly disrespectful to sell yourself like this over ones death from what ive heard they contacted metro themselves for this article something which doesnt surprise me at all from these two one is an ancient relic who desperately clings onto what little relevancy she has left the other is a nobody who pretends to be an important figure in the community    link to the article for those who missed it       at least it shows their true colours
people want attention and money that is unheard of
  people talking about people with no shame that is unheard of
  i agree this is plain attention whoring adding their pages and even starting a condoleance register and commemoration at dutch comic con     also couldnt said relic get a better picture for the article hela shows how haggard her face is
it seems the whales in our community have been swimming in some extra salty waters lately they even manage to drag some of their asskissing photographers with them
  what are you talking about
  can you be even more vague
      the one swimming in salty waters seems to be you tho who hurt your feefees
chubby girl maid café would be cute
who are the dcc cosplay guests   are there any
  i know the cosplay judges are 2 people from italy daisy_cosplay and imrielcosplay and naythero  havent seen any other announcements but i know some international cosplayers such as bakka cosplay and ali cosplay and props are coming too not sure if theyre guests/booth or just visitors
  no
does anyone know where to buy warm preferably wool white ivory or cream tights i kind of need them before monday so i dont want to order online
miss smirk/dutch cosmunity has been mentioned a few times now and i really just want to add some oil to the fire im getting sick of her    the goddamn failure of her anti bulli cosplay calendar kickstarter earlier this year  apparently she wanted to be part of the official dcc team didnt get trough and then started a petition so people could sign their support for her  she still pretends to be part of dcc in a very shady way she was recruiting cosplayers for her cosmunity booth and started her pitch talk to them with hey do you want to be a cosplay guest for dcc which is a fckin lie they are cosslaves for her stand not a guest for fucks sake  the recruited cosplayers for said stand are barely credited   the aforementioned stan lee condoleance register  the photoshoots she organized at the end of the days when you visit the event page it seems like its officially for and from dcc it is not  now she also has a cosplay repair point and she got pissed how there is already others organized by actual cosplay supply stores not people who barely make their own cosplay stuff themselves  just the fact she gets pissy or goes in denial when she finds out people talk about her or speak up about her attention whoring in her face    i probably missed things but whatever i dont give a shit about costhots or attention whores i however get really pissy about people who pretend to be important while they arent promise all kinds of perks to unknowing people and claiming to be some sort of all holy anti bulli cosplay community
  i am so done with the plz no bulli owo mentality    back in my days you had a choice grow a spine and stop being a baby or shut up and be a silent baby
  bullying is part of how animals and people work it creates sociale controle in this community just straight up giving someone feedback or constructive criticism doesnt land well in this particular community where everyone seems to be a social outcast
  owo not everyone can be a kanjer tijger except for my fursona
  that charity calendar idea of hers was nothing but a classic pyramid scheme scam cosplayers had to pay her to be on that calendar and this alone would cover the entire costs of production and shipping of the calendar next everyone on the calendar would receive 5 copies for free which they could sell to family and friends to break even or make a small profit themselves at no point would she had been in any financial risk and even with the astronomically small cut for charity a charity which by the way wasnt even aware of her plans despite her claiming otherwise she could had easily ended up with a 4figure profit its also worth mentioning she didnt even had a designer for the calendar and expected some volunteer to design 365 pages  a cover for free as its a charity project    in my personal opinion that girl is only out to make herself look important and will do anything to make others believe she is as a person she claims to do everything for the good of the community yet has has zero integrity and no issues with blatantly lying to people as she did to the dcc cosplay guests she invited she cant handle any competition in the same field as her and will try to have them removed out of spite when confronted by constructive criticism she refuses to listen and stubbornly goes on with her plans only to blame others for not supporting her when her plans inevitably fail even after her blatant lies get exposed to the public shell stick to her story and complain some more about how mean some people are personally i find that to be her worst trait especially considering she sees herself as some pr superstar while in reality her pr skills are at the same level as fandom weekend    im glad dcc turned her down for a staff position you know power hungry people like her are the last you can trust with a position of power as has been proven in the past time and again
i love how that rekindle movie project is trying to get propmakers trough cosplayclues but the name of the project is left out of the original post    says enough doesnt it
first go of rekindle was a hot mess second go they are trying to trick everybody to work for the oh so sought after valuable currency of exposure
at first it made me kinda sad that wickedwigs only sponsored costhots but then i realised that no selfrespecting cosplayer want to be seen in a wig of theirs
  but anon they arent just offering you exposure they are offering you 12 exposure thats like 2 times more exposure than 6 exposure just think of all the cool stuff you can do with that amount of exposure so many possibilities you are passing on for not wanting to be paid in exposure
  oh damn i know the director i guess his band isnt doing well enough and tries to make money elsewhere
  lmao they came knocking on various cosplayers and propmakers doors only to be sent away with a if youre not paying were not making it     turns out they didnt even know what they wanted in the first place
  is wickedwigs really that bad i mean i agree some of their wigs look kind of questionable in quality and especially their lacefronts look a bit eh but on the other side their instagram features a few posts where their wigs can look pretty nice    coming from someone who has never ordered from them before by the way i stick to coscraft and kasou most of the time i do see wickedwigs pop up every now and then so i got curious
  i feel like their wigs are way overpriced for how thin they look never owned or tried a wickedwig though
  the wigs look great on fluffy girl but when the owner tries them in herself it always looks so shit she is her own antiadvertisement    i have 1 wig by them quite nice quite expensive overall quality cant judge overall price expensive
  except for the calendar i thought you were talking about someone else
  meanwhile im just waiting here for a plus size cosplayer to look up to fluffy is damn good looking but then shes basically a costhot just think it would be nice to see good cosplays coming from a person that isnt size 36/38 the only dutch one that i can think of is mmmc royal icing
  i know someone who asked them for a commission but it looked like shit the styling was done so poorly what a waste of money
  why would you need a plussize cosplayer to look up to their craft is the same as any other cosplayer but without the im plussize so people are mean to me but im keeping my confident attitude whining
  got more thats hilarious
want to do a photoshoot  approach multiple photographers for this  maintain absolute radio silence for several weeks while i pick who will have the exclusive honour of shooting with me and my man glasses  dont listen to deleted anon hes just salty he didnt win my little competition
  what kind of shitty personal life does she have that she craves feeling important so much
different anon  serious question why were the previous comments about miss smirk deleted did they violate any boardrules
  most likely because it included her name which could be a violation of board rule 2 dont bring community vendettas onto this board so going out individual cosplayers for the purpose of trolling them will not be tolerated depending on the active mods
so i heard wannabe loish has her own stand at dcc
    maybe we should call her discount loish from now on
  she always had
  oh shes still active i havent heard anything about her anymore i had no idea she was still relevant
  discount kamui discount loish discount leon chiro sounds good
  i saw she is doing a book presentation at the cozy corner program is online today      its vendetta which is against the rules      who is our discount leon chiro
    and whos our discount kamui lol
  willow creative
  i think you mean pretzl she literally made a book om working with worbla/foam as well
  no it was a joke with willow creative being named in the actual talent in cosplay thread and someone called her a discount kamui   i do wonder who the discount leon chiro is is it hakan
  i wonder as well however i dont think its hakan i thought he crafts most his props himself
this thread has gone smooth and as such has become worthless as a screw yeah im really scraping the barrel of thread word puns here anyway heres a new thread 
the new thread got nuked from orbit after people broke /cgl/ rule number 2 dont bring community vendettas onto this board singling out individual cosplayers for the purposes of trolling them will not be tolerated    a new thread postdcc edition can be found at 
also known as the i dont want to talk about that idiot that threatened the con that thankfully didnt show up edition    previous thread 
  thank you anon that was getting so annoying    sage for no contribution
its time to let it go for another year at least
  or october when that pier thing happens in nyc
  i think this is going to bethe last one the previous thread just had their images capped out is all  anyways great con this year
is anyone going to anime california
  im considering going because i live nearby why
  sounds good heard mixed reviews though so im on the fence on it
  just trying to get an idea for how popular its gonna be theyre saying they estimate 2000 people      this years may as well be a completely new con since its being managed by new people the only thing they kept was the name
  did anybody actually dress like that here because that would be awesome
  aniplex booth had gudako
im going to post the rest of my set its only nine photos
  oh no shes so so cute but her coord is so so terrible i hope she improves she could be a beautiful lolita one day
  she had an orbiter with her he looked kinda pathetic thats how it is i guess
this dude at the last day of the con
i liked her butt
  why do guys tend to have better legs than the actual bitches
    lets see how long we can stretch this thread    taking requests on what people would like to see
  this is the first thing i thought of
  any more bunnysuit girls
heres my gallery of all four days      ill post a handful in this thread
time to let it all out for good    ax 2018 highlights  ax 2018 regrets  plans for ax 2019
  highlights  getting to meet my cosplay friends for the first time and hanging out with them for the whole weekend was more fun than i couldve imagined including the after hours outings  regrets  i assumed the friends i met wouldnt want to spend the whole weekend with me so i made plans to stop by certain booths and panels and i feel bad that i missed out on some potentially good merch
more pics please
  highlights  vip aquors good seats for other 2 concerts ran into a good friend mysteriously often got a shikishi board from bisuko ezaki as well as menherachan merch dan salvato gave me a sticker and we took a few photos together got to be in a cosplay video and all of my cosplay gatherings were fun  regrets  couldnt get into the jojo  ddlc panels because i didnt line up quick enough didnt take much photos because too hot to do anything slept in everyday because depressed
  plans for ax 2019  its sad that it has to be done but next year im bringing mints and giving them to anyone sitting next to me with awful breath like 5 different panels were basically ruined for me because the person sitting next to be had awful breath
  aww you poor thing
  ax 2018 highlights  love live concert shoko nakagawa concert after a bunch of 4/10 idol groups getting laid with a cute chubby guy gay fatchaser here  ax 2018 regrets  watching mari okadas forced feelsfest instead of going to the trigger panel or buy more crap at the dealers hall i only watched it because it wasnt going to be showing in my hellhole of an area and it turned out it was going to show in my hellhole area a few days after the con bought gravity falls on bluray at ax after finding out my package was sent to my brother while he was vacationing overseas and it also rained meaning i thought my package was destroyed turned out the package was safe as soon as he came back from vacation and i now have a second copy of the box set at least i dont have to spend money for my nieces this christmas i guess also found out bushiroad had a booth with shit to buy at the last possible second on the final day and everything was sold out  plans for ax 2019  i dunno for sure kinda conflicted that a bear / chub run again gay fatchaser here is going to be a few weeks before ax and can only spend on one big event next summer most likely gonna pick ax over the bear run but it still sucks though that i have to choose between getting laid for an entire week or the biggest anime convention in america
  no one enjoys sitting next to someone with terrible breath or bo
  try dealing with that smell after they down a few drinks
how easy is it to hook up with cosplaying girls at these sorts of conventions
   2018 highlights  bought a shitton of stuff in the artist alley  dealers hall a qt girl excitedly told me she thought my mikan from sdr2 cosplay was perfect     2018 regrets  first time going to ax/being in la and i ended up being unprepared for the heat got really sick and missed a bunch of the con had some bad cosplay malfunctions and ended up not cosplaying most of the conmissed out on a meet up with this itabagging group im a part of because of sickness depressed on the ride home because i felt like i totally wasted my chance to have a blast at ax because i got sick and some other bullshit      for ax 2019  probably wont be going again until at least 2020 but i definitely want to go again to make up for the shitty time i had this year
  if you have to ask then the answer is no
  highlights  just being there was fun it was my first year also seeing all the cosplayers was great for me and i got some neat merch  regrets  not being financially prepared not cosplaying missing out on the darkstalkers cosplay meetup and not being able to stay at the con past 8 because of transportation reasons  plans for 2019  maybe get a cosplay going and try to go to more panels also be a bit more prepared for next time  i had a 4 day pass from my friend who was working at the con too bad she was busy most of the con i only got to hang out with her for 1 day feelsbad
  highlights  the fashion show and amv panels as well as karaoke   regrets   should have planned better financially and been more prepared and i wish i had more time to cosplay/more time to learn cosplay photography also thinking i could ghost it   plans for ax 2019   i want to try my hand at making merch so i can be in artist alley in a few more years i want to go to the masquerade and be in the fashion show
did anybody see some old guy that looked like grr martin i was so tempted to get a picture but i wasnt really sure if that was cosplay
saw this shimakaze cosplayer at the con and in this video anybody know her name/page name
  his name is kevin
  the mirai future sound thing was not worth it
  thats a man
  she goes by lint she also cosplayed as nitocris
  just as easy as hooking up with normal girls except with an additional handicap if youre also in cosplay and have similar interests
  the odds are better than being a gay fatchaser thats looking for hookups  all cute chubby guys that take care of themselves no bo/bad hygiene at these cons are straight  found only two diamonds in the rough at ala and ax after all 13 years as a congoer
  ax 2018 highlights  hanging with friends drinking with friends seeing cute girls and cosplay  ax 2018 regrets  being fat  plans for ax 2019  losing weight and having a bigger ax budget
  highlights  great first con experience watched a bunch of premieres seeing cosplayers in person seeing seiyuu in person and watching orchestr/a/ perform live  regrets  no money not cosplaying not eating not socializing not going to any concerts not going to previous years how do people have time to do things when youre in line half of the time  plans  still on the fence on going next year    here are my blurry photos from my phone 
  what was so bad about it i didnt go since the japanese djs played at otaquest
been crossplaying every ax so far was nep this year this year was a blast heat was shit lines were shit bo was shit would con again
  ax 2018 highlights  made it into the trigger group autograph session  ax 2018 regrets  none i guess though it did suck having pretty much no crazy good goh aside from the above industry guests and world premiers ruined this years goh lineup   for ax 2019  returning to poverty badge after 4 years as premier and hoping im not fucked out of a good panel because of it
  back to r9k/fit incel
i posted before ax about a job interview i was going through and worried itd overlap with the con  ax was great  the company didnt schedule anything during that entire week  just got the job offer today    ty /cgl/ dream job and will have a huge budget next ax
  yayy
  no because august cons in socal dont last long ac will disappear again after a one year wonder
go to bait and buy exclusive gold bruce lee pops to give to a few friends and sell a few  dirty weebs ask me why im always early  tell them about exclusive bruce lee pops  they shrug and tell me about the bushiroad merch booth  i thought funko pops were popular with they kids these days
  thats good what kind of job is it
  it was a bit pricey given that half of the setlist were literal whos that played their own original songs yuce and taku takahashi were great though     i went to mogra which was fun although a sausage fest couldnt make it to otaquest unfortunately
neon district 2 please
  engineering 100 work from home as well      this so much neon district was such a great way to end ax last year
  ghost it
  otaquest was edm hell  nowhere to dance  no reentry  6 hours of untz untz untz    i went mostly to see crystal kay and was beyond pissed when she only sang two songs the djs that came before her were some of the worst that ive seen it was like a mediocre la club set
  yuce  teddyloid  some of the worst  anon pls but yeah otaquest choosing microsoft theater was pretty questionable
  i saw plenty of people warning before hand that otaquest parties were shit glad to see it was true
  yeah as soon as i saw it in the microsoft theater i knew itd be shit who thought that was a good idea    i really wanted to go but no way i wanted to drink and listen to untz not stand in one spot like a retard
  dumb boomer
  sneak in without a badge
  still doable but you need at least two willing friends with badges
everyone went to the fakku x mogra dance that had a line going out the door    when the ax dance was literally the next door down the hall with instant entry and wt snacks    why
  because the ax dance was for weenies
  i like the mogra djs and wanted to see them also the line was surprisingly fast got in after 3040 mins of waiting
  ax 2018 highlights  going in costume for a first time ive been attending for 9 odd years but this was the first that i actually wore a costume i had a spectacular time people even asked for my picture and recognized me lots of compliments from artists in aa and a set of people at a booth that were just so lovely it made my year    ax 2018 regrets  working so hard and losing sleep over a prop that got destroyed within literally 5 minutes of walking into dealers hall despite being a centimeter larger than the width of my petite body    plans for ax 2019  im making my next costume ahead of time and its going to be summery because fuck the heat
  thats fantastic i remember your post about it before glad everything worked out anon
  oh and another regret was not taking enough pictures of myself or others too much to do not enough time i want to go one day next year in costume and one without
  oh  sunday no one checked my badge or anything probably could have just wandered in off the street with a waterbottle filled with gin and nobody wouldve given a shit i wasnt even in costume that day
  well lets see a pic of the finished prop obvs
  did sushio sketch anything for you
  since day 3 was day 2 overflow continuation there wasnt time for detailed sketches like he showed on his twitter day 1 and 2 instead of settling for a wacky doodle which isnt why i lined up i went with a simple signature on a klk weiss schwarz card
  weiss schwarz  spending money on a fucking convoluted as fuck game
  say this on a board where people spend money making/buying costumes and going/spending money at cons  get off your high horse
  day 1 leftover here we got pushed to day 2 after a half hour they had us go first because they felt bad for us probably four hours total in just that autograph line at this point a little after i got my requests they stopped with requests period and sketched whatever they felt like wakabayashi was just doing simple stuff hes a producer anyway not everyone had requests for mori so i felt a little bad for him    i fully expected just a signature so it was worth waiting
  teddyloid and yuce were great but the guy that came before teddyloid was mediocre and the group of 3 guys that came after teddyloid was fucking horrible they just kept shouting their group name into the mic and showing off their embroidered jackets it was ridiculous
  please tell me you sat through nakatas set
  i didnt i left right after crystal kay was he better or worse than teddyloid
  highlights  saved money this year  regrets  money was saved because i didnt go  plans  not sure about going because a lot of people are saying it just keeps getting worse
there are people who would want ax to move to san diego and comic con to la
  really i hear more people wanting ax to move back to anahiem
  anon nakatas set was incredibly great so was mflos also crystal kay came back to sing another song during mflos part  i do agree that masayoshi iimoris set was pretty lame it was probably the worst one there funnily enough the audience wasnt that pleased either more people sat down and there werent as many glow sticks up
  whoops meant to quote 
  im 20 minutes from the la convention center so i really hope it stays here going to ax would get significantly more expensive for me if it were to move
  ax to sd i can see because its a bigger convention center with better panel rooms to work with also way more hotels it wont happen because la will fight to keep ax     who the hell has told you they want sdcc in la more commonly i hear move sdcc to vegas and those are people who dont have two brain cells to rub together yeah a con in the summer in vegas heat that sounds great its 101 right now and its almost 11pm
so when is the expansion happening
  never  not even sdcc can get their expansion to start
  minkmintcosplay
  i hear people wanting sdcc to move to vegas
  regrets  i wish id cosplayed but to pull off the character i had in mind i wouldve had to buy new glasses frames and lenses and my vision is so shit that lenses cost over 300 like when people ask are you nearsighted or farsighted i dont know how to respond because i cant even read unless an object is right up against my face and anything further out is blurry
  nearsighted or farsighted  cant even read unless an object is right up against my face    anon you answered your own question
  i cant make out distant objects either everything is out of focus unless its within a two inch radius of my eyes which is why i bring lube to ophthalmologist appointments
  can only see shit right next to your face  gee i wonder if im nearsighted  it has near in the name ffs
how many more years is ax contracted to be at the lacc
  also crystal kay came back to sing another song during mflos part    it wasnt konnani chikaku de was it
  youre right im retarded
  next year is the last year for the current contract i believe
  i wouldnt mind it moving to anaheim never been to an anaheim ax but ive been to several cons in that anaheim convention center area and it would be pretty sweet to see that entire area with the convention center and hotel full of cosplay and stuff and downtown disney is only a few blocks away
  you know that place down the street from the convention center what used to be there
  right i mean vegas is where cons retire    the laws of that city is toxic to cosplay
  a hotel going through the convention center    hopefully they generously expand the parking
  never been to an anaheim ax  then you really missed out
  wanting to go to anaheim ax  you really want to go back to an ax when they didnt have their shit together yet  heres hoping they do once that lacc contract expires
  does anyone have pics of that cute lupin the 3rd cosplayer he was doing the red jacket version
fantasizing about a cosplayer i took a photo with  lets look at the photo again so i can remember what they look like clearer huehue  photo has them with the mask on  fuuuucjkjjkkkkk
  i feel like im not cute enough to get a mention here
   yyou too    do you have a discord or something
  i feel like im getting pranked but   ass 3370
  then you really missed out
anyone else remember the fight that happened at the dance hall and the guy got bloodied up i remember posting about it at the con cause i witnessed it
  what was that about
  man idk the guy just got into a fight with another guy and broke his nose
  ax 2018 highlights  honestly there arent any standout highlights for me this year i just loved being at a large con again talking to random people who have similar interests and seeing new things its a great experience    ax 2018 regrets  even though i rushed myself around a bit less then previous years i still kinda regret not trying to spend more time talking to people and walking through artist alley i really hope they expand the size given to artist alley again next year though this year was a huge step up from last year because they placed the tables intelligently    plans for ax 2019  im getting a hotel and finding random people to share it with for sure i cant handle the commute back to my place anymore do people from here organize that stuff through discord or something maybe i can go for that if not ill just find people from facebook or some shit
  im also interested in the hotel thing but would be too worried about getting shit stolen if i shared with a stranger whats the point in leaving all my merch in the hotel room if it ends up just getting stolen by some rando
    gotta find people you trust  reach out to your network of congoing friends and they can probably get you into something
  the only aneheim ax that ive been to was 2007    the skin concert line  the 56 hour line to get your badge  the lines alone made were awful  ax got better during recent years but then again i didnt go back to ax until 2015 when i finally got a job again
  ive shared with random people when going to other stuff never had an issue with people stealing esp for out of town people the logistics of it are just too annoying for people to actually do the deed considering the minor gains besides if you buy something actually expensive you can use the roomsafe
ax will never go back to anaheim la is too prime of an area to pass up on
can anyone recommend a cheap but not shitty hotel for ax im not from the us and im planning to go in 2019 with some friends
  whats your idea of cheap and whats your idea of not shitty
  howd you get so high up
  why
   i just loved being at a large con again  this sometimes i question why i still go to ax year and year again but it really boils down to this its such a unique experience
  nyart but it looks like the view from the staffonly floor
  if expansion gets started for the lacc they might have to go somewhere and expansion isnt unlikely considering e3 is apparently pushing hard for it
  money
    from the angle it is from the 2nd landing which they were blocking off this year i did see randoms walking around up there occasionally because they forgot to post a guard at the elevator though in previous years the public still got to go to the landing but not into the hallway i guess they changed that because you could theoretically see guests walk through said hallway    press/industry/staff/guests get to use that section of the top floor the press lounge industry lounge interview rooms staff rooms and press conference rooms are in that region
  2007 was long beach and my god that was a shitshow even without a large crowd   get a chance to get autographs from the female cast of haruhi   line caps at 50   met someone unlucky enough to be number 51   security tells people to leave their props before entering events   they get thrown out without warning   hot but not hot enough to be declared a heat wave   cell phone reception at exhibition hall was absolute shit  at least i got to see the concert
  if expansion gets started for the lacc they might have to go somewhere  they could lose comic con in a few years ax could be its replacement
  i did see randoms walking around up there occasionally because they forgot to post a guard at the elevator though  i did that lmao and thanks for the info
people believe 2019 is the last year for ax in lacc  word on the street is that the spja just signed a long term deal to stay in la long term meaning 10 years
  i cant seen ax lasting that long
  how the fuck would it not  even if attendance dropped by 20 theyd still be fine
  ax is printing money right now theyve been in the black for a couple of years now and if anything its just going to get worse its sdcc but a few years in the past just wait til it starts selling out and people actually have to rush to buy tickets more and more fans are coming into money from jobs and that means theyve got more to spend in general on a con and at the con
  why not on attendance alone theyre making a fuckload of ticket sales hell this year it felt like there may have been too many people because of how hard it was to get through crowds sometimes then you factor in merch ticketed events ect and theyre doing fine
  bunny girl was doing really nice posing
  ax is printing money right now theyve been in the black for a couple of years now  t paid spja shill
so while were on the topic of la anybody going to nisei week
  ugh hell no
  never been before how is it im interested in checking it out
  im gonna pass by on the 11th or 12th for the tanabata festival
  ax 2018 highlights  making out with a random grill during the parking lot party getting a thicc grills number and getting a kiss on the cheek from her at the same party getting really drunk at the parties and at the westin actually getting in shape from last year had a lot of cute grills mire me i would pretend not to look but saw them staring   ax 2018 regrets  getting really shitfaced and being hung over on sunday also almost losing my best friends over me being a drunk asshole i worked it out with one i still need to talk to the other one  wasting most of my money on shirts and alcohol   plans for ax 2019  stay and get more /fit/ save more money and get a hotel at one of those fancy ones also throw a room party to pay forward for all those parties ive been to
one post per 3 days were taking this to 2019
  you can look at their public tax documents like it or not they have a surplus that is growing every year if you go back far enough you can see where they were very much in the red
  cant say for sure because i went there for one day and it was by accident i think i want to check it out now all i know is they have food vendors    on a related note i am sad to find out real escape game closed their los angeles location that place was a lot of fun
  so while were on the topic of la  did anyone go to animanga in pomona i heard it was small and shitty i dont get why you would have a socal con on evo weekend
  it looked like everything was in a long hangar    i just want to know whats up with anime california and if its gonna be worth checking out its next week and theres no schedule out yet
  its basically a first year con that has the name of a previous but unrelated con treat it as a first year con
the ax booth at nisei week had free ax posters and ax pins today that was pretty neat
this is probably a longshot  did anyone else go to the all the feels panel and have a link to the grave of the fireflies amv that was shown  saw the movie in theater today and now i want to share the suffering even more with my friends who went with me
  i went to support a friend and honestly for 10 bucks a day it was pretty solid one of the aa vendors had my super obscure game merch and the evo streaming was fun 8/10 would go again if its that cheap
2019 here we come
im looking for an album of kancolle cosplayers this year at ax anyone has a link
  jesus christ the girl on the left is an absolute cutie    ive no interest in aot but she could just flash a smile and id marathon it
  where was the parking lot party and what was it like
tfw the staples center area is closed off for cosplayers and traffic for axfags for this shit tier pop star twat  i know this shit is only for one day but the walking traffic to getting to an back for ax and the ridiculously judgmental looks from most likely underaged tweens with shit taste in music will be a goddamn nightmare
  highlights  going to the anisong concert just to see sayuri then walking out going to the kengan asura premiere and being the only person cheering when the producer mentioned gakkou gurashi meeting people in the japanese music/rhythm game community  regrets  working a booth wasnt too bad but i know i missed out on a lot i definitely didnt drink enough this year i missed getting some merch like the gfl bag didnt take many cosplay pics or see many qt cosplayers i was at cwf but then got messaged by 3 different old friend groups from high school who wanted to meet up and i pretty much bailed on all of them  2019 plans  idklol
  there is something extremely eerie about the eyes in this photo they look like theyve been painted over in photoshop or something theyre really uncanny valley looking
  dammit it was noticeable wasnt it i tried to fix the red eye and move the shine
  yeah you went way overboard its the first thing i noticed because it looks so unnatural the sclera are too white/bright for the lighting so its giving the irises a contrasty painted appearance maybe go over it again and try to lower the contrast i dunno redeye/shine can be hard to fix
i would appriciate it if anyone that stayed at the luxe for days 04 could share how much they paid for a room per night and whether or not you booked the room before or during the ax hotel block period
  stayed at the luxe day 04 according to my receipt 255/night and thats with a total of 4 guests    also needs more pics
  what do i do when l dont know what to go as
  sdcc expansion is a bunch of local politics hotels want to be taxed instead of donate or raise prices themselves so they can get bonds and not have to pay for it
  kinda hoping that awm doesnt schedule a concert for that night
  most likely it will
  post in one of those what should i cosplay threads
  2 beds
  ye 2 beds the room itself was surprisingly big also i booked during the hotel block
does anyone have the ainz cosplay from ax
  this guy
nostalgia
  wt snacks is still alive
who waiting for black friday to get their badge
  they havent bothered increasing prices for a while so i probably am
will the nycc x ax need its own thread
  im waiting til january 2019 because my job changed systems meaning my time off for ax 2019 filed a few weeks ago on the old system are gone but the time off for ala did get approved though thank christ
  i dont think they would care ffs theres going to be more of us in costume/weeb gear than all of them waiting for the concert
did anyone go to axs event during nycc i heard it was a failure considering it was 5 blocks from the javits center and you needed a separate ticket to get in
i need some opinions i am thinking about going to a us con in 2019 i am from the uk and one of my friends recommended me ax is ax pretty good and is it worth travelling from abroad to attend     i had a few other recommendations too like katsucon otakon colossalcon and youmacon but i like the looks of ax the most
  its overcrowded and hot and if you want to go to any panel remotely popular get ready to wait 23 hours in line
  is ax pretty good   no hasnt been good since 2006  and is it worth travelling from abroad to attend  no you better off trying to get into sdcc if youre going for a us con
  sdcc as an analogue to ax  anime at sdcc    barring whatever famous shounenshit artist that viz brings every year anime at sdcc is fucking nonexistent
  is ax pretty good   it was at one point  and is it worth travelling from abroad to attend  none of the cons are worth that much travel besides sdcc i guess
  i dont want to go to another comic con desu im already getting bored of the uk london comic con    thanks anon
  as someone who hasnt ever been to a panel i dont know if i want my first experience to be me waiting outside for 23 hours
  but i really dont want to go to a comic themed con i want to experience an us anime con since the uk are lacking some is there any anime cons worth travelling to the us for
  another uk anon here  its only worth doing if youre visiting la as a whole to get the most out of the trip i only keep going back because of friends over there     as an anime con though its one of the best if you get past the crowds heat and shit staff
  thats the thing i wanna just go to the us for the convention i dont think there would be anything else id want to do there my friend who im taking with me said she wants to look around new york though     i will do some research on whats around la thank you anon
trigger panel at ax shows a bit of promare this year  trailer came out yesterday    this is gonna premiere at anime expo 2019 fucking calling it now screen cap that shit
  what are you most interested in a con the place is packed to the point of being a fire hazard but the cosplay is plentiful  fair warning parts of la is filthy no idea what the uk analogue would be
  the place is packed to the point of being a fire hazard  this i dont understand how they can keep getting away with packing the lacc without some fire marshal stepping in shutting the place down im all for a sdccstyle lottery at this point
  im most interested in looking at artist alleys as well as doing some photoshoots in cosplay at a con though im really curious about going to panels since ive never been to one    is la as filthy as london or at least some parts of london
  yes it is very filthy  oh ax has one of the most impressive aas in terms of number good for us but bad for them
  what about the panels are they any good
  it depends on if there is one about a topic you like i have only been to a few each year but not boring the rooms are usually packed and the waits are long
  world class usually usually some of the best guests and premieres in the country but that makes the line times for them massive had to wait 2 hours last year for the trigger panel the best strategy is to sit in the panel room through multiple panels beforehand to 100 be sure you got a seat
  is la as filthy as london  every major large city has its filth if you stick around the lacc la live up figueroa to the westin you are fine actually all the businesses and restaurants have slowly open up and embraced ax knowing its an annual cash cow along with e3 and comikaze expo before in its first 4 years many of the restaurants and hotels would treat ax guests like shit
  the only panel i go to every year is the trigger panel all the other industry and fan panels have been meh even the goh panels have sucked since they dont let the audience not ask questions anymore
first ax in years where ill actually have money to splurge on everything for the entire con    whats worth the money at ax gulls food and drink included
  its definitely not cosplay since you can see the same cosplayers at ala for 1/5th of the cost to go to ax
  if youre a gamer theres a booth at ax every year that has rare and imported games
anyone going to la comic con this weekend
  i missed the part where op fucking asked for your shilling
  still not dead
8 months
buy a pass now or wait for black friday
  this the next price tier is listed on the website 102 but it doesnt say when its going up i dont want miss out on the black friday prices but i hear they sell out really fast
imagine worrying about saving 20 over the course of an entire fucking year
  is ax worth it i didnt get tickets for sdcc this year and debating whether to volunteer at sdcc or skip it and try ax this year and see what its all about
  depends on what youre going for anime is by title going to be the dominating content at ax over sdcc if youre able to volunteer go to sdcc and come visit ax when you want a taste of something new
  ive been doing sdcc for about 13 years straight this year was the only one where i wasnt able to get a ticket at presale nor public i just nabbed volunteer because my hotel roommate always volunteers and it doesnt seem so bad over the normal ticket process thats why im debating whether to do ax or sdcc because work will only allow me time off for one i like anime tho all i do at sdcc is mainly go for autographs a couple of panels some casual photographing and since of 2018 now dnd money is no concern its just should i spend it on sdcc or try ax
  there is no black friday sale this year
  in that case come experience ax if money is no object then i think youll enjoy the luxuries of the premier pass aside from the activities at the con and your hotel you can explore la for a while in costume or around costumed people
  explain
    wish you wouldve been a little less ominous anon theres still a sale but itll be on cyber monday this year 
each year i question why i keep going back year after year it only gets more crowded and thus shit
  you save 9   9 fucking dollars
  i know its a slap in the face to call it a sale im buying the day after the con from now on it was insane how much i was stressing over whether to wait and risk missing out on saving nine fucking dollars but i didnt realize that until i was explaining the scenario to someone else seeing their are you shitting me face made me realize how stupid this was and i just leapt to buy the tickets ive spent more on food it aint gonna kill me
  premier pass  im currently on the fence trying to decide if i should go for the premier this time or not this will be my third year at ax and skipping the lines sounds amazing but 475 is pretty steep  do you have any experience with the rates and booking that premier pass owners get with hotels i have a friend considering going next year and a hotel might be fun is the premier rate for hotels actually a decent discount or is it a joke like 10 off
highlights   first ax   first time rooming with randoms and one of them was really chill ill get to the other two below  met a really cute ciri cosplayer and we hit it off we still talk online  got a ton of new art  managed to score some 151 rum which i cant buy where im from  jojos screening  regrets  being fat 320lbs to be exact  my roommate brought his guns to the hotel  my other roommate slept 18 hours a day so i couldnt host a room party   met a couple girls that offered to sleep with me for drinks they were 16  lines  got lost in some tent city in an industrial area while trying to find a party off site  and this is the worst of it saturday night i went to the jw marriot at around 2 am to meet some people they had this weird guy with them who had a fully nude darkness body pillow he had this creepy grin on as he tried to force him self on every girl in the circle we had formed i dont know why i complimented him on the fucking thing mdma but that made us best friends in his mind we were close enough apparently for him to tell me how much he hated his roommates not at the con with him and his fantasies about killing them thats when i left  next time not sure what year  im going with people i actually know  going to drop at least 100 lbs  never leaving the venue again  and im going to learn how to to tell weird people to fuck off
  slept 18 hours a day  the fuck  you can do it anon i believe in you      wow seriously fuck that
  the super limited sale price is 71 while the current tier is 80
  we hit it off we still talk online  cute
  met a couple girls that offered to sleep with me for drinks they were 16  what is it with the underage girls at ax  was in line ax 2016 to try out some vr game  started chatting with the people behind me and a girl and her guy friend  have a nice chat try out the game and say bye  later that day decide to get some overpriced food in the cafeteria area  run into them again  girl and i hit it off well asks for my number  meet up with her the next day and shes hanging off of me much to her friends annoyance  invite her to come with me to a late night panel  oh actually my moms picking me up at 9  turns out shes 16  i was 23  politely make some excuse and leave never talking to her again  its ridiculous how these girls pass for over 18 you pretty much have to card them now
  why are you complaining
  because i dont want to go to jail
  is there any anime cons worth travelling to the us for    no they all collectively went to shit post 2007    the only us cons worth travelling to the us for are sdcc and nycc even if you dont like comics that much anime cons are better in your own local community probably     ax is better run nowadays but pretty soulless i dont recommend it to people anymore i pretty much prefer the didnt know what the fuck they were doing days as they at least had more heart for what they were doing
  she had some kind of medical issue i didnt ask it didnt help that she was talking meds for it and washing it down with tequila when she was awake she just complained about her parents or banged 2nd amendment bro  and thanks for the encouragement

  going to meet my friend were both 30 but younger looking  he is chatting with some obvious teenager and drawing together  acts like he couldnt tell because she had big tits  happened all weekend
if you dont get a premier badge are you basically fucked in terms of getting a hotel close to the con also whats the average cost of the hotels nearby
  badges have no relation to hotel bookings
trying to get a premiere badge was a shitshow    thats a lie
  no i got a single bed room at the hotel indigo with a regular badge this year and i was able to upgrade to a 2 queen bed when i checked in 7 minute walk each way
  the premier rate for hotels actually a decent discount or is it a joke like 10 off  you dont get shit anything with premier pass in terms of hotel discount you just guarantee yourself a room within walking distance
  you can get a decent hotel from the ax hotel block without premier if thats what you mean the early premier booking is a completely separate tiny pool of rooms
  how much is the room
    id imagine ax hotels would sell out in 2 minutes of opening the block with how popular the con is is it a realistic expectation to wait until then and get a room
  no always plan ahead
anyone have any experience doing refunds on tickets my friend and i were planning on both getting premier tickets but the site didnt let him get in on time so i ended up being the only one to get a premier badge  i emailed the email address they list for requesting a refund on monday but havent heard anything back i wanted to try premier this year but i figure its a lot to risk on the panels not being good especially when my friend couldnt get in either
  i will buy it from you
reach end of the year  work gets so unbearable to the point that im not going to ax in 2019 to prioritize getting a better job
  what does having fun for 4 days have to do with getting another job i got a new job literally less than a month after anime expo this year
bnb just a short walk away from the con reserved  we in boys
  how much was it i have a friend thats considering going but the deciding factor for them is how much their portion of the hotel would cost
  360 each person for me and a friend although we got very lucky with a price like that i imagine based on last years hotel prices it looks like itll be about 200 a night from the official hotel block
  200 a night isnt actually that bad since you only really need three nights the last day you dont need to sleep there but it does make it tricky if you need a place to store your merch
not cramming 10 people into a hotel so you only pay 80 each  cmon now
just let this ancient thread die and start a 2019 one
  room looks like a 3rd world shit hole by the end of day 1
  i only feel comfortable rooming with very close friends i couldnt do that with a ton of random discord people
  i wouldnt trust random discord people enough to leave my shit in the hotel which seems like one of the biggest advantages of having one carrying around my merch gets tiring and its a bit of a hassle being at a crowded after party and having to carry a bag of shit with me

post collages of jfashion capsule wardrobe min 5 unique outfits  requests are welcome not limited to lolita either  feel free to post capsule wardrobes you found online like pic related whos an oldie but still works
  which is an oldie  my bad
this is my current wardrobe minus accessories  im trying to make it more capsuley and would love tips what do i need should i purge anything i love the concept of a cohesive capsule wardrobe but i always find myself with outliers and im not sure what to do with them keep them for that special occasion sell them and buy something that fits into the capsule better   theres also a wine innocent world sailor dress but i left it off because im at a complete loss of how to coord it
  i feel like the idea of capsule wardrobe is ideal but not really realistic since youre not going to like things that always match other things unless youre buying something that matches literally nothing else youve ever liked its really hard to stick with a certain combination of colors maybe its just me though   i adore your wardrobe so simple and cute id make a capsule but im so lazy
a white black and red moitie capsule i made for an anon in the last thread we had
i made this based on my wardrobe please excuse the green dots  i was trying to work out what to buy
requesting a gothic metamorphose only capsule wardrobe preferably older meta as its my favorite screen prints are okay but no prints otherwise thanks
requesting a gothic wardrobe w/o religious symbolism
  2nding this
could someone start a lolita wardrobe with this idea if im new to the fashion and am looking to have a smallish wardrobe
  what style you silly doughnut
  i think if you like multiple stylestry to create minicapsules within your wardrobe the left side of your collage is a good example of that but i feel like youre struggling more with the righthand side of your wardrobe as that is the less cohesive part of it with the iw sailor dress  if it has brass or gold buttons then the tan or some of the gold items might go well with it and you would only be looking for the right legwear and headwear as opposed to another pair of shoes another bag etc
i really like casual ones i found these in one of the previous threads i think    requesting more casual wardrobes especially with gothic or pirate influences im going to try to make one that includes a few trousers
  nayrt but this is so good anon i dont even have jane marple but now im considering owning a few
  
  omfg where is that teddy from i need him in my life
  classic is the style i feel im drawn to the most sorry i forgot to specify i dont want to ask you to spoonfeed me a wardrobe but at the same time im not sure where to start i already know i dont want a huge wardrobe with 40 main pieces but how can i have a relatively cohesive wardrobe while staying under 15 or so
i really like these threads but i feel like interest has been lacking lately when it comes to jfashion threads in general    can we combine this thread with making several coords with the same mainpiece i saved pic related from a previous thread idk if there was more     what do you think of using black with a mainpiece that doesnt have any black
  its the meta jewel leopard bag
  you shouldnt have a problem theres a great post on fyeahlolita about capsule wardrobes you should check out    i think it can be cute especially with solids black is a neutral so there arent many things it doesnt go with
 requesting leopard print some otome dresses  pieces are fine
  jewel leopard was up on closet child
  theres a great post on fyeahlolita about capsule wardrobes you should check out  thanks ill go find it now
  blacks and white can always be added as long as its balanced
  oh man capsule wardrobes are totally my jam so prepare for a ramble first of all yes capsule wardrobe principles are super great for building a small lolita wardrobe these are my thoughts on building a good lolita capsule and im second the fyeahlolita post as being a fabulous starting point    1 every item should go with at least two other items ie for each skirt you have at least two blouses that match two pairs of shoes etc and each cardigan should go with at least two main pieces  2 you need to have some statement pieces otherwise your wardrobe will feel repetitive and boring in the pic attached the apron bustier and capelet are those pieces they add a lot to coordinates without being too big/expensive and though theyre very distinctive in style they still match with most items similarly the green floral piece also gives this wardrobe a bit more dimension than if it had been another primarily cream/brown piece  3 its easier and cheaper and takes less storage space to have lots of different accessories especially legwear and headwear to change up a look than it is to have lots of dresses  4 dont neglect the shoes and bags with how the style is these days you cant really do what fyeahlolita suggests and just have one of each that matches everything  5 try not to double up except in neutral or dominant colours if youre a sweet lolita by all means have three different white blouses and if your wardrobe has a lot of pink accents having four different pink outerwear options can worthwhile but in the example wardrobe attached it would not be very useful to add lots of green things to match the jsk or wine things to match the skirt in fact i didnt do it at all  having made point 5 though its sometimes tricky to balance between it and point three you needs interesting but still useful
  ilu anon  im obsessed with capsule wardrobes as well gonna have to make one out of mine for my trip this year
  thanks so much anon youre the greatest im actually very happy i found this thread before starting a wardrobe because i wouldnt have had any idea of where to start    what are some good statement pieces i should look out for when starting a wardrobe besides caplets and shrugs that apron is adorable btw would you know the name of it
requesting aatp x moitie in black and red hues as kittle as possible whites please
  i think in those coords they should not have added black but brown
  moitie blue with brown  thats like reinventing the wheel
  i mean look at those coords its supposed to be balanced
  i think anon is one of those creative permaitas
  capsules are life totally do it i ended up with a black x berry print capsule in my wardrobe entirely by accident lol      youre so welcome i love doing this stuff if you want to tell me a bit more about exactly what style/colours/prints youre into i can do up an example capsule for you if youd like though i have some looong thoughts coming in my next post here about the specific things id have in a small wardrobe prepare yourself    as for the statement pieces it could be things like a dramatic hat or bonnet think triple fortune style or some kind of not entirely practical outer layer like in that earlier example in my own wardrobe its fawn fur i have waaaay too many fawn fur itemsthey arent necessary but they do add an interesting touch when used its just items that cant be used all the time/arent as versatile but can really elevate outfits i know thats vague but i hope it helps a bit    not sure of the apron name sorry but its from innocent world
  as promised threatened more thoughts for you    also if anyone wants to debate my opinions i am so down for that so in your case lets say you want to have a 10 main piece wardrobe you said under fifteen but tens just an easier number to work with as a rough guide id suggest the following selection of pieces this is assuming you live in a moderate temperature area so you dont need to keep things really lightweight or very layered      main pieces  1 fancy/unique main piece probably an op but maybe a jsk  4 jsks  2 ops  3 skirts    with a limited number of pieces unless you are going for a very distinctive aesthetic its best to vary the materials and cuts of your pieces have a mix of solids prints and patterned pieces try to have more than just plain cotton/cottonblend materials chiffon velvet jacquard satin all look very different and if you vary the fabrics you could have a monochrome wardrobe that still looks diverse go for different cuts if you can as well different bodice shapes and heights as well as different skirt types bustled tiered plain    post 1 of 
  post 2 of     tops    1 statement blouse or bolero try for an very unusual colour/cut or a pattern thats more uncommon than horizontal stripes  4 long sleeved blouses or cutsews 2 in the neutral colours of your wardrobe and 2 to add variety  4 short sleeved blouses or cutsews same distribution  3 long sleeve boleros or cardigans 1 neutral 2 not  3 short sleeve boleros or cardigans ditto  2 heavier coats/jackets both neutral    when im talking neutrals it generally means white for sweet ivory for classic and black for gothic in addition your wardrobe will generally have as second neutral colour depending on your chosen main pieces these secondary neutrals are often pink for sweet brown for classic and i guess white or red for gothic i dont gothic very well like with the main pieces go for a variety here as well sleeve length is the one ive mentioned because its the most obvious but things like different collar shapes materials and even patterns or prints can play in here having even a single printed cutsew can really open you up to different vibes and theres a big difference between a chiffon blouse and a cotton one    headwear  2 pieces of large headwear headbows hats headdresses veils berets to match each main piece this does not necessarily mean twenty if youre cohesive this will be more like ten items  a similar amount of smaller headwear items small flower or bow clips especially in the more unique colours of the wardrobe    the reason i mention the smaller pieces is because they are incredibly useful at bringing in cohesiveness and also filling gaps with how big and busy lolita skirts are there needs to be balance up top and ive come to find that just wearing a single large pieces up there sometimes just doesnt cut it these pieces are also super easy to buy cheaply or make yourself so i think its kind of silly to not have them
  post 3 of 4    legwear    3 pairs of tights a lace neutral a solid neutral and a patterned pair  23 pairs of ankle socks one in each of your main neutral colours  2 pairs of lolitaspecific otks to match each main piece again approximately 10  3 pairs of shoes a flat a heel and a boot minimum    honestly i love legwear socks and stockings are my thing as are shoes and it pains me to recommend having so few of these i really couldnt trim my shoes collection down much more and i have 20 lolita pairs but im trying to be moderate in my suggestions here    accessories    45 pairs of wristcuffs in the neutral and dominant colours of the wardrobe  a full set of jewellery necklace earrings bracelets rings in neutral colours  45 statement pieces    accessories is very much a personal choice kind of area me im minimal  on top of my everyday bracelets and wedding and engagement rings ill do wristcuffs and maybe a necklace an added bracelet if im feeling ott maybe a brooch ill only coordinate earrings if im feeling really fancy but some people really pile it on and it looks great so this area is very much a bare bones suggestion and i know some people will look at this and hardly call it a wardrobes worth of accessories at all    of course for all the small items headwear legwear other accessories and jewellery and yes shoes to an extent im always an advocate of having more rather than less and what i suggest above is a minimum amount rather than a maximum theyre cheaper and easier to come by or make yourself in some cases than the actual clothing items and really change up a look quite a lot
  post 4 of 4 sorry everyone  other    23 bags  2 petticoats in different volumes  23 pairs of bloomers depending on frequency of wearing lolita optional  12 miscellaneous statement pieces also optional but thinks things like capelets very dramatic shoes corsets/bustiers overdresses ott headwear    so thats my thoughts of what actual items you could have if you wanted to have a smallish lolita wardrobe thats still very versatile to me though ten main pieces is going beyond capsule to just smallish i wouldnt even call it small id call up to perhaps 7 main pieces a capsule but really more the 35 range because after that point you start bringing in more and more different colours and such so its not a true capsule in the manner of everything matching everything
requesting gothic/classic wardrobe featuring empire waisted items with full back shirring and low heel/flat shoes    i wear mostly iw and mmm and just waist dresses but i need to put my clothes in storage and build atemp wardrobe so im looking for inspo please
  whut provide examples pls
    i would probably up the number of blouses/cutsews by 2 and decrease the amount of outerwear but i am also a blouse hoarder    my reasoning is that with skirts and jsks blouse choice becomes important for your overall variety of look if youre advocating a variety of cuts of jsk then you are probably going to need different detailing on the blouses for each one  eg underbust jsk front ruffles/bib  good vs the standard atelier pierrot corset jsk often best with the roundneck ruffled princess sleeve blouse vs round neck/collared jsk high collar less front ruffles vs standard straight neckline with shoulder straps more versatile but often paired with the peter pan collar obviously some will double up being your neutral blouses for both skirts/jsks but itll be tricky to keep variety for a 10mainpiece wardrobe with only 8 blouse options     regarding socks/tights  i definitely feel that as a more inexpensive part of the wardrobe you could do things like neutral lace tights can be worn over the top of solidcolour tights in wardrobe colours which might increase your number of solid tights to 34 but increase your coording options further if you are balancing blouse/accessory colour with tights colour and need more colour than neutral
  if you want to tell me a bit more about exactly what style/colours/prints youre into i can do up an example capsule for you if youd like  thank you so much anon i actually dont own any dresses because i get so overwhelmed looking through them but i prefer the classic look and i guess i would probably end up gravitating towards country when i decide on what dresses to buy i like vm a lot though and iw mm is gorgeous but their dresses seem so expensive when i look through lace market    sorry that im not more detailed anon but ive read through all your posts and its given me a lot more to focus in on when im searching through different main pieces      the reason i mention the smaller pieces is because they are incredibly useful at bringing in cohesiveness and also filling gaps with how big and busy lolita skirts are there needs to be balance up top and ive come to find that just wearing a single large pieces up there sometimes just doesnt cut it  could you post an example of a smaller piece for say classic and sweet      dont be sorry these posts were beyond informative and taught me a ton about things i didnt necessarily think about when i was looking into lolita like different materials and varied collar shapes    5 main pieces is perfect for what i was wanting enough to wear to meets every month and even to cons when i heard people talking about how they have 40 main pieces i started feeling like i would fall into a trap of needing to spend all my money on main pieces and end up sol when it comes to everything else just to feel like im actually getting into the fashion
  you make a good point on the blouse/outerwear ratio im a hoarder of both lol but also tend to often wear jsks without a blouse but with a bolero so i probably do skew a little heavily towards outerwear    also good point with the legwear  id forgotten about layering as an option its one f those things where i know i have too many pairs of socks and tights so when i try to go minimal i possibly go too far      youre very welcome so if you like country/classic im thinking florals and gingham is that about right what colours do you like id be thinking red/wine/pink and brown/cream  is that okay by you ill definitely do you up and example capsule this week    a smaller hair accessory would generally be smaller bow clips small flower pins that sort of thing pic related is from my wardrobe post two years ago showing some of my bigger clips/flowers and then the small stuff at the bottom it gives good varietyi also have a crapton of berets and stuff and like to wear a big headwear option then decorate with a couple of smaller bits
  and i dropped my pic like a dolt
      its good advice but rather than throwing out arbitrary numbers a wardrobe lolita or capsule or whatever should be driven by its purpose/what you want to wear it to modified by things like the weather practicality your body type your preference and skintone    so for eg if you live someplace warm you can rule out velvet dresses immediately if you want maximum coording options dont buy ops jsks are more versatile if youll only be attending fancier lolita meets rule out plainer dresses if you wont wear skirts dont buy skirts if you always have issues with bust fit only buy skirts and invest in a handful of different bustiers/vests to coord with     same story with the girls who own 40 main pieces either theyre collectors and their wardrobe is big because its driven by the purpose to collect beautiful pieces or theyre daily lolitas  10 dresses coorded 3 ways each will give you 30 coords which is a month now you have to repeat all 30 coords 12 times to get a years worth of outfits or you could simply buy more dresses for more coords    if you dont already know whether you like skirts or dresses more or youre unsure of your style or what pieces look like on you just be prepared to buy and sell some items that dont work and if the whole wardrobe doesnt work sit down and rethink it again starting with its purpose youll at least have better data on what suits/doesnt suit your body and your weather after trying a few things on dont make a plan and then die sticking to it dont waste your wardrobe space trying to force a piece that doesnt work
  id be thinking red/wine/pink and brown/cream  is that okay by you  yes thats exactly what i had in mind i like yellow too but i dont see it very often in many coords besides ivory which isnt actually yellow    thank you for the image as well that gives me a better idea of the smaller accessories      this is also extremely helpful anon thank you i hadnt really thought about my purpose besides i want to be able to attend meets and involve myself in the community but i dont want a very large wardrobe because i already have several other expensive hobbies im southern and i do dress a bit more traditionally so classic/country is the style i gravitated towards the most it gets pretty hot so i dont know if i would layer legwear very often and like you said velvet would probably only work in the dead of winter when it gets under 60 here    i definitely needed to read a lot of this before diving into the fandom i just got a bit excited because i finally have the means to actually indulge myself now
  fandom  its a fashion
  which one
    actually lolita fandom is/was a thing but nobody really uses the term these days its for people who do not wear lolita themselves which is different from lolita at heart for example yoh who draws lolitas because he loves how it looks but doesnt have any interest in wearing the brands
  admittedly ive never heard of that usage but even if that is/was a thing the way anon used the term is still incorrect
  yeah i know ive only seen it 10 years ago and in a book that teaches you how to draw lolitas
  in a book that teaches you how to draw lolitas  that doesnt seem like a legitimate source whatsoever
  it has japanese artist in it including yoh and kira imai
as in them explaining it  
  when we were still on egl people who didnt wear lolita themselves were posting their lolita fanart all over the place they sometimes even contributed with translations or scans those people couldnt say they were lolitas because they didnt wear it but they could consider themselves part of lolita fandom i think we didnt use lolita at heart yet back then
  you mean gothic lolita punk the book with the interview with dj sisen who claimed that he supposedly popularized lolita fashion styles other than gothic lolita and made them more accessible to the public still dubious as hell
anyone here with a larger wardrobe using sets of modules or minicapsules im curious to know how you organize jewelry and accessories in that system     do have a neutral accessory set that works for everything  limit modules to statement pieces or does each module have a ton of themed accessory options
  sorry anon i guess i meant community but ive always thought communities were called fandoms
  you need to reread that book lol that is not what he said but he did put a lot of effort into the early gothic/alt scene in japan and organised events
  i dont really think this is a capsule wardrobe its more of a themed wardrobe none of the stuff is cohesive with each other and youve only got 3 blouses for like 5 main pieces
  coolio will get you a capsule sometime this week then obviously itll just be my opinion but hopefully it will give you some ideas      as a black x pink and a cat lover this is fabulous
  haha yeah youre right i just think its really cute  ill post some hopefully better ones    i know right cat prints are the best
  this is cute
requesting capsule wardrobe for tartan main pieces no skirts
what about a mori capsule wardrobe id definitely like to see one
  hnnnngh  this is so good but the short jj green bolero only matches 1 item the baby highwaisted skirt  thats not what you guys mean by a statement piece right even a statement piece should match more than 1 item
could i request a sax/pink/red wardrobe with accents of white especially with similar simple/oldschoolish jsks like the blue one in the op
  i took this in a sweet direction but if you dont mind a more goth/punk/rokku flavour algonquins and super lovers have done a number of leopard print dresses that would work better in a goth/rock style
  i love you thats awesome where is that skirt from with the baby leopards at the bottom
hey all i wanted to share a concept capsule wardrobe im working on the idea is brand items that can be worn to the office and then easily converted into a fully lolita outfit for the evening its inspired by some of moities new items on wunderwelt fleur which outright suggest wearing to your day job it started out with the intent to convert into gothic but some things dont quite fit gothic strictly and reflect my personal style  i know a lot of girls do something similar with classic im a mostly sweet lolita and dont like classic but i like gothic and have been wanting to start wearing moitie and other gothic items my workplace doesnt have a strict dresscode but its somewhat conservative full of old white guys my outfits are always received well so i think i have a good idea of what works during the day i want to be able to easily change my outfit at night without putting together a whole new one just switching out/adding some elements    the items on the left are ones that i feel can be worn for a toned down office look and right items are the ones to be swapped in later to make it lolita the toned down office items would be worn mostly with black or other color solid tights normie boots no hair accessories etc sometimes for the office the blouse could be a solid sweater with a jsk or skirt or lolita blouse and cardigan with normie skirt but i think any combo of these items is office appropriate let me know what you think and any suggestions
nameless poem even though i know most of /cgl/ hates it is one of my alltime dream dresses and has me wanting to make a capsule wardrobe of mostly christian/catholic themed dresses does anyone have any suggestions or inspo      nice anon are you a daily lolita then if youre wearing outfits to the office whats the name of that velveteen skirt
  shirley temple
requesting a pirate wardrobe with possibility of casual coords
  im working on something similar atm and i think youre well on your way with this cardigans and sweaters are great for making coords appear more casual or officeappropriate whereas head accessories and printed or lacy socks/tights quickly take a coord into a less normie more altfashion direction i love the pieces you picked and would totally wear them to work too      bottom left looks like vms laceup royal skirt and the one next to it is vms velveteen crown trump skirt
  thanks i dont wear it daily at one point i would wear it 23 days per week but not anymore  as ive gotten a better salary ive had more to spend on higher quality work clothing and i wanted to incorporate more burando into my office attire i probably wouldnt wear it daily but i think i could get back to wearing it more casually more often as much as i want to wear it more often creating a new outfit after work is a lot of mental energy and i think being able to transfer items from work to evening will help i do that already just not with lolita like ill keep wearing the same tights and shirt but after work switch to an edgier skirt and shoes  other anon identified the items correctly i mostly just picked the first black skirts i liked i have the crown skirt already    id love to see some of your ideas if you dont mind posting thank you for the encouragement
  there are a bunch of crosses in this
  a bunch  anonthere is one
  nayrt but the choker on the top left necklace at the top right socks on the bottom right and the long sleeved op all have crosses maybe the wristcuffs on the bottom left but i cant really tell but its still pretty easy to ignore/replace those items
  i like nameless poem too anon    moitie has really great pieces with christian imagery of course atelier boz and several other brands in fact most of them have several nuninspired pieces as well     even ap has lots of religiousthemed dresses picrelated assuming youre wanting more gothic pieces because of nameless poem though
  pastel catholic i love it
  miho matsuda has a new nun release
  i had no idea ap had so many pieces with cross motifs saving for inspo thank you    that filename  my heart
  capsule complete i have some thoughts about it what were good choices and what werent but im tired so ill share those tomorrow
      anon that made the request here thank you guys
  i wasnt sure if this is what you meant as i threw in some rather satanic/antichristian things in there because thats what im into myself   glad you like it
  so yeah a few notes and issues in case you actually use this capsule as a guide first of all some of the pinks in particular but also the wines dont really match  make sure you get things that do match in real life i also had trouble finding a yellow piece that would work everything i could think of was too sweet    on the items themselves the short sleeved pink cutsew would probably have best been a wine or a brown short sleeve blouse or cutsew instead since we have the pink short sleeve bolero as well another brown outerwear option probably a cardigan would have been very useful a couple of further options in both legwear and headwear would be good to have as well also the bags i chose werent sufficiently neutral should have subbed the floral one for an ivory one and id underestimated the amount of pink in this wardrobe  a pair of dusty pink shoes would have been really helpful    in terms of the whole statement pieces thing there are effectively four things one is the green floral jsk  it adds a new colour while still matching with each of the other colours in the wardrobe ivory/brown/wine/pink the other is the plaid skirt/jacket combo the jacket isnt the most versatile thing on its own but worn together those pieces are very bold another is the bonnet as it ups the ott factor when used but its not really an everyday piece the last statement piece is the matching headband and tights for the anette jsk when worn with the main piece you have practically a full set and though you can use them with other main pieces they are less versatile than other headwear and legwear options    i mean its not a bad capsule and you can definitely get 56 pretty different outfits for each main piece but just wanted to make those points in case you actually used this as a basis for your lolita wardrobe
  what substyle are you wanting anon id really like to make this
can someone make a military lolita capsule iid really appreciate it
  my wardrobe has sortof organically organised itself into vague capsules just based on the things that i like and tend to buy  generally for accessories/jewellery i have found it easiest to have both neutral and specific sets for each theme or colour this is a representative sample of how i accessorize the cat dresses in my wardrobe total main item count is 35 dresses/5 skirts and although it looks like there are a couple of items there that only match one dress they all match at least one other item in my wardrobe
  any preference for colorways/substyle anon
  black navy sweet
  okay looking at stuffdo you prefer solids or prints or dont care
    just pretend that all the reds match that you only ever want to wear hats and that i didnt go overboard by including both navy and black colorways along with red/wine/white ones too instead of just settling on navy or black
  ill happily wear any substyle to feed my love of tartan
    god bless you anon  this is my birthday month too and i have a good place to start a nice capsule lolita wardrobe     i will keep a look out for the substitutions you listed in the notes dusky pink shoes i dont see often but ill look through lolibrary and see if i can find some thanks so much for including such a thorough run down of combinations
  you are very welcome i hope you enjoy building your lolita wardrobe
  do you have sauce on those green oxford heels theyre so cute
  they are from forever21 i saw some similar ones from chelsea crew though
  i like these
nonprint classic capsule i would prefer ops and darker cold colours 3
  ive been attempting this for a few days and trying to get matching tartans for a capsule is actually proving quite difficultif youre still around anon do you want something you can potentially buy or is a full on imagine these are available wardrobe ok
  what are some good statement pieces i should look out for when starting a wardrobe besides caplets and shrugs  ntayrt but statement necklaces i usually wear smaller necklaces with lolita but a big fancy necklace can really add interest to a plain bodice interesting printed legwear bonnets fancy gloves
since polyvore is dead what do people use to make these
give me something as ita as possible i want to watch the world burn
can i request a larme capsule i have been quickly transitioning my wardrobe but inspiration is always wanted   black pink and white/black plaid please
  i really like this i feel like after i got my dream dress aatps sweet devil i only like main pieces rather than reaaaaally love them ive been downsizing my wardrobe like crazy but i def dont wanna touch my lolita wardrobe this is a great springboard thank you
  this is really cute but i dont see a whole lot of crossover between each of the dresses/styles maybe two to show the blousewear
a berry coord from an older thread    let me know if youd rather not see older content ill be working on some new ones as well
  best
  this is wonderful anon thank you    im gonna be sick
  i was not expecting anyone to take my request seriously you have my internets
  just to check what kind of larme are you looking at im assuming love phermone/fetish based off your colorways
i always flip flop between capsule wardrobes and just having a wardrobe that has dresses from every style this thread makes me regret not sticking with one style
  theres plaid details on the jacket but it doesnt show up here
  nayrt and i know you tried but this doesnt look very good
  different anon i wouldnt mind having a go at this larme capsule once i get home today well see if it turns out better or worse
requesting a nanchatte capsule please
  i love this would wear and be berry berry cute everyday i look forward to seeing the other capsules you make
  where is that choker from
  goddamnit anon ive been eyeing up that plaid skirt set and seeing how nice the jacket looks alone with other classic coords make me want to buy it even more        first of all some of the pinks in particular but also the wines dont really match  wanted to jump in here in case anon really does end up using it i actually own the btssb antique ribbon shoes in wine ap logo socks in wine annette tights and a 2018 iw burgundy bonnet im guessing has the same base fabric as the one pictured all of the reds match except for the colour of the strawberries on the tights which are obviously lighter the shoes and otks are pretty much the same colour socks only a tiny bit lighter and while the bonnet is a bit darker its not noticeable when worn since the shadow your skirt casts on your legwear makes them look like they match
  this is so cute speaking as someone with a black/red/white berry subsection to her wardrobe      dont regret it if you love it wear it and if it is a whole bunch of different things then so be it       buy buy buy if id fit it i would i love both the skirt and the jacket and together they are sublime thanks for the input on the wines as well glad to know i wasnt off for at least some of them
  if youre struggling a full on dream wardrobe is okay i could always hunt for similar items thanks so much for doing this
there are so many dresses its hard to focus on where to start i see why so many lolitas have huge wardrobes now
requesting a rabbit themed capsule wardrobe pls
  the easiest way is to simply start pick out a main piece that you like and build a coord around it then next time you buy a main piece try to find one that appeals to you and works with the pieces you have it takes a while if youre on a budget and does require you to rein yourself in and not throw money at anything that catches your eye but if your goal is to build a functional wardrobe this is the best way to do it at least in my view
  its missing a normie office blouse    seconded i only know the rabbit jsk from diamond honey
  needs herobology and lots of iw bunnies
  do you want more classic style or sugary sweet or something in between
  maybe less fuzzy and chiffon love the plaid and bow details though im in a creative field but still need to look presentable for corporates maybe avoid anything that looks like a nightgown lol
would anyone have any inspiration for a 1920s/30s style wardrobe with a sort of 30s girl detective/journalist look im really warming to greens blues jewel tones etc with a feminine but practical look
  how is this jfashion related
  im assuming they mean classic lolita with 20s/30sinspired details
  yes sorry i completely dropped that part classic lolita
  dont know if youre still there anon but i made a blackxpink tartan ap wardrobe
  nayrt but i am obsessed with bunnies and even own bunnies and i would love to see a mature/classic lolita bunny themed/inspired wardrobe
  something in between please
  i have bunnies too how many do you have anon
requesting some brown and blue inspo pref classic/otome/gothic no sweet   ive seen some lovely navy/brown normie outfits but im hitting a roadblock trying to balance it in a lolita wardrobe
  can you provide an example of a navyxbrown coord you like anon
requesting a wardrobe that is anons interpretations of the essence of old school lolita this can include famous old school pieces ie babys elizabeth op metas velveteen triple frill op or other pieces that you feel are definitive of the style like ops or blouses with detachable sleeves solid jsks with torchon lace etc    would really like to see different anons interpretations of this
ive seen people use latex too but then it looks a bit too fetishy to me
a rare no crossplay cat noir
  he kinda looks like michael cera to me but the costumes and photo look good
    shes so cute holy fuck      their costumes are great and she is also a qt only thing that stops it from being perfect is the lack of shine on ladybugs suit      where as this is way too much shine and shoop and honestly does look like fetish shit kinda funny that the most asian looking girl is my least favorite ladybug posted so far    also sharing a volpina i think looks great hopefully season 2 will give us aome more cosplay variety
  yeah the latex ladybug wasnt so great but i think her casual marrinette look is good
  i think this one looks ok though
  not bad but maybe they should try styling the wig a bit more
  latex too but then it looks a bit too fetishy to me  it is just a material why worry about fetish looks and in any case you have a mask and it is not as if people should identify the player with any character as if all catwoman players were thieves
  latex works fine for ladybug as long as its not shiny
  what are you even trying to say so incoherant    anyway heres another ladybug cosplay
  why does marienette look asian to you or do you just think asian girls are better
  shes canonically half chinese have you ever watched the show
  character is literally half asian  why do you think she should be asian huh
  anon pls im fucking screaming holy shit im crying literal tears while cackling at this you fucking legend
 the suit is fine but god the wig is so awful i hate how you can see her hair line
  wasnt it obvious it is just a material just use it when you want and dont worry what others think    anyways why is cgl hung up on this yet the occasional lewd threads clearly show people here are willing to be kinky
  lmao i swear i wasnt trying to be mean or anything but the resemblance is so uncanny    speaking of cat noir cosplayers i never see ones do the green eye lenses on the mask
  i think with some tailoring around the neck and upper arms it would look much better it would be a perfect ladybug suit if it had the honeycomb overlay of this suit      but yeah i agree that the wig ruins it i like this one i just posted a lot too
there is surprsing amount of boys cosplaying chat nowadays all seem to be gay though not a critique just an observation
  well he is super popular on the yaoi and cute male boards so it makes sense
  there is surprsing amount of boys cosplaying chat nowadays  at this stage it is a surprise any guy does the cat   all seem to be gay though  oh
  fucking faggot looks like bruno
  if she had been french her name would have been marinade obviously
ignore trolls post cosplay
  that is adorable      annnddd im officially gay for a catboi
  then you shall burn at the stake
this series seems really creepy to me
  why because of the fetish fuel poured on the flames of lust for the cat
  tas oublié de prendre tes médocs gérard
    any of the villains
  if she had been obese then her name would be marinade
  i normally hate print suits  why seems like a legitimate tool to achieve an effect  but this one actually looks pretty cool and it has a shiny honeycomb pattern overlay  agreed  that i have no idea how to mimic  what alternatives to print are there realistically and looking closely on the picture it seems it is not quite a hexagonal pattern
  oof
wasnt pic related going to make a new outfit    i had thought ladybug would be popular for cosplay with season 2 going but not much so far
  jesus the spots and neck are so fucked
how picky is the fandom about chat noirs eyes being green im a guy that wants to cosplay chat noir but i cant wear contacts because of an eye injury the photographer i work with is good at editing eye color so itll look accurate in photos but will i get shit for wearing him around the convention without green contacts my eyes are naturally dark brown
  there are many issues with the suit but the pose hits the nail in any case she did say she was going to make a new suit and i hope she does
  i think for the most part people wont care i see a lot of people skipping out on the contacts portion of a cosplay and people dont seem to mind
  same pair
  i like the suits but marinettes hair feels really choppy
  pose hits the nail  thats one of the most basic poses that ladybugs do
  this cosplayer designed the print and worked with a print company to create that effect on the fabric it cost shit tonnes
  yet few do it    i like cosplay that goes into the role rather than say sporting a daring outfit
  why should print be so expensive i see others are making their patterns available for a more reasonable sum
  maybe youre not looking in the right places because ive seen plenty of ladybugs that strike a fighting pose
villains 
okay i like nathaniel kurzberg
perfect to group cosplay
well 3
  that effect on the fabric  seems antibug here  has a printed fabric can it really be that expensive
      its not just a pattern printed on the hexagons are a 3d overlay on top of the fabric i have a close up photo of the fabric but its a zoomed in pic of her butt and i dont want to russle jimmies
  anyone idea where i can buy a evillustrator cosplay 
  is it bad that i recognize that cosplayer just by looking at his nose  didnt know these two cosplayed ladybug huh
  the hexagons are a 3d overlay on top of the fabric  is that necessary i have seen prints that are just prints and not overlays  i have a close up photo of the fabric but its a zoomed in pic of her butt and i dont want to russle jimmies  why not just crop the image
  why do fans like nathanial so much hes a total cuck
  chloe and evilistrator look good but what the fuck is that hideous attempt at ladybug
  hes a total cuck  nathaniel look great and he has an interesting character when you look behind his shyness the design also looks great overall that makes him attractive and he can draw   what is a cuck 
   he seems like a character nice guy losers self insert into because hes a boring nobody with a crush on a girl who will never give him the time of day hes total shit compared to adrien and isnt even a contendor to win marrinettes affections he gets overshadowed by nearly every other male character and is virtually non existant compared to the other supporting cast the only reason people seem to like him is because of of his character design he gets more attention than even nino who is a way more prominent and interesting character   tldr  he a cuck because he is vastly inferior to adrien boring even among secondary characters and only liked because people think he looks cute
  i know its weird but girls like guys who are polite and sensitive and artistic
  thats what i like about adrien i mentioned several times that nathaniel is boring to me not every girl likes the dull friendzoned nice guy type loser gets akumatized because marinnette wont fuck him
new miraculous more cosplay to come 
new miraculous appearing in this weeks episode
  its alya right
  yes very much so 
  how picky is the fandom about chat noirs eyes being green im a guy that wants to cosplay chat noir but i cant wear contacts because of an eye injury    be one of the first ones to try out a clear green plastic overlay in his mask
  more details have come to light pic related strangely not many cosplay projects for this one even though a well placed zipper should make things easier
  because people liked volpinas version more probably
  dat ass    if i didnt have such a big belly these tight suits would look good on me ive got nice thighs
  any photo of her vgg    i guess cameltoes would be visible
  she is a nsfw model finding what you are looking for is just a question of making an effort
girls with big assets cosplaying whats supposed to be child cartoon characters ending up in sexualizing them    i like this
hexagonal patterns seem to be all the rage and here someone has been able to get patterned latex sheets seems to be andromeda latex so it is probably not cheap
  i was going to but my sister had ladybug and we figured it would be too awkward  spoilers we wouldve been fine and i should do it one day
  which is a problem why
  what is a cuck   someone who gets cuckblocked
  not being a fetlord
  still hoping she will return    also when is next episode
  i really wanna see a reflekta cosplay
  not every girl likes the dull friendzoned nice guy type  uh what girl does lol
  i hear loads of money can help
for a cat noir bodysuit should i use stretch pleather vinyl or latex
  grill then latex
  boy
  whatever you do go for matte     personally not latex cause it doesnt breathe and needs lube to slip it on skin     pleather comes in many weights so you might find something thin enough to wear but thick enough to have substance to it     vinyl also varies a lot
  boy  leather perhaps start with a leather motorcycle suit
  personally not latex cause it doesnt breathe and needs lube to slip it on skin  is that really a problem actors have worn it for movies for ages with no ill effects
  that picture    fucking thot shes disturbing a kids show with that goddamn whores will take any cosplay with tight bodysuit just to whore around
  she is the same as in  and  and also  not showing more skin than an average girl in bikini as for kids show well the fetish fuel is already notorious by us standards since it is french
  bikinis are for thots too bro its obvious plus the kids show the days where they were innocent are long gone    god i just hate sexualization
  i forget the exact story but it is indeed a problem i think it was catwoman from the newer batman trilogy had issues with fainting because her suit was so constricting they would vacuum her into her suit and shed just keel over if they filmed too long
  nah thats not the new trilogy thats the classic tim burton one it was michelle pfieffer or however you spell her name
  god i just hate sexualization  what part of its a french show and it was sexy to begin with because its a french show do you not understand fuck off and die
  lets not forget yvonne decarlo as batgirl in the 60s batman live action show    back then latex and rubber garments were not as advanced she had trouble wearing her batgirl costume
instagram dive of some nonprotag cosplays be warned its mostly selfies out there
  i dont watch kids shows bro nor did i know french shows had sexualization
  this might be the third one from the same group but i like their production and consistent quality
  youre psychotic sounding you dont care about kids you just want to sperg out on a hot girl because youre insecure and pathetic she isnt even in full cosplay hence she isnt sexualizing the character
  t fatty with low tier face genetics
    i admit i made these posts while on a psychotic frenzy i had this weekend truly she is not sexualizing the character and i rationally have no reasons to say anything about her or her cosplay    i apologize
  we love you anon take care we can all have a bad day enjoy therefore another ladybug cosplay
  these are dudes right
  joking she is a well known nsfw model whose textile coverage normally is so minimal that there simply cannot be any doubt about her anatomy
let us not forget this right what are your plans
  psychotic frenzy  huh who knew always thought the people who would rant about that stuff were right time to reevaluate i guess
what are your guys thoughts on masks like painted on vs a solid mask and eye black/red vs no paint around the eyes     its a constant struggle because a solid mask gets rid of any facial articulation around the eyes so it makes you look not very expressive but i think it also looks better than painted on naturally
     the cuter and more obviously feminine a female is the more desperately trapfags will try to say shes a male because they like to delude themselves into thinking real life traps look just like their hentais   imagine looking at that face and that hip to waist ration and saying dude no one in their right mind would
just throwing out some info about the group of miraculous cosplayers they were part of some cmvs by 86th floor music you should check them out they had a bigger cast recently for the latest video they shot which involved the sabrina you saw     heres some of the instagrams if anyone wants them     86thfloormusic  marinette luminara_cosplay  adrien rascalrabbit_cosplay  alya savanahwilddd  chloe hildaglitz  sabrina rhilentless  mylene freakycosplay  nathalie nebulardisk
    next episode will be in smarch
blonde guys in latex running around conventions  bless the french
  alll righty then
  you are welcome i will be one of them
  not to shit in your cheerios but if you arent outright twink youll just look like a child predator saw a noir at akai in nashville that looked like hed just walked out of a rugby match was not a good look
  might be worth posting in a horror thread
  luckily i am a twink
  why
  why not
  pics
anyone planning more ladybug cosplay or has the break made people drop it      she seems to have dropped off the net twitter account is deleted
  yes on occasion guys do cat like me some friends were big into miraculous and when they heard i had martial arts training with a bo staff they asked me to be their cat for a skit sadly i moved away before that got off the ground but my gf is a fan and its on our to do list for some indeterminate point in the future
  she seems to have dropped off the net  she is on instagram instead
  shadman
  
god damnit the new episode leaked but the system wont let me post a link
  goo dot gl slash gaot53 please 4chan let me post this
  there we go a lot of adrinette in this one maybe plot progression kind of
  plot progression kind of  not really unless you count the rather mysterious last scene    more people are preparing for the yet unaired queen bee
  im really excited about that one because im a sucker for antagonist turned reluctant ally types like mandy in totally spies
  i thought she was half vietnamese
  no shes half chinese
why not more love for kagami    also 
  because she is a one off character thats a blatant bootleg of ladybug to serve as potential love interest for adrien that never actually goes anywhere
  i wanna suck off a cute chat noir
  what a shitty cosplay
  she is supposed to return  in season 3 i had expected more especially as they have stated making models are really expensive those scary eye brows suggest this was a hasty model too queen bee is far more popular and she hasnt even been aired      it was the only one i could find and i had expected something better too the colours are there but not the texture or even the collar      i think that is part of the conspiracy of this series
someone is really going to town on this cosplay 
  not to be that guy but youd think that if making models is really expensive theyd focus less on the monster of the week format and focus more on building yknow story  i love ladybug but man its flawed as heck
  focus more on building yknow story  season 2 is that re the balcony scene    there is also a lot of expectations for the redemption part but monsters will be with us every week it is the framing concept
  they would vacuum her into her suit  how do you even do that it should be far easier to just slide in using lube    pic is latex looks just right
  latex shouldnt have creases and wrinkles like that the suit isnt fitted properly
  just right  saggy and ill fitting  are you alright sweetie
i want to cosplay miraculous ladybug but i have no idea how to get the hexagon pattern without resorting to
  a lot of details can be found in this video 
    thanks
    what i dont like about cosplaying ladybug is that the yoyo sometimes moves to the front so it looks like you are wearing a cod piece and you have a penis
  i think you are overthinking things also just put a piece of velcro to stick the yoyo on where you want
  her face is hella scary       or a magnet a little easier to conceal
  wrong latex suits have a neutral stance where a properly fitted suit will have no wrinkles but only when you stand in exactly that stance if you move outside of the neutral stance you will get wrinkles around the joints where you moved out of stance see how the wrinkles are all around her joints
  its also baggy around the neck and wrists its also creasing around her thighs too not only joints
  i wear latex a fair bit and the suit is definitely a little big for her the bagginess on the shoulders is a big give away
  the suit shes wearing is obviously ill fitted dont be obtuse
  it depends on the thickness of the latex sheet it comes in many grades from unwieldy 1 mm to 02 mm membrane    too thick and the latex doesnt flow or conform closely to your body the picture  shows creases from twisting her arms the suit is probably a bit too large but also the latex seems too thick    if it is very thin it is very much a second skin but is also a bit fragile can also be transparent thin suits can be used in dance this video work safe is one example  the rest of the thread is nsfw and the video immediately below shows what happens when the latex is too thin the latex becomes seethrough    lube if used also affects how the latex flows over your skin
  lord why would you pick the first time i made this suit lol    i made it two more times the latest one i havent wore yet but i used yaya hans hex fabric for it here was the second one in the glory days    that first one made me cry i messed up bad but lessons were learned especially when i had no idea how to work with this fabric but cosplay is all a learning process also dont do it all in one night bruh     i rebranded myself but havent cosplayer anything really in like 2 years ill post the new suit for critiques on here sometime
  lord why would you pick the first time i made this suit lol  i liked the attitude in the pose it is not just about costume the pose or acting must match even for the best of suits    i made it two more times the latest one i havent wore yet but i used yaya hans hex fabric for it here was the second one in the glory days  i thought that was a black fabric or is there a red variant you look good please post more pics    i rebranded myself but havent cosplayer anything really in like 2 years ill post the new suit for critiques on here sometime  rebranded as in latex cosplaying
new costumes textures coming in the next episode scales rather than hex patterns and more fabric like than high gloss latex   freeze at 27 s mark    no good stills yet the producers are seemingly uninterested in promo pictures and desk top sized images
  at least they have now licensed costume manufacturers so i guess we will ser more ladybugs around
  licensed costume manufacturers  the quality leaves a bit to be desired still room for good cosplay
would it be stupid to cosplay one of the former ladybug miraculous holders i was thinking of cosplaying pic related since i dont think i would make a great marinette
  braaaaaaaaaaaap  excuse moi xd
  would it be stupid to cosplay one of the former ladybug miraculous holders  go for it variations are good or you could interpret a futuristic version ladybug 3000 perhaps    the new transform was revealed today 
  i have seen someone do this it was sort of a space suit/ cyberpunk setup sunglasses instead of a mask and she had a what i suppose was supposed to be a wrist mounted version one of those laser resin 3d printers as her lucky charm
  the closest thing i found was this   it looks cyberpunk but does not quite match what you described id be interested to see though    there is also a cybergoth interpretation pic related i thought the cybergoths had died out but some remain
new episode is out with new potentials for cosplay 
  the shine on her lips looks good
  one cosplayer used white paint and a stamp to do it herself it looked pretty labor intensive but so long as you do it before you sew the pieces together and make sure that they line up it should be a cheap way to get the same desired effect id imagine a good stamp and the right paint color would go a long way
  their faces are just perfect
  why isnt easier to stamp after sewing together that way it is easier to see the pattern lines up i would have thought    new episode with more new villains shold be appearing soon
  you are probably thinking of this video   the effect isnt really that convincing for all the effort that went into it
  honeycomb overlay    3d overlay    just how do you make such an overlay i cannot see this in any other pictures i find just printed patterns
  that actually sounds pretty cool
  thats a dye sublimation like a laser printer but for fabric which means the 3dness of the honeycombs is just some tricky shading in the file
  its definitely not as convincing as 3d printing no but for someone who doesnt have that money its a sound alternative i feel like she didnt use the fabric stamp or paint color but if someone were to put more time into that id imagine itd turn out better      i feel like itd be difficult to get an accurate stamp on the rounder edges of the costume but i dont make bodysuits so what do i know
bampu
personally i find the pattern printed suits dont really look great the look doesnt really translate well irl
  i have searched for 3d printed clothing and with some strange exceptions worn by models better known for fetish work 3d printed clothing is not available i guess ill skip posting those images    the only 3d effect is as  suggests just part of the pattern    in the future i guess you could 3d print resilient seamless clothing with whatever texture you want but that is still a while away
  yo where can i see ladybug get orange crushed    
someone cosplay this
  wtf is that anatomy why do people throw money at this hack
  youre being gross and sexualizing something that doesnt need to be
  wtf is that anatomy  what is wrong with it
  short ass arms  swole ass neck  giant thighs bigger then waist  freakishly skinny knees compared to thighs  oddly shaped breasts  breasts somehow further back than ribcage  one tit higher than the other even though the shoulders are level  box shaped head she always gives every character
  not op but youre right the left arm is a lot shorter than the right
    get these fatties with no wigs outta here
  mom bod
    the lighting makes these look like horror shots
  you forgot  doesnt know how mirrors work
  personally i find her worst sin to be really fucking boring poses and composition
  care to explain horror lighting is typically from below in these pictures the lighting is clearly from above to model
  honestly im more mad about chat noirs weird head and arms but i really dont understand why people look to sakimichan for good anatomy because no god no   she cant even mirror right     on topic i havent watched in a while when are the next eps out
  big surprise
  on topic i havent watched in a while when are the next eps out  on the 17th where adrien finds out about maris stalker shrine   
  her outfit was made out of some kind of fabric though      while i dont like the white splotches of fake shine this print is probably the closest we will get to an authentic looking suit handmaking anything better than this would be incredibly hard
  okay i nominate you
next few episodes should have lots of interesting designs    some spoilers at 
  tfw 90 sure that the original post was sarcasm
attractive women are hot
an announcement is coming up in a few days    who is going to comic con as ladybug or chat noir
  man you can see her bra through that why do newfag cosplayers still wear underwear in skinsuits they completely miss the point of it all dont they
  t low test christfag male
  people miss the point of bodysuits in general
  an announcement is coming up in a few days  it is up now      some fear the camel it was discussed earlier      go on
  but the whole point of the character is that it does look fetishy as fuck
    i always laugh to myself when i see another woman in whats supposed to be a skintight and revealing outfit suddenly get cold feet and were underwear like why even wear the suit if youre not going to at least do it right
  cameltoe is a lame excuse people who dont have the confidence to cosplay it right simply shouldnt its disgusting    is right either do it right or dont do it at all because bra and panty lines are gross and people are laughing at you
  as already mentioned it was her first try not everyone is perfect at first      cameltoe is a lame excuse  so according to /cgl/ many well known cosplayers have been escorts the model in op calls herself a lingerie model and has no problem with the camel others do
  a good idea after all didnt they outright show in one episode his mask works as night vision goggles it would probably be more accurate than the contacts honestly
    ive seen someone do it it looks terrible
  ugh i went to high school with this bitch
    how did the images and texts get deleted
  more announcements are up for comic con anyone going      has she succeeded in making modelling as her some career      i wondered the same can we get at least some images back she was fully clothed and no camel in sight i dont understand what rule was used to wipe these especially in view of comments like  and 
news coming out from comic con including previews/spoilers          next episode has a trailer out 
the global promo is out and it shows chloe with pollen probably the first animation with pollen      also trailer for s2e18 is out      i had expected more cosplay including the aqua ladybug outfit
      its possible they just disappeared due to how old the original post was
august is here and the broadcasts are starting again 6th august seems to be frozer with a skating themed outfit for the akumatised as well as ladybug and chat noir   old preview 
  threads on this board arent meant to stay alive for this many months after a while weird things start to happen
sdcc had plenty of ladybug cosplay here is some coverage  part 1   part 2  and  part 3     we are finally getting a good look at the next episode style queen   cosplaying that will take a lot of gold
  just start a new thread this one is too old and doesnt even have an op anymore
  this one has the continuity and the information and is nowhere near falling off yet starting a new thread will just bring up a lot of complains about one thread was killed because of this as usual
  nah you cant even tell what thread this is in the catalogue
  huh just got this fabric for lb good to know it looks alright
  how the fuck do you make bokeh like this
why wont you all let this thread die and just make a new one people cant even tell wtf this is since op is broken
  fast lens and neutral density filter to prevent overexposure from the full daylight
    glad i could help anon
  please post pics at least of the fabric it looks strange in  like too small hexagons     and what is the fabric it looks a bit inelastic
  thats not true at all is it
  its red dot spandex from spandexworld sorry if the swatch was a little mangled i was pouring silicone over it to make a texture stamp for the mask
  there is so much latex in media music and movies that if there had been ill effects we would have heard of it the ladybug movie is coming closer and i expect the actors to wear latex      looks nice please keep us updated
      i dont know that latex is harmful to wear but you sweat a lot its super highmaintenance and its really hard to get on its just a really tricky material to deal with
  i want to suck that alyas nose i wanna watch my fluids drip down the huge bump in the middle of her nose what do you call that anyway
live action movie set for 2019  their suits will probably be shit  life sucks
  and its really hard to get on  i have seen a video obviously not including it here where it is done in less than one minute it is easier if it is thin then again if it is thin it is also fragile      it is not an all out fetish show like totally spies but not too far behind i will be disappointed if it isnt latex
  nah its probably going to be that fake leather they use for the marvel movies or silicone   hollywood has a distinct tone to what it makes the hero suits out of and latex usually means that they are going for something dark and gritty think watchmen
thread originally made almost a year ago  man slow boards are like time capsules
      there arent any harmful physical effects the main issues stem from sweat it being the worst in a catsuit with feet because the sweat has nowhere to go and from appropriate sizing the main issue people tend to have is poorly fitting latex too tight is way too uncomfortable too loose and just looks wrong
    was it a full catsuit im sure a person whos used to dealing with latex will get it on way quicker but everything ive ever heard has said theres a pretty decent learning curve to putting on latex especially full body suits
  was it a full catsuit  yes and a neck entry catsuit last i saw the video was on youtube obviously nsfw it did require a lot of lube though not everyone considers this a problem still the latex can tear it happens even for the most experienced people    btw here is a rather elaborate cosplay short in two episodes  ep1   ep2 
    interesting thats neat then    im sure a movie would have the budget for multiple catsuits and the technicians for this sort of thing
chat noirs suit is canon leather
maybe this is a bit offtopic but i used to follow this cosplayer named kingofspandex but he seems to have just vanished from the earth did something happen with him i really enjoyed another fellow fit cosplayer
  that is one unfortunate chest
  i looked him up some photographer on twitter last posted a picture of him on october 15 and linked the instagram post in the tweet the instagram post has been deleted
  yeah he looks better in other pics to be honest mirio was one point though
  yeah searched everywhere cant find anything someone mentioned sexul harassmentwhich is ironic because from what i remember he was a vocalbelieve women and so on type and it would be hilariously ironic if he got caught doing the exact sams thing still would love to know what happened
  he got caught for sexually harassing and sending nudes to a minor and deleted everything
  oh god found a fb post too im generally skeptical of rumors and such because how men are naturally an easier target but from what ive seen and texts etc it sounds creepy af god why do people want to hookup at cons i dont get it i just wanna dress up and have fun/
looks like the coowner of metrocon decided to leave gracefully  holy shit
bwahahahahahahahaha    floriduhs most famous failcon does it again    i doubt there was anything graceful about it give it time and the dirt will start to show his swinger wife dumped him and is filing for divorce so she could fuck alex because nick was cheating with girls on his cast this con is nothing but a fireball fueled circlejerk
  oh shockingya im surprised it took this long for the blow out to be public metro has been a failing ship and there it is finally the flames are showing shit show and shit owners
i guess inspecting girls underwear wasnt enough for him anyone know what theyve got on him to make him leave because he certainly wouldnt leave and it definitely wouldnt be gracefully he was way too laid and paid to just walk away
  nick fazio more like nick fazed out
not even surprised any con that picks famous cosplayers over craftsman cosplayers for their costume contest judges has to have some shit management happening across the board
  using the word cast to describe con volunteers    the fuck is with flordia hicks that think everything is damn disney
  and bringing back said same cosplayers year after year
  even though theyre volunteers theyre in a stage show which makes them a cast but thanks for playing and they were nicks cast so he could be as touchy feely and gropey as he wanted to with the girls it was no secret that if you complained about it or didnt give him what he wanted hed change you to a nonspeaking part or make you a stage hand or kick you off the cast completely
  metro has been rinse and repeat con since nick and alex bought it every attempt to change the con has only made it worse and their pitiful attempt at making a new cashonly adult con where they could drink smoke and fuck all they wanted to failed laughably anymore they cant even lie convincingly about their failing attendance and its no secret that they have been secretly looking to move the con to orlando because the convention center is too expensive for them now
surprising fazio hasnt been arrested yet hed bang any cast member he could get drunk enough to put out regardless of her age i remember him telling one girl its not sex if it isnt in your pussy so shed give him a blow job anyone want to guess why they all wear kilts at the con
    looks like one pedo sold it to another pedo wonder how long before the truth about alex comes out
how is this con even still around tampa is the armpit of anime con drama
pretty self explanatory what are some conventions in north america that are worth travelling to or are there any cons you think are underrated and deserve more attention pic unrelated
  kamicon is the most underrated convention in american its the only con where i feel like it is actually different every year interactive story and great unique guests
  not a good enough explanation desu    ax and colossal con are worth travelling for me colossalcon because its a fun party con ax for aa panels and cosplay meet ups

the five next major events sound really sad i guess i will all see you in spring
  i know anon it saddens me too especially after the last two years where it felt as if we had good content all year round nishicon moving to late may really left a large hole on the calendar
what kind of cons do you guys want to see     i would like a horror/thriller themed con or a really campy christmas themed con 
  this is there actually any explanation why nishicon moved to may to me it seemed perfectly fine for it to be held in january/february
  imagicon used to be pretty okay right i didnt even know they still existed desu
there is also the mid winter fair in archeon 78 december 
  they had a stand at dcc right
  theaterhotel seems to have a really busy schedule and with all the other cons we have im not saying too many tomo events but too many tomo events its hard to get a date at all i guess
  horror con for sure im sad it never got to be a thing
  imagicons location is super cozy and has fancy decoration i might actually go just for the fun of it gasp
  from what i recall it used to be okay ive never been there myself tho but considering ede is nearby and the lack of other cons i might as well give them a try      fun at a convention this is an outrage
anyone who has been to imagicon before that can share some experiences i might be interested to go
  small smelly few visitors last time only 300 and a lot of older comic book guys  location is ok and very well decorated not worth the time and money imho
  but why not tomo and another con in the same month or even in the same weekend that wouldnt be a problem i think most of the people want to attend a quality con
  nope most people like it cheap quality is not a prime motivator anymore
  sadly a lot of younger cosplayers are content with conventions such as tomo they are mostly on a budget and prefer quantity over quality as long as they can do their fortnite dances while wearing a bubblegum pink wig and some cheap school uniform theyre happy its mostly the somewhat older and more serious/more skilled/etc cosplayers or people with actual standards in general who prefer nishicon in that case
what happened to dynamiccon that was held around the beginning of the year as well right
  dynamiccon was shit
tell me if im reaching but it feels like whoever drew the nishi mascotte this year blatantly drew some shitty kda akali color over   i understand using the design to get your theme across but it feels like a cheaper attempt than ex using snk jackets on a mascotte
  well thanks for the glorious answer
  its always drawn by the same person she doesnt trace its just not the most flattering style sometimes shes slowly getting more blind too i believe i think this one is at least a little better than some of the previous years
   shes slowly getting more blind too i believe  shes colorblind
    i know its not a color over but indeed the style isnt flattering it really makes it look like the artist just took an akali picture drew some more basic lineart and just added some new colors      thats pretty impressive then
so what happened with that deadpool book drama hype creations got off easy
  well the comments got disabled and it pretty much ended with that
  theyre not getting off easy i heard from a dcc insider that there will definitely be consequences im hoping its only for the host though because the rest of hc is great the volunteers are great the competition is great the owner of hc is a little less great but i can live with that because of the rest
  just because things moved out of the spotlight doesnt mean theyre getting off easy from what i know the book in question got added to the goodie bag last minute without anyone at hc having actually read it they simply trusted their teammate on this which backfired and resulted in a few people getting upset about the contents of the book hc is aware of this released a quick statement about it and things will be discussed further internally where it belongs
  i dont mean to be rude but if someone is slowly turning more blind and theyre colourblind why would you let them be in charge of your art
  lets not forget the people who are claiming that they tried to look for a hc member but couldnt find any of them backstage or at the stand there was always someone at the stand and i heard even backstage until about half a hour after the competition
  because shes also one of the organizers of nishicon and they only have a few other volunteers that change every edition      ive had a couple of periods where i couldnt find a hc crewmember personally
  because shes also one of the organizers of nishicon and they only have a few other volunteers that change every edition    i can kinda get that but surely theres someone that might be a better fit than her even if its just for a couple of bucks
  its probably pride desu
  every public their own event right    ive had some skilled cosplayers really look down on me for not being as skilled as them  so whats the point if those nasty ppl go to nishi and i stick with chibi hangout or jaapcon
  ive had some skilled cosplayers really look down on me for not being as skilled as them    look down on you like how exactly
dcc made a statement besides a just a oh no we are sorry they specificaly state that it means fuck all and they are going to continue working with the people that brought the book
  i wouldnt be to quick to judge if i were you anon there is just a little bit of information theyre going to keep working with hc but i can only guess that at least the host will be fired
  i hope the host gets fired its the least thing they can do
      i want everyone fired volunteers included
  did we even read the same statement dcc is publicly holding hype creations responsible for this minor fuckup and expects them to set things straight in the end all that happened was someone within hc decided on his own to hand out his poorly written book with jokes that were in poor taste its hardly the end of the world and certainly no reason to break all ties with the entire team with     also heres a link to the statement by dcc to those interested 
hc posted a statement on their own page
    i hope they will the host is currently defending himself and is blaming everyone that theyre bullies now what an idiot admit you made a mistake by not realizing this book would be offensive to a lot of people especially by giving it as a reward     way i see it hes just gonna continue hosting as hype crew member and everyone will be like oh im sorry this happened it wont happen again and no repercussions will be had
  where is he claiming everyone is a bully
black ring their dcc video is out opinions
    the most terrible way to handle something if you ask me
  terrible like always
edgy cringelord aka deadpool is fired see their page
    pretty sure this is enough right
minor community outcry takes place over some shitty book handed out at the dutch comic con cosplay competition  both dcc and hype creations decide to take full responsibility and put an end to it in a professional manner  the guy who wrote the book decides to throw oil onto the fire after things have been worked out  mfw im watching this all take place
what was in the book that was offensive
    he is just ruining it for himself with his behavior after it     i mean  is proof the community is filled with toxic whiteknighta and sjw but if he played the basic sorry card it would have blown over all they want is to win even if it just an apology
  thats why i dont understand why   is being salty and demands the entirety of volunteers gone  then again might just be a troll
deadpool cosplayers once again proving they are the worst
    true but also showing the community is toxic as fuck they see something and jump right on it but next week crying why people are mean toxic and jump to conclusions
i bet if he wrote that shit somewhere in the middle of the book no one would have noticed and this all wouldnt have happened
  sooner or later someone wouldve noticed and still comment about it
i wonder if anyone actually notices that he is actually ridiculing hitler poeple act as if he wrote there some pro nazi propoganda but he didnt sure it was a bit edgy what he wrote but people are also over exaggerating this whole thing its more like a bad joke if anything
its pretty much going to be like momokun witch hunting is in now the cosplay blacklist dude just wasnt popular enough to get the job done
  it was inappropriate either way and someone needed to be held accountable its not the first nor last time that this host would fuck something up      for sure but the whole book was incredibly stupid choice as a reward for a competition in name of an organisation such as hc or dcc
  was trolling/being sarcastic i like a great deal of them in actuality
  i guess they dont see a problem with it
  ahaha i see what you did there
honestly i read the book i have no life there is no offensive content except for the hitler reference in the foreword
  thats the thing except for we can say he tried to joke about hitler i agree that he tried but that doesnt make it less offensive that and the innapropriate/annoying behaviour during the competitions and the vulgar remarks to underaged girls is just one big pile of shit just the straw that broke the camels back
someone pinch me please did they is this for real a tomocon ad  a satan cat dressed up as sinterklaas omg
  doesnt make up for the bad writing how many days did it take you to read it and actually understand what he wrote down
  its so bad its good i cant wait for the first con to use office 2000 wordart for their advertising
  wanna hear a joke they used the same image last year its the first result if you google sinterklaas kat so they didnt even really try not like they ever use images beyond result number 5 anyway
seeing as most people in the dutch community seem to hate anyone with a decent like base i came up with a new discussion/question    what makes someone a likable cosplayer i dont want any name droppings just the characteristics of a likable cosplayer    and another question what makes you dislike a cosplayer
  what makes you like a cosplayer  them being a likable and decent human being someone who wont hesitate to help others and remains down to earth no matter how popular they get    what makes you dislike a cosplayer  them behaving like an entitled stuck up diva bitch
  to be fair its a thing ive seen happening more and more the moment a person gets a decent like base honestly whether its real or fake a lot of people immediately jump on the hatetrain and assumptions are being made rumors are being spread and whatever not and the worst thing is is that theyre often not even based on true facts or sources dutch coscom people are like sheep following the other constantly    but to answer your question and what  said i like a cosplayer who shows sincerity i dont care whether they buy or make their cosplays as long as theyre real which obviously you cant always guarantee online i love cosplayers who are sociable and are open to helping others regardless their skill     i dont like cosplayers who think are entitled just because they got over a 1000 likes or something or cosplayers who call themselves the best or cosfamous or the ones that are clearly looking for attention and/or more likes kinda reminds me of those youtubers who start to do insane stuff just for views
someone who wont hesitate to help others and remains down to earth no matter how popular they get  as someone with a fairly large follower base its awful how everyone expects this of you yet they do not realize how many messages and questions sometimes absurd or undefined you get i ignore a lot of them and youre a bitch immediately  im not a social person it exhausts me a lot so a lot of people immediately assume im too important for them
  not to mention the creeps in peoples inboxes sometimes im thankfully spared from it mostlybut ive seen the things some people receive oh dear
  this i love to help people but i have a day job too sometimes its just gonna take me a while to type out the exact explanation and gather the references i still do it because i think teaching others is an important part of being in the cosplay community but people honestly expect you to be oncall 24/7 people need to learn that they can either google how to worbla themselves or wait until i have time for them
  wasnt it also because she didnt want someone else to do it though  i still honestly thing she traces or at least partially traces and adds the hairface herself  because some art she sells as a standalone stand also looks oddly familiar
  just close your dms its really that easy
  i suppose thats just what happens when youre used to drawing a specific style it just all looks the same way
the cosplay competition registrations for animecon will open on december 15th at 800 anyone here who plans on competing
  nope not worth the effort only to have to travel to another con a year later as a reward ill just be making pictures and hang outside like i did this year that was quite fun
  as a cosplayer for 10 years i helped other cosplayers a lot like making stuff for them but every single time they took it for granted some of them i used to be friends with but since they got more followers/likes they treated me like shit now i dont help any cosplayer than only little things
im planning to do a duo with my mom 
ugh why do people feel the need to slut up the powerpuff girls
  originally i was planning to but i havent even bought tickets yet so im not competing
so i just discovered guild games is something is it any fun or good
  its not
  its worse than tomo
    yes at the end it is the only competition where you are taken seriously participated a few times before and will try this year again
  im taking a break this year after participating for a few consecutive years its nice to not have to worry about it for a change
  last time they had only 16 visitors
the oiled ass is turning into the oiled tits o god
  oh help  she also wanted a samus zero latex suit for 2019
      why are you all so obsessed with her
  i was actually trying to figure out what her ig was again because i forgot her name i just find it amusing
  seems legit
  isnt that what she wants i mean she is buying tits for fame
  thats a pretty weird and disrespectful assumption to make do you honestly believe all peoples lives are centered around their cosplayhobby
  can you blame people for assuming that when all u do is post pictures with your lips out though     im not saying above person is right but i understand where the thoughts come from
  the thoughts probably come from an oldfashioned mindset where people think its normal to be disrespectful to anyone who has made the concious choice to show their more private parts even when they do it structurally i dont think theres a good reason to be disrespectful and make unnecessary assuptions about their private lives
  oh hell no
post tattoo ideas that look good for lolitas im basically looking for something monochromatic for my upper arm
i dont really see a point you can wear so many accessories on your hands/elsewhere why actually paint your body    if you go to japan some day you wont be able to go to public baths as well
if youre going to make a thread like this at least make it for cgl in general not just for lolita this thread is going to die without much inspo
tattoos make lolita look messy
  why would anyone want to go to a public bath is beyond me unless youre scandinavian or something
  its a bit beyond that just everyone over there will look strangely at you because tatoos are a yakuza thing a lot of other places in the world also view it as something dirty/criminal    i live in a place where everyone and their mum has a tatoo so i can kind of understand the appeal but it seems to me that the theme of sweet or classic lolita/cutesy fashion and tatoos just dont match    i can totally see tatoos go with gothic or punk though
  they wont because im not asian japanese people are not all retarded they wont think a blonde lolita girl is with the yakuza
  btw tattoos and piercings do match lolita because of the people who wear it people have even said they saw japanese staff from sweet lolita brands with facial piercings and tattoos
  tatoos  this isnt the correct spelling    you seem to be not english
tattoos only have a chance of looking good with gothic or punk lolita if you really want a tattoo then go ahead and get it but theres no point in getting one with the purpose of looking good with sweet or classic because no tattoos ever really do
  is this your first time realising that there are nonnative english speakers on the internet
  its not much but i like tattoos and i like lolita this whole no tattoos reee is such an outdated means of thinking
get a btssb logo tramp stamp
  the moitie one looks so much cooler than the other one
  not at all but people who have odd out dated opinions regarding what the youth does are usually from places where english isnt even a second language
  this is actually cool seems like being done for gothic lolita but chandelier theme is pretty versatile for all styles
  thats a pretty broad accusation to make just for the record english is my second language and im in my 20s
  the youth  because only the youth gets tattoos lmao
  so youre just culturally inept then got it       i guess there are grannies in biker gangs who get them but lets be real those people arent posting here and instead we get larpers who think its cool to act like a pearl clutching grandma or muhammad the slut shamer
  i love when tattoofags reveal the depraved attention whores they are by asking other people what they should permanently put on their body
  i dont think thats true for all of them and probably just for normies but a lot of gulls who claim to be lolita reek of normie and dying to fit in kind of sad     youd think if someone wanted a tattoo and they were actually really into lolita enough to get a tat of it that they would just get part of a print they really enjoy or a bow or something else cutsie like usakumya this didnt need a thread and is clearly bait
i have a small handpoked beatrix potter rabbit tattoo and i love it works very well for classic never regretted it but im more into clothes than tattoos so thats never going to be where my  is going    i dont know why you would come to a tattoo thread to bash people that have them if you find them offensive or garish then the thread is not for you
  oh sweet summer child
  wtf is with that unsolicited salt anon i just made a typo relax
  this whole no tattoos reee is such an outdated means of thinking  i agree with this ive got a tat and a piercing too and wear lolita   tattoos are also becoming more acceptable in japan especially among young people    tat/piercing doesnt fit your coord then work/coord around it     posting some stuff from my tattoo inspo folder
  thats gonna age like shit
i like the bottom part of this and the colors also wouldnt be visible under a petti
some general /cgl/ shit that could work
  actually all you have to do is google tattoo friendly public baths in japan and you can find some quite easily i recently stayed at a tattoo friendly onsen ryokan in the countryside and it was a great experience
  also you can get skin bandages to cover them and youre fine
there are foundations that are meant for covering tats i think you could do whatever you want and be okay     i personally want an usakumya
i have tattoos on both my thighs and a big one on the underboob area they are always hidden so no problem i guess   i think pastel colored or flower themed ones work really well with lolita
  when you are at the age that it will look like shit you likely will look like shit in general anyways so doesnt really make a difference
these are all gay af
  which ryokan didnt happen to be in fukushima did it
  nah thats not the point tattoos without black linework tend to fade really quickly
  you made a typo several times
  why didnt you just say that the first time then
  like most lolitas then
  thats probably the point
  this have modern lolitas forgotten this fashions roots as a street style look back at old glbs and such coloured hair and piercings are more common than not          i will say that these pastel cutesy tattoos usually look really ugly and out of place to me i prefer a classic lineart/greyscale style that contours with the body       im planning on getting the btssb logo on my forearm just below the inside of my elbow most of my tattoos arent visible in lolita although i have a dotwork heart shaped mandala on my hand that looks adorable when peeking out from a wristcuff or lace sleeve      that sounds super cute
  no strawberry themed coord is complete without a matching tattoo
  i love kewpies as well
  i always wonder about these cute tiny florals i just feel like theyre so small and have no outline are they gonna last more than5 years
  i want the face of one of my cats but im worried they wont do it justice shes so pretty and has lots of details  i also want to cover my scar on the forearm thats going to be a big tat but it will look cool because i wear gothic
  u may not see a point anon but tattoos are a personal choice not for everyone but beautiful when done well
gonna dump some artists i likemostly blackwork and not lolita specific but i think would look nice on lolitas    starting off with my latest obsession im thinking someday id like a lace sleeve or maybe even use a lace design from a dress i love
  same artist she does amazing paintingstyle color pieces too but i just love the black/grey lace stuff so much
  i think painterly flowers would look super great on classic lolitas
  same artist as above i know a lot of people look the more delicate looking tiny flowers but this shit looks like an oil painting and i live for it
  blackwork florals would work really well for gothic/classic lolitas i think flowers in general are a pretty nonobtrusive safe bet
  this artist does these interesting girl faces and i think she would do an interesting take on something lolita related i really love the way she does the eyes
  this artist does creepy victorian children also some regular creepy victorians and also clowns i kinda want a hoverloli from her
  some alice in wonderland stuff this artist does mostly weeb shit but i think if you find someone who specializes in that chances are they can do some kawaii bullshit for you
  i think the whole point is that they fade and then your next one in the same place can be whatever you want i really want a tiny delicate one with fine lines but dont really want people to be like you have a pen smudge on your wrist when it fades
  im not super onboard with watercolor style tattoos but i find this style really pretty
  this super soft style is pretty lolitaappropriate imo shoutout to korean tattooers out there doin crazy shit
  thanks for the dump anon these are great      i feel like based off the thumbnail this might look like a birthmark or something from far away irl but hey thats guro lolita as fuck right
  when in doubt get some classicass art      oh im glad you like it i wasnt sure if anyone care these arent actually lolitarelated but i think tattoos get a bad rep because lots of people dont get good ones and people dont know of different styles
  idk why i just really like these derpy cats
  more tiny florals but it looks like it has a verrrry thin black line around it i wonder it that makes it hold
  seeing tattoos of architecture always makes me think of the cool printinspired tattoos you could get moitie is the obvious choice but iw and jetj have some good ones too
  aaaand ending with some fine line florals that one one could ever possibly be offended by
  oh thats hannah flowers tattoo she tattooed my shins
  t someone who has clearly never been to japan or at the least not as a tattooed gaijin and thus has no real perspective on the matter    i had little old ladies in bumfuck nowhere stop to compliment my tattoos the japanese arent some mystical medieval fantasy race anon they do have some concept of the modern world
sorry if i go a bit off topic but i think its easier to list tattoos that dont look good with lolita since most do look good with it at least from my point of view you will always find someone who doesnt agree but honestly who cares     traditional style   chunky fonts   very big tattoos especially if not simmetrical like you have one on one arm while the other arm is bare   sleeve tattoos   realistic style   tattoos with one dominant colour that can look bad with the colour of your coord   elements that clash with your lolita style eg black skulls clash with sweet but are okay with gothic    there can be exceptions obviously but i think most of these usually look not that good with lolita
  she does amazing work anon youre so lucky is that a mucha piece
  i mostly just had people trying to take sneaky photos of some of my pieces which was actually pretty funny    its a mucha inspired but combined with the left shes really amazing at designing things as well
  is that leyendecker i see  good taste hes fantastic
  im really curious as to how something like this would age it looks amazing right now while its so fresh and clean but i wonder what it will look like a few months or years from now ive no tattoos yet but something delicate and feminine would be amazing
  well the reason im mostly against the watercolor trend is because im doubtful of it aging well but this is all contained in a thin black like so i think the shape would hold the colors might dull a little over time but overall i think youd be okay
  no it was in gunma prefecture in a town called shima onsen
  it ages really poorly the thin black lines start to fade within 2 years and need to be touched up
i plan to get tattoos but i wouldnt want them to be visible for the most part the one im getting right now is of lady oscar and thats a thigh piece the next one i want to be a sternum/underboob floral piece if i was more adventurous i would consider getting something subtle that goes up the back of my calves in a pretty design so it could compliment my coords but alas im not that brave lol
  mucha and leyendecker  good taste gull
    same for one thing any hot spring with private couples room rentals is available to you theres one right outside tokyo called yamatonoyu that does this and its worth absolutely every penny and there are plenty of standard onsen/ryokan who have loosened their policies in recent decades to accommodate tourism i went to an absolutely astonishing one in the countryside south of nara called tsuburokoonsen that had no problems whatsoever with my huge back piece and anklet highly recommend if you can get down there but fyi transit is kind of sketchy once in the little town so make sure you speak good moon language

theyre making fake twitter accounts now to make it look like guests are cancelling    theyre really scraping the barrel this time around please go away boycott am all of your followers literally go to the con anyway youre wasting your time and making our community look fucking worse than it is
    look at the times and dates hysterical how literally no one caught this   there are people on the facebook thread praising boba enterprises and shutting people down asking if its legit    one dumbass even said yeah it takes like 2 minutes of research to see that its legit    they literally think twitter cant be wrong
yaaaay     oooooo the tea is so good today  oooooo thats what they get    this proves that the boycott appeals to actual morons and virtue signalers its pathetic please go try to ruin someone elses fun
        hi denise hi daniella   having fun

hello im the president and ceo of bubble tea those tweets are real and i did decide to back out of bubble teas agreement to be a guest at this event
  this one looks like it was meant to be a joke maybe they overestimated how clear the jokeness would be to people it seems obvious to me but clearly isnt to anon or to the people praising this president of boba tea is like saying king of hot dogs it and the concept of boba tea pulling out of something reads as a joke after thinking about it two seconds
    im all for jokes ironic posts and satire but my point is that 99 of the boycott am people literally believed it upon first sight and shared it with those intentions    tldr boycott am followers are actually retarded
  hey at least they arent as retarded enough to kiss the ground a scammer pedophile walks on
  this is going to blow up in your face and make am die faster
            theres no words to express how sad this is its always hilarious when con owners try to defend their cons on cgl
revival edition    do  post accounts you follow  ask for/share advice  selfpost  keep it civil    dont  act like a retard  insult other people    dont selfpost if youre going to shit up the thread trying to defend yourself
northeast na photog here   im booked for anyc but send over a dm if youd like to shoot anytime in the future with the exception of katsu not too sure if i want to start taking bookings right now am also open to location shoots if youre a reasonable distance away from me im pretty close to nyc   to any photogs lurking /cgl/ pls tell me what i need to work on

tips for improving engagement ig only shows to about 300800 people while i have 2k followers out of those 150300 like back when i had 1k it was way higher with 300 likes regularly i did take a big break at start of year
  it seems to be a general problem a lot of the larger accounts have noticed that less people see their posts than before i only have like 5000 followers but i too noticed that a few months ago i regularly had 500 likes while now its more like 200300 the quality of my posts has not changed it really seems that they are not as visible as before apparently its a change in the algorithm that is causing this
self posting i dont have a ton of feed content but i post lots of progress on my story kind of slow right now though because of college but planning on starting up again this weekend wayracosplay
  i like your color grading and compositions a lot a lot better than most cosplay photogs ive seen lol    im not super deep into photography so take my advice with a grain of salt but looking through your gallery you dont seem very careful with some of your brush adjustments / masks theres some weird dodging / burning going on in some pics  dark shadows that look obviously airbrushed / dont follow the shape of the form halos around figures  as well as some excessive unnatural blurring in areas     id refrain from relying too much on blur / the clarity slider to lessen wrinkles in clothing because it makes it look weirdly painterly and pushes it into the background instead id use the clone stamp or healing brush in ps on lighten mode so it doesnt make more creases to lessen wrinkles masks in photoshop are a lot easier to do cleanly than in lightroom imo  same with skin skin texture is completely lost in some pics and its pretty offputting    sorry if im completely missing the mark on any of this ill probably hit you up for cosplay pics in the future your work is really pleasant otherwise and i can tell you put care into it
  thanks for the input   i definitely think i go a bit too sloppily overboard with dodging burning and frequency separation sometimes and the thought of wtf she looks like some sort of uncanny valley porcelain doll now has passed through my mind a decent amount of times lol   ive legitimately never thought to simply clone out wrinkles in ps will keep that in mind next time thanks you were spot on with using clarity to try to remove those wrinkles lol     ive indeed been using lightroom for most of my masking but i have been thinking about switching over to photoshop for that and only using lightroom for culling color grading and fixing up exposure/highlights/shadows only using the sliders     im thinking of trying to rely a loooot less on post production and go for a more natural approach next year some of these shots out of camera are completely unuseable lel   definitely hit me up whenever we are at the same con my experience with working with gulls has always been a chill positive time so ill absolutely welcome more from this board
  dont selfpost if youre going to shit up the thread trying to defend yourself  why self post if anons are just going to shit on you and then you get no say in it because that makes it worse    inb4 you got posted
  not op of this thread but im the person who wrote that op originally i guess its not really clear but i meant those people who would defend themselves to death even after people stopped talking about them
  the issue seems pretty widespread my engagement rate is down to 17 the lowest its been in a year from a steady 3045 2 months ago according to igblade  i think posting consistent wip stories helps generate hype for costumes and the more people reply to the progress the more posts get boosted on feeds pretty sure the reason my engagement dropped so much is because im not currently making anything
  ive read a lot of things about using different hashtags and not to use the same ones over and over but that honestly doesnt seem to make any difference at all     i dont live for likes on instagram but the new algorithm really seems to favour a lot of shit posts i dont mean itas or bad cosplays i mean my explore page is full of those posts that consist of twitter screenshot memes or clickbait makeup tutorials i keep selecting show me fewer posts like this but it doesnt seem to make a difference     i used to get about 200300 likes a post and now im barely scraping 150 instagram is so money hungry they really want people to spend to promote posts and its weird its exactly what happened with pages on facebook
anyone follow active lolitas with unique coords preferably 800 or less followers looking for some new accounts to follow
  why do they have to have such a low amount of followers just ask for good accounts to follow suited to the style you like
  so they can get an excuse to self post lul        ive been seeing users who have been growing exponentially though so im just at a loss
  nayrt but its so that the same people who everyone follows dont keep getting recommended its nice to have some freshness in the mix
im into lolita and jfashion what tags should i be using i has great post engagement during october for using halloween relevant tags but thats over now and i feel lost i already use the japanese tags for kawaii lolita and lolita fashion
  because i probably already follow most high count lolitas lol    accounts i like  evanthelolita  mm_lolita  rinmatter  starry_seiun  rosenocturnalia  tsumikko  hitomihime7488  raphaelle_ad_nauseam  vudu_juju  dustmite_goddess  _ikako  831acre  spyholespectre  livlotte  jfashion_archives  kurofrills  m_hikaru  castelies  la_odile  cryptkasper  thingsweneverdid    i am mostly looking for lolitas that seem to have their own style and dont feel like a normie wearing a costume
  egl eglcommunity selca altfashion whatever brands you are wearing
  im the person who wrote that op originally  so you made the first ever ig thread with that statement  doubtful
whats a good rule of doing multiple posts of the same costume honestly i get so worried about spamming people that i end up posting 1 pic per cosplay which is really really bad for being active
  yep i was the one who wrote the first ig thread with that op how is that doubtful not like these ops come out of nowhere      i like it when people do several posts of the same costume that show off different parts of it or different shots from a photoshoot   the spamming that gets boring is when theres a lot of repetition between posts eg same costume in the same location with little to no variance in poses
  i just make sure to never post the same costume more than once a week and take care to get a lot of dynamic photos in shoots that all have different posing moods or background
  that would mean you monitored the board all the time   just shut up  youre not important
frillyfix seems to be up and coming i like the idea of experimenting with colorways on past releases
  nayrt but are you literally retarded anyone can post threads with whatever they want in the op anon just happened to make one that stuck  you do realise that op stickies arent handed down from god himself and anyone can make them right  getting this up in arms about the sticky
  up and coming  8 posts and 7 followers  its ok anon selfposting is allowed
    what do you guys think i can do to improve my quality of content to achieve more follows any criticism welcome abuse me if you must
  keep lifestyle / food / stuff to your stories i never follow people that post a lot of unrelated things unless theyre friends
  i actually like this its a unique take on a lolita account and i genuinely like some of the edits
soloslumberparty i consider myself a jfashion account that errs more to the side of personal friend pics nature home decor etc but if youre interested in making jfashion friends please follow i have made some great friends from threads like these  also im moving to japan in less than a week jic anyone is interested in that
  im trying to find the j fashion in this screencap a close up shot of an ap print doesnt really count this is just a normie account
  dont judge an account by its screenshot also im wearing a wig and seifuku in one pic and a vintage dress in another and a fint top in two others soi def couldve chosen a better screenshot i give you that but youre being a bit of a hardass
  implying a vintage dress is jfash
  fuck off anon anon already provided a screenshot that shows the jfash side of her account   nitpicks like you are why no one wants to selfpost anymore
  ntayrt but that second screenshot has barely any jfash   stop getting butt blasted that people dont appreciate your normie posts
  tysm for sticking up for me anon but im down to bow out now lol if someone wants to follow me from here then they will if they dont then they wont no need to defend the content of my account when my url is right there
  agreeing with       i generally will not follow or unfollow people who post that sort of stuff
  no instagram was ever stickied youre delusional
  thread
    by the sticky the anon meant the description of the thread ive attached a screenshot to help you understand
sleepyclaudie for idols n stuff
  i like how you stoped posting a cap of your insta nice to know youre a trippfag now
  get a load of this newfag
these threads are such a mess
  now   welcome to cgl enjoy your stay
  go make a tik tok if you want to be so efamous
  you need to be 18 to use this site
  thats not what stickied means on this site
great thread retards
  im interested in seeing examples that feel like a normie wearing a costume
    lol i love you
so i was looking at who had viewed my instagram stories and i noticed something weird i currently have 3 photos up and it shows that a friend saw the most recent photo but not the other 2 that i posted before that one how is that possible i thought stories played in the order that they were posted is there an option that changes the order of my posts or is this more likely a glitch on instagrams end
  is this more likely a glitch on instagrams end  probably a glitch ive had this happen with my stories too
my user is yowaseru  i know gyaru isnt popular anymore but i still like interacting with other jfashion people i like all fashions/communities    im trying to up my engagement a bit more do you all have any tips for engaging captions or tags or perhaps content suggestions i tend to stay away from reviews since i dont like reading them
  i died
  it may be hard for you to understand anon but theres more than one meaning to a word
  i follow you already and i love your posts i wish i could wear gyaru and pull it off like you do
can someone give me recs on cute feet accoubts haha please
  god i love your outfits thanks for posting and for keeping gyaru alive you actually got me interested in gyrau originally
idk if this is for lolita only but i figured id post some of my favourite cosplay accounts some are bigger and some are smaller but theyre some of the people i follow because i actually really admire and like what they put out instead of obligation or mutuals or whatever    isaisanisa  angelicdazecosplay  trillianzee  philmizuno  amazonmandy  melanierae_x  pitchforkcosplay  bird__king  helloiambird  keltonfx  luxlocosplay  whitemajesty  kohcoz  wickedsalt  princessrabbits  ironicallynautical    
too many assholes to have a good instagram thread go have an anal wax still more productive than your stupid criticism
  i need more gay buff cosplayers in my feed im already following zayan are there anyone else
since there havent been tumblr thread in ages are people returning there ive gotten more followers and notes in past few weeks than whole past year and the accounts seem legit or is it because no one goes there anymore and they find me easier
anyone know of any good jfashion related pods i dont really need one but honestly its nice to have a little instagram community to chat with about japanese fashion/cosplay/general instagram stuff  if there are none would anyone like to start one with me
  i own a small alternative fashion pod hosted on telegram but its a very relaxed one by cgl standards some of the people there wouldnt even classify as proper jfashion accounts still everyone loves japanese culture and fashion we have two group chats one for sharing pictures only and one for chatting lately the pod has been pretty quiet we have 20 members but like all pods people tend to get inactive over time if youre okay with an easy going pod feel free to contact me on ig aocchan oh and if you create one from zero and think my account is okay id like to join 
  lol sorry its morning and im sleepy aocchan is my nick on telegram on instagram im lofi_girl
cybikko  i made an account to catalog all my outfits and follow others in all sorts of jfashion communities i mostly wear dolly kei menhera and gothinspired fashion and i dont really have one specific aesthetic id love to make friends who are into any style  im still pretty new to using ig any advice on posting/concrit
trying to find new lolita accounts to follow who are the last three lolitas you followed on instagram
ryusei_cos    i post cosplay wips primarily
  cupcake_kamisama  audreyvonrosenberg  rinmatter
  cupcake_kamisama  gross
  what instas do you prefer anon
  just some advice from my point of view feel free to ignore if you dont agree    frame pictures better if youre taking an outfit picture your figure should be clearly visible dont make 1/3 of the picture sky or background and cut your feet at the same time also place the camera at your waist otherwise your legs will look tiny while the head is bigger if youre going for a long shot place the camera far if you want to make an aesthetic pic close ups are usually better i like your mirror selfies and the two pictures of the old building thingy
 devilorns    i do wear lolita but at this point my ig is essentially cosplays and wips and exclusively boring ootds
  your halloween pics are super cute i love the colors
  thanks anon ill keep the photography tips in mind
  lacroixlolita  nainokatara_  la_odile
  why shes cute and very welldressed for a bigger girl
  they just wanted to shit on this thread i guess
  thank you
  would you suggest removing it all in order to make it less cluttered
  goblin slayer armor  based and redpilled
semirealbeing has a cute insta from my comm she has a kind of sketchy reddit but her instagram account has been pretty cute so far id say check her out
  sketchy reddit    you cant just say that and leave us in the dark anon
  who the hell uses the same account names when you add your legal name to one of them and post fetish shit to the other
  i get the feeling that you posted this just to get people to check out her sketchy reddit rather than as a sincere recommendation
  oh wow another ageplay lolita what a big fucking surprise ugh
  im thinking that same thing that or theyre trying to hide theyre a dd/lg follower as well and are too stupid to realize the anonymity of 4chan i know so many people who cover their kinks by trying to get you to follow people also in their kinks for other reasons but then have to throw in oh but just ignore that gross kink shit but thats their whole plan is to make you see the link shit in the hopes youre into it too smh
  theyre fuckin everywhere makes me sick i wont even wear sweet anymore because im sick of the comparisons i get to these creeps theyve literally ruined it for me
  seriously the only age player lolitas i know of arent really lolita are we talking about actual lolitas
  yeah unfortunately ive met a handful of for real lolitas i later found out were ageplayers and used their same coords they used for meet ups as part of their kink in their everyday life i wont wear sweet anymore because the last time i wore ott sweet i had a girl mistake me for another age player and thought it would be hilarious to joke about the stain on her skirt coming from daddys cummies while i was trying to just enjoy my tea so nope never again
  just followed you your construction writeups are really impressive i especially love your yasuho
  followed you because of your juliet its amazing
anyone with better creativity can help me come up with a good instagram name for me  i basically want to do and did a couple times ridiculous crossplays showing maximun gains and show off my autism  i would go along the lines of maxgainscosplay but i feel its too shitty
  brickshithousecosplay
  yesidog4p
  is it weird to be into ageplay and then be cosplay bffs with underage im talking 1214 girls seems strange to me
  be cosplay bffs with underage im talking 12  hold up  what the fuck
  i know shes good friends with a few cosplayers in my area who are literally in middle school and i know one just turned 13 recently im also pretty sure that shes in a love live group with them as well though some people in that group are latehighschool age about half of them are in middle school semi is 19
  shes recruiting for daddys daycare
  so an adult who wants to pretend shes not an adult by surrounding herself with children that just adds a whole new level of crazy into this im concerned for those kids
  uh yeah that seems more than just strange to me seems predatory
    jesus fuck this reminds of how i accidentally befriended an older guy when i was 17 who had a bunch of 1314 girls always hanging around him at cons he later admitted to me he was banned from some local con for sexually assaulting a 13 year old girl but told me he thought she was older and consented to it at the time
      kind of sketchy  yea no this is full blown cringe
  v nice work anon followed    anyone else have any cosplay wip instas i could use the motivation
  does she bring her princess potty to meets to shit in
  talk to some rando who doesnt seem to have any friends   she follows my insta   keeps sending me messages even though i give no or single word replies   turns out shes 15 and im p sure she wants my cock   s t o p h e l p
  no pretty sure thats what the goodnights are for
  thats disgusting omg
  shes definitely predatory in a sense no idea about any kids but i have friends who told me of some really horrid things she did to them and others
  hi ))) haha just wondering if you shit in your pants in public just to feel that warm sensation ))) just asking haha )))
  brickshithousecosplay  lmao i like this one i think i will use it    also yesterday was my 3rd con i cosplayed and some trannie put the photo he took with us as his profile pic   love it
  do you know if this is her in the red and black she looks really familiar but i didnt want to assume the wrong person i only ever had her on facebook and didnt want to drop names
dreamcathedral  im pretty camerashy/potatogenic and dont post super often but id like to start eventually posting coords most of my posts are just fun things i make primarily got into the hobby for making lolita accessories
  id rather not go look but are there any pictures of her actually doing any of this stuff on there theres just something about the way that anon was like oh totally dont go check out her reddit guys its sketchy that makes me think that it might actually be someone pretending to be her also the part where she has the exact same username i know a lot of people are stupid enough to do that but i dont know something about this seems fishy to me i might be wrong though
  her instagram would say yes shes got this on there
  i dont know her well but i saw her reddit a while back when i followed her on instagram it was all pretty much just role play stuff at the time though id say its her shes tagged her boy on both accounts and he has the same usernames too and his account is old id say it would be pretty hard to fake that
  what  said she has that exact same outfit on a post on her instagram she also has what is presumably her full name on her insta so i dont really think name dropping would be a problem here
  care to elaborate im the anon who knows her through the middleschoolidolgroup thing id like to warn those kids about what shes done in the past before something happens to them
  normally i shit on people that try to shill their wares on 4chan like hbj but you seem so humble and aloof that i cant hate you  please get a better quality camera though
  thanks for making this thread shitty i guess
  i havent done that in insta threads
  okay then thats good
  i really dont want to go into a lot of details because im worried this would get back to my friends who are in therapy over the situations and i really dont want to cause them extra grief than whats already being suffered through ill just leave a warning to not be alone with her things have been done to nonconsenting adults that i wouldnt want done to a child
  nayrt but i think you should make up your mind before you post a comment if youre not going to tell the whole story or some proof what you say isnt totally made up you should as well keep silent
self post im thinking of transitioning my personal instagram to either a strictly jfashion one or at least more lolita focused one is it better to start a whole new one
  ill speak to them first and see if theyd be willing to let others know the whole story i definitely spoke out of turn there i just dont want to cause more problems if she decides to retaliate against them because of the details this whole thing has just been worrisome after seeing details i didnt know about her
  no no this wasnt what i wanted at all i just really liked her instagram and had had some previous friends come back at me about the reddit account so i didnt want anyone to focus on that because her cosplays are still really good i didnt know there was any controversy with her and any real life kids im sorry i even brought her up
  holy shit is this for real
  itll be fine anon i just feel bad about shitting up the thread with this stuff since its massively off topic    as an apology here are some cosplayers controversial or not i dont know i happen to follow and find interesting theyre not necessarily the most talented    freckledstardust  seunbaes  eulixi  sageblossom_cos  itsmur  silversh33p  cowbuttcrunchies actually really talented
  also kind of related to my first post and instagram    but how much stuff do you guys upload lets say monthly  i feel nobody is going to become interested in following someone that uploads 3 pictures every 23 months at shitty cons    even if i try to make mental gymnastics explaining how i do it for the lulz and the fun i really want some attention to at least feel i can get som puss puss and keep tfwnogf away
  yeah i got too caught up but thank you for the recommendations
  not for my cosplay insta but for my everyday one i found i get more subscribers when i post about 5 times a week
  yay youre back i love you
  thanks      thanks
  doesdoes she want a baby potty to shit in
  57 times a week any less than that and my growth slows down substantially if i go a few days without posting i usually lose followers
    im a lolita and i find i get subscriber fatigue if i post any more than every 23 days any less though and my engagement also dramatically drops with the next post and takes a while to build up again its all about consistency imo
  oh dang im one of the people in this list i just came here to self post but now i just wanna say thank you so much the absolutely made my day and im extremely flattered anyone thinks of me so highly
  you have a cute face and i love you and i love your art so much
  omg thats so cool i posted that which one are you
  maybe this is just my old age showing but i reallydont get this are people seriously obsessively monitoring everyone they follow ready to drop them like a hot potato as soon as they dont deliver content for a few days kids these days
      so basically between twice and 5 times a week is the optimal range  the problem is then what do you post i dont have anything to upload unless its really shitty photos of myself with a skirt and flexing in front of a mirror doing whatever pose is now the meme    btw thx for responses i know this is a slow board and im obv a newfag here
  57 times a week i double post monthly for things like photoshoot openings but daily is usually good
  spend 300 dollars on a basic camera and a 50mm 18 lens and go out and take pictures of your cord tbf
  most likely haha
  take different pics of your coord take preview pictures showcasing specific pieces random aesthetic pics if you do one coord per week or so it can be very easy to hit the 5 pictures per week
    desu my friend isnt really muscular nor that interested he just wanted to do funny things with a skirt for the fun of it  dont have much material to work and dont have close friends to take me pics but i guess thats my problem so ill try to find someone and do what you guys say maybe in the long run  ty
  its more about the instagram algorithm if you dont post a lot instagram wont show your new posts to a lot of your followers and you definitely wont get on any explore pages so new people cant find you the more you post the more the instagram algorithm favours you but if you post too much your followers will get fatigued and your posts wont do as well so its all about finding the best balance between catering to the algorithm and to your followers which in my experience is 36 times a week
  yes its almost always better to cut the personal stuff from the jfashion if youre approaching it from a numbers perspective its a lot better aesthetically too
chilltrooper420  just an amateur cosplayer if you can even call me that  mostly at los angeles based conventions
  dudeweedlmao  that sign    dude  
  ah im on this list too im super flattered thank you
  oh wow which one are you
  wickedsalt
  bird__king     o hi mutual
  im not really that serious about ig and i just mainly post a coord when i feel like it but i still wonder why earlier in the autumn when i posted regularly my engagement dropped to like 1/3 of the normal and now its back to normal when i only post once every few weeks i usually use the amount of likes as concrit if it makes sense but its so inconsistent now i cant do that anymore really
  i cant believe stuff like this happens in public for real i mean were on 4chan right only a fool would take stories posted here seriously
  dude
  some cringy bitch in my comm made the daddies cummies joke just because i was wearing melty sky the icing on the colorway i have isnt even white so clearly she was just looking for an excuse to make her shitty overplayed joke some people just cant hold back
  not the worst desu since all of cgl called it that regardless of colourway when it came out i wouldnt choose that reference in particular if i wanted to out myself as a gull tho
heya ive been working on my instagram a lot lately but i havent seen a lot of growth if you guys have constructive pointers dont be mean im sensitive id appreciate hearing them 
  i dont do cosplay so cant help you there but 1 remove dead/spam followers and 2 get into a comment pod
  ive done both though my comment pod is on the smaller side so maybe we need more people but yeah i remove bot and spam followers every so often
  im thinking of transitioning  stopped reading there dont do it anon
  i love seeing wip posts but i think your backgrounds for them are a bit too cluttered so its hard to browse at a glance when going through your feed jhart hasnt posted in a long time joshuahartdesign but i think his feed has nice examples of aesthetically pleasing wip white or uncluttered backgrounds and cropped so the subject is the only focus
  imagine still being this salty after two years
  i see what you mean and yeah hes a major role model of mine ill try i can probably set up some kind of backdrop to take wip photos
  all of cgl called it that regardless of colourway when it came out  yeah and it was just as fucking stupid and virgin like then too it was around the same time cause i got the dress not long after it came out i dont think she cared about outing herself cgl is whatever to my comm actually but god that joke is just fucking dumb doesnt even make sense    just like all this dumb 3 wolf moon shit thats happening theres only 2 wolves on the print for fucks sake
  i think its fine and i followed you  some of your descriptions are corny tho maybe dial it back a bit
  there are also timestamps which would take a lot of dedication if this was a troll
  being this salty about people liking a joke you dont
  i love comedy anon jim norton and norm macdonald are fucking hilarious but thats because their jokes make sense    jizz is never the color purple or dark blue so the joke is fucking stupid unless youre uneducated jackass who has never seen semen    and there are only 2 wolves on the dress there were 3 on the shirt people are literally saying haha 3 wolf moon dress  thats fucking wrong stupid learn simple math
  with this level of nitpickery and the need for facts to be so exact for them to be valid as a joke you may have autism just saying
anyone interested in a pod on discord or somewhere else for japanese fashion stuff or even cosplay
  i am let me know
  really shit i made this a few years back for my oc from shopping his god tier joker cosplay who knew itd be relevant someday
  thats not what autism is
  i am as well please post if you make it
  how the fuck do yall have interesting shit to post 5 times a week is it just a set of photos one posted each day or are yall taking snaps of your cosplays and lolita while grocery shopping and taking your morning dump
  i post once a day its not hard i have photoshoots stockpiles and pictures from 2015 ive never posted anywhere and i do a new shoot every other weekend or so when i supplement all that cosplay content with my more casual jfashion stuff it gives me a ridiculously large well to pull from thats mostly pro quality instead of cell phone pics too if you want to post more often i suggest focusing on getting a lot of content made marathon style and then just sitting on it until you have a day with nothing new planned just dont post from the same set more than once a week to keep it fresh
  if you dont mind me asking how do you manage gathering content for a photoshoot every other weekend im struggling to create enough material to posts to my insta currently since i only do a handful of photoshoots a year
  i have my own dslr and lighting setup so ill generally meet with other cosplayer friends and well shoot each other to avoid photographer costs i can edit my own stuff and desu every cosplayer imo is at least an okay photographer because we know what we want in terms of actual costumes i have my fancy stuff and big builds for cons of which i go to about 6 or 7 a year but for my weekend shoots i just pull together easy thrifted cosplay items with nicely styled hair and makeup for normal clothes characters and for costests im trying to make at least 1 post a week fashion so thatll make content even easier since i can just take it with tripod and thatll be a day
is it recommend to start a different insta for cosplay and jfashion posting i am deciding to do it on my personal insta but i see lot of people having a separate account    what do you guys/girls think
  i think its better to keep two separate ones not everyone who likes cosplay also likes jfashion and viceversa if its too much of a bother though just keep one in the end it doesnt really matter
  yeah that is true i just started to do cosplay and jfashion is more of a interested then a hobby so i think i make a cosplay account and keep my personal one for friends and family pictures    thanks for the advice 3
  i am also wondering this i have my personal instagram i have been using for years mostly for pictures i took with friends and on vacation     earlier this year i started to cosplay and made some nice pictures should i post them on my personal one or create a new one for all my cosplay and things related to it
heres some more cosplay accounts    starlight_queen_cosplays  scorpiomonster  peachytsundere  pikkamika  ivy_cos  yandere_oji
small lolita accounts you like
  5 pics of the same coord in a week is too much more than one is weird unless youre in a different environment or different people or something
  agree with 5 being too many but 2 or even 3 is okay if you change something for example with the same coord you can do outfit pic outfit with coat pic long distance shot with outfit and pretty place selfie pic outfit with other people
i want to create a new instagram for my cosplay to keep it separate from my personal one     any recommendations how to attract people to visit my page or see my post what kind of tags and how many uploads do you guys  girls do
  tbh small accounts received a very bad hit with this new algorithm and its extremely difficult to get popular or have followers now id say remove inactive followers and take part into pods as well as posting good content often i know not easy
  yeah i heard lot about the new algorithm why should you remove inactive followers what i can understand of the algorithm is that mostly based on activity and like ratio or something
  imo because insta continues to grow in number of users and the browse time per per person is a set limit you can only spend so much time on insta before you get bored of it its naturally gonna get harder as time goes on  just depends on what you want from instagram    if you want to use it as a launch point for eventual payed work or large fanbase social currency you gotta do a lot    best two ways to do it is to either socialize and network and exchange accounts with real people you meet to network/or keep as friends ooooooor to curate your top 12 posts to look perfect then follow and unfollow a buttload of people    posting every day doesnt help unless you already have the traction though commenting and liking stuff can help a bit but not much tags can help but theyre only useful if you go to a con and use whatever hashtag theyve got for it so you can targeted a niche tag thats under used and semi popular giant tags like cosplay are pointless because anything you post gets drowned out due to how many people post on it    or you can decide your not about that gay shit and just follow shit you like and use it to keep in contact with friends and accept youll never go above 400 followers without castrating yourself to the social media gods
how do you join a pod are there any jfashion/cosplay/lolita specific groups
  you just have to find one and ask to join check the cosplay marketing group on facebook or the jfashion discord link somewhere on this board look in the catalog
  why should you remove inactive followers  not officially confirmed bvut insta shows your new post to a fraction of your followers if most of them like it it gets shown to more if it doesnt get liked because all you have are inactive and spam followers it gets buried i was to almost 2k removed inactive followers until i reached 1k likes remained the same       good advice i especially agree with   tags can help but theyre only useful if you go to a con and use whatever hashtag theyve got for it  and about the follow unfollow method it works but is shitty just dont do it      how do you join a pod are there any jfashion/cosplay/lolita specific groups  think one was posted in this or the previous thread else make one yourself or follow  advice
what are your worst cosplay experiences
  is this supposed to be an example i think this is really cute
cosplay melted into itself
  2017 japan anime manga night in davos switzerland  went there with 7 friends  having a blast  lots of drinking  i do martial arts and one of my friends does too but a different form  every weekend we meet up to sharpen our techniques through sparring halfcontact  since were drunk and having fun we decided to do a little sparring just for shits and giggles at least i wanted to do that  friend throws out of the blue a jab and cross combination in full speed  barely able the sway my head away  while swaying he charges me and throws me to de ground  starts choking me from behind  i tap him 3 times to signal him that im giving up  he ignores the tapping and tightens his choke  nearly faint  other friends dont know if its playfighting or real  since im on the ground i can barely move  tell him to stop  he ignores it  start hitting his rips with my elbow and push thumbs ino his eyes  finally lets go  he starts screaming at me  him wtf man you nearly blinded me  me you nearly choked me you piece of shit  him that was just sparring dont be a pussy  i was consumed by anger and hate  other friends realize what happened and take my side  leave him alone and try to enjoy the rest of the con  nobody ever spoke to him again
  hey op that pic is cute as fuck    cosplay a character costume turns out good  so does make up  8 months later  decide to do it again for a different con  ask my artist cousin to do my make up to see what he can do  characters skin color is lighter than mine  he turns me into a ghost  i wanted to give it a phantasmagorical look anon    god i looked horrible and im happy there arent pics around of it i think pic not related just spreading cuteness
some years ago a furry from my high school that ive never spoken to before mind you saw me at a con he ran up to me picked me up and attempted to walk away without saying a word i was too shocked to really say anything i still dont know what he was trying to accomplish
my costume breaking on stage at international finals and nearly breaking my ankle in the process as well    it actually impacted me so much i havent done much cosplay work since i hated the costume i hated the pressure and its put me off entirely
in cosplay  at a shoot  see a cosplayer i talked to the previous day  think hey ill go ask him for his ig since i didnt get it yesterday  go up to him  moment i open my mouth i start having a coughing fit  he looks anxious  mrw i realize how horrible i am at social interaction  exchange igs  manage to get out a thank you and way away still coughing    probably not that bad for most people but for me it was like death
drop my cosplay walky talky on the con floor within minutes of arriving  shatters
youmacon 2018  bandeau top of cosplay got caught on my prop i was carrying to avoid poking anyone   the handle ends up getting caught and pulls my top down halfway since i was in a rush to a photoshoot i dont notice until a group of 3 guys scream loudly in the middle of the crowd i can see your nipples btw    i wanted to melt into the floor and die
posted someone blackfacing in a blackfacing thread  all her friends come after me on twitter the next day and call my a bully and say im making things up  she gets no repurcussion for painting her skin brown but i do for speaking up
  great dysfunctional friends youre having
  damn that is harsh i feel you
  this is really funny though you should try to get a more humoristic approach to life and learn to laugh about things like this for instance laughing about this even in the situation would have completely resolved it  nobodys perfect anon
  this fucking sucks anon
  and then everyone clapped
  good  i quite hate this witch hunt mentality when it comes to cosplayers making their skin darker for cosplays
  me too i crossed off a ton of cosplays i would have done but just dont care to anymore because someone would have my hide
  good
  kys sjw cunt
whole con is outside   almost floorlength cosplay skirt with details i cant wash its white obviously  taking pics in the grass  sudden unpredictable rain turns the ground into a muddy mess     to be fair this was only the third cosplay i ever made so i dont have a lot of bad experiences but boy did that bum me out after months of working on it shoes also got absolutely destroyed with mud
  lol eat shit retard
    please take this outside thank you
  kys sjw cunt  yikes
  that fucking sucks they couldnt have whispered it to you also primo pic
  not a cosplay story but ive been in your shoes before  catch a case of strep throat immediately following a long flu  lose my voice  i finally got to the doc after it doesnt go away and i see the signs on my throat  get prescribed antibiotics and large numbing lozenges for the pain while swallowing  a couple of days later im browsing my local comic book shop and want to go look at my pull list  theres a new girl at the counter i dont recognize i dont stalk the shop but i come often enough to recognize the workers  its not often that theres another female in the shop let alone a cashier so i want to make a good impression  i had been sucking on a lozenge earlier and tongue it out of the way to speak  take an inhale to start speaking and before i can even reach the second syllable it immediately lodges the oversized lozenge in my throat causing me to choke out loud  girl and bystander realize its not the average cough and look at me waiting to see if i need the heimlich  girl offers me her drink i politely wave it off wheeze a thank you and waddle off to the bathroom to half vomit it up  come back pinker than ever with a thumbs up  share a decent laugh over it    i havent seen that girl since but i highly doubt shes forgotten what an embarrassing moment that was
  i unfortunately know that feel i once spent hours and hours in advance preparing a wig piece for a costume including the entire night before the con i literally finished the moment my friend came in to tell me it was time to start getting ready to go my sleep was well sacrificed however because i felt proud of my work we get to the con and within no less than ten steps of the dealers hall someone pushes past me and knocks my hairpiece to the ground destroying it its not broken but messy beyond wear i hadnt even made it to the first booth yet
  non 4chan filename  fuck off crosssiter
this one is fairly recent so im still pretty pissed about it    cosplaying a magical girl character with a staff and hanging out with two friends   considered taking the staff i made myself but im not competing with the costume so i take another i bought which still looks great for photos and breaks down for easier transport  get the prop checked by staff to make sure its con safe and go on my way  theres a half hour where nothing is going on so we go to the games room to kill some time  people are already on the game we want to play so we wait for our turn   a gap frees up so i let friend a go first and i look after his bag in the meantime  a few more people from the group leave so friend a swaps with me and friend b also joins   ask friend a to hold my staff i trust him he lives with someone who is autistic and handles them well and is capable of telling people to fuck off  look back after finishing and the staff is not in my friends hands   a randomer has it  open mouth to tell him to give it back  he starts twirling it like a baton  time is suddenly in slow motion  topper flies off towards screens and games systems  the topper is oddly enough in one piece and i know i can just contact cement the fucker back on none of the equipment is damaged thank fuck   what the actual fuck  couldnt understand the stupidity of this person  randomer scarpers  ask friend how the heck he got it in the first place apparently he just took it  report the situation anyway and later find out its a staff member of the con in charge of the games room   figure there is no point in following up with that info because the rest of the staff would probably side with them
  nayrt but what the fuck man do you seriously think avid collectors of reaction images just leave the filenames as random numbers we need to find our damn images you absolute retard    did you know theres a whole thread culture of witty filenames on /tg/ with specific filename threads of course you dont because youre too fucking new
  yikes with that filename is the dead giveaway of a braindead tumblr knight
  if it was a braindead tumblr knight the image would be one of tumblrs stupid file names since someone braindead would be too stupid to change it retard
  renaming and thinking of something witty for each and every single reaction image you save  all that effort   nno thank you    filename threads are fun but  using filename thread images for general use
  alright you lazy piece of shit    im not here to change your lifestyle of mediocrity you do you and ill do it my way personally i think i save myself the effort of endless browsing having my witty names be searchable keep in mind we started this argument because someone named their file smugnya which is mostly for function and less for wits its more or less just describing the image my bottom line is dont accuse people of being crosssiters just because they keep their files in a sortable manner
staying in a hotel the day before otakagamecon laos 2016 with my sister  going to cosplay as a human wolf odonell from star fox 2  shes going as birdo from mario golf toadstool tour  make sure my costume is cleaned and laid out for tomorrow  go to sleep early so i can wake up early  wake up the next afternoon  find out the alarm clock was unplugged  im late  sister isnt there  my costume isnt there  all my clothes are also missing  her costume is still there  cant go to the con naked and i feel gross wearing the clothes i slept in so i put on her costume  head to the con to find her  a gang of yoshi cosplayers start following me  the eventually catch up to me and grab me  pull me into the room where the ghost of maddie blaustein is answering questions  they pull me on stage in front of everyone  my sister is there and she holds me down  pranked ya bro  the yoshis whip out their dicks and start jerking offf  they cum into the costumes mouth tube  forced to swallow all of it so i dont drown  everyone is cheering it on  i end up cumming in the costume  ive never gone to a con with my sister since then
  thanks anon im trying but i tend to beat myself up about this stuff a lot i was actually trying to laugh during the situation but i think he also has social anxiety so idk if it did anything       well at least you both laughed about it better than just standing there and i doubt hes forgotten either i still follow him on ig but im hoping he forgets who i am because goddamn
  i love it when sjw get bullied
  idiot
  just screencap all of them and call them all out for being racist enablers in a giant twitter thread
  nayrt but toughen up sjw
  being this buttmad about someone else cosplaying youre willing to ruin their life over makeup    oh no no no seagulls how pathetic can one be    let me guess you get irate when people wear gyaru too yeah
    what did i start here
colossalcon east 2018  need one more person for hotel  friendlets call her robin responds with much enthusiasm  fuck yeah  has 5 strong drinks night 0  wakes up next day im still drunk  doesnt eat breakfast drinks more  blacks out in hotel room in full cosplay  gotta play conmom  wakes up three ours later im hungry get me food now  get the bitch food  wants to go to suite party in heels with a bag  tell her its a bad idea  i dont care i can handle myself  no  go to friends room to chill out  robin sits on couch and lays back spread eagle  basically the kraken from the end of pirates 2  no underwear  no she wasnt hot in the slightest  blacks out twice on saturday  brought back by hotel security in a wheelchair   sunday wonders why were all pissed at her  drive home in silence  she did not change out of her costume or shower once that weekend  i dont think ill ever have a worse con experience
  oof anon im sorry bad roommates are the worst
  fucking disgusting behavior
  i expected there to be boys involved in that story    bad experience but it could have been worse
  ive seen a lot of stupid fake stories on this board and this is by far the stupidest
  why did you waste your and my time like this   give me this 1 min back you liar
i once ripped my friends top off because she handmade a love live cosplay or some idol shit and she was hosting a dance meet   i was being an absolute autistic spaz and was waving around someones really cool monado prop from xenoblade and it got caught on her tops strap and it about ripped it in half   i still feel bad
  ruin their life  post them in a blackfacing thread for blackfacing  if you cant handle people making fun of you when you pretend to be another race either dont do it or nut the fuck up and deal with the backlash
every time i wear tights with a costume ill step on myself like an idiot and tear them i need to fix the heels of my shoes so they dont do that anymore
  this didnt happen but if it ever did remember to use a safe word
  i bet you speak out against racism at thanksgiving too
  wtf is wrong with her painting her face brown
  nothing its a (((fellow white person))) trying to tell us to stand up to racism and punch a nazi
  nayrt but theres this mythical tool called google that might give you an idea of why some people dislike it when others do that
  its not making fun its reporting people to their jobs and instigating a witch hunt over literally nothing yet the jobs will bend because they literally dont give a fuck about worker rights    this dox bullshit has gone on far enough the op deserves what she gets for being a lil bitch
  ive found people saying it doesnt matter and ive also found people saying its racist/bad taste/whatever no one quite pinpoints why it is wrong to use make up to change your skin color to the character youre cosplaying    also it seems to be a usa only thing
  ymmv but basically its considered bad taste because the usa has a history of using blackface as a way to both shit on brown people and to prevent those people from getting work in hollywoodwhich more recently bled into the cosplay world with an absolute vengeance around when avatar the last airbender had that horrid movie adaptation the casting calls called for something like white or other ethnicity and people lost their shit but that was when it started really being a thing in the cosplay community     theatrical makeup has a history of requiring people to darken their skin for stage because you know bright lights so there was some crosswank between the sidesblackface/brownface/yellowface/whatever that takes an employment opportunity from someone whos actually the race of a character theyre auditioning for is an issue in the film world and sometimes for stage too but honestly community theatre has the opposite issue sometimes lots of troupes get stuck having to fill roles based on voice alone but that gets less wank but that is literally almost never the case in cosplay if your technical skill is spotperfect in recreating a cartoon character but youre a different race doing your makeup wont stop anyone else from doing the same character at a con but people dont like when things dont line up perfectly and there are enough people who suck at makeup that it ends up looking like shitty caricature anyway so nobody can have nice things    also back to topic my worst cosplay experience was someone groping my chest to see if i was actually a boy i was not and i was not binding and the girl then also asked to taste my hair to see if that was real because yaoicon i was cosplaying duo maxwell from gundam wing
  tried to ruin someones life for tanning for a cosplay of a fictional character  it backfires   youre a piece of shit anon and you completely deserved it
  people kill each other in this world and youre whining about coloring skin in 2018   pull back reset chill
  thinking your actually speaking up for genuine and real racism by basically bullying some kid online playing dress up  get upset when you dont get asspats and instead get a bunch of people angry at you for your own malicious actions    oh fuck me dead
    walked in hotel room to see my boyfriend cuddling with his friend while she was wearing fake boobs for her ryuko cosplay
  changing your skin color for cosplay isnt blackface its a cosplayer trying to look as accurate to the character as possible youre an idiot
post cosplay photoshoots that really work with their setting and theme no limit on the type of cosplay show game anime movie comic etc as long as it looks like it would fit into the source material
i started a thread like this a long time ago but ive lost my original folder its been a while since ive been on the board so i hope i can find some new ones
  this is clearly just a boring church with dirty stairs and not an atmospheric castle try again
  i appreciate the effort they put in
this is a beautiful thread idea and wonderful pictures thank you op/contribootors
    yikes im so glad someone cosplayed machiko but i wish she hadnt used that shiny fabric and i wish the photographer had told her to untuck her belt from her corset before shooting
this is my shit i specialise in doing these sort of photos with my cosplays too scared to self post yet though so just keeping an eye on the thread to see if anyone posts any ha
  youre welcome anon these are my favorite cosplay photoshoots so i save whatever i find      i understand the fear but you should post and disguise it during a dump so no one knows    i feel kind of sad how afraid cosplayers are of self posting nowadays back in 2008 cosplayers self posted and tripd all the time guess things are different now especially with so many nitpicky salty people
  fucking love this one
yesss this is my favourite kind of thread thank you op ill try to dig some up from an old folder
  sympathy crime flashbacks intensify
  how isnt she wet was this her first try is she jumping into the water jesus christ i have so many questions how this shot was even made omg
i really like the snow ones ok
  the water clearly isnt more than ankle deep so shed just land on her knees the actual cosplay wouldnt touch the water and she could just dry off and go again
  ahah thanks how i didnt think of it i feel dumb as shit immediatelly thought of sea and deep water
end dump  wow i had a lot more than i realized ending with what you started with op
  is that all you got or is that just the end of your current dump
woah
  woah
    woah
  be brave enough to destroy your dress in water  dont be brave enough to dive a little deeper to get better picture
  woah
  9999999  woah
  whoa thanks for blessing my thread friend      thanks for all your contributions gulls i was worried it wouldnt get many replies but you came through
  do you remember this cosplayers name
  i understand the fear but if you selfpost then people can find you  book you so many of the cosplay photographers that actually advertise themselves just want to do glamour shots/senior picturelooking photos and it gets boring
sorry in advance for the aot spam im a loser
  i love this one it makes him seem much smaller      this too im always happy to see p4 love
  oh im not a cosplay photographer im a cosplayer who happens to do their own photos cant be arsed dealing with people booking me for themselves ha
  hey anon  what do you plan on
  imagine bringing a fancy camera into that place lmfao
  its very meteor city though worth it
  i just witnessed
i found a bunch of stuff i saved incoming dump
end dump
this is a good thread
  i love this shot but goddamn those poorly shooped blood stains are ruining it
  yeah i wished they had used makeup ugh but it was really nice otherwise for the feels so it stays in my favs mostly i wanna do a shoot like this someday
  photo right from the connichi plaza  knowing where this was taken just totally kills the atmosphere for me
        d grayman this makes my heart bleed in all the good ways _
  whatshisnamejpg  syaoran li
  that random monk in the background really sells this for me
  is it really ive never been so i had no idea      aahhh conan  if i find any more dgm this good ill be sure to share it in thanks    i think that might be a statue but blurred like that it really does contribute to the pic
  have some more conan anon
  oml this is the greatest thing i have ever seen     i dunno what this is unless ocs but its really cool    that is amazing    this one feels like a movie shot
  the girls from     are from the mummy 2 i think should be ancksunamun and nefertiti
  syaoran li  thanks anon kind of embarrassed i forgot his name but its been years    thanks for all the conan by the way i started over and have been trying to catch up and its just as thrilling as it was when i was younger
  tthose holy septs of 9s  were witnessing history guys
  dem legs  clamp approved
  checked
  this shot is stunning and the photographer should be so incredibly proud
    magi this made my day thanks anon
great thread   any photogs lurking this thread pls give me general tips to get better thanks
  fushigi yugi love  makes me happy
  god damnit
to the anons posting dgm and conan i love you with all my heart and soul i used to be a weeby lavi back in the day and kid has always been a guilty pleasure dream cosplay of mine     im saving all the pics for future reference this thread is one of the best ive seen in a while
  youre welcome  i love lavi and kaito kid as well and tyki mikk  i do have more dgm and dc/kid stuff on my comp so i could do a dump im currently on mobile  depending on how much it is i might even consider creating a separate thread so i dont derail this general one no idea how many pics i actually have since i havent checked those folders in ages lol
  if youre a photographer dont be afraid to step back a few yards and capture more of the bg in the shot the cosplayer /wants/ you to get the setting in a location shoot in addition to a few upclose/detail shots before you step back let the cosplayer know what mood/action/feel youre aiming for so they have the chance to come up with a pose for it it helps to have an assistant with a phone who can duck out of frame  that way if you get far away like across a river you can call/text the assistant to direct the cosplayer     if youre a cosplayer ive found this one depends more on the photogs vision a lot of cosplay photographers are wrapped up in portrait/graduationstyle photography so even if theyve taken the time to scout out a location theyre not really framing compositions or shots to maximize the location communicate with your photographer as the shoot goes on  let them know that youd like to get the castle in the background or get more of the setting here so they dont feel like they need to be crowding your grill the whole time it also helps to have a few reference images saved to your phone or sent to the photog ahead of time  screenshots from a show will help or stock images of poses youd like to recreate
  those one is cute
  this there are so many amazing locations around the world that can really bring your cosplay to life no matter where you are if you have a photog youre close with dont be afraid to mention a good place a lot of photogs love these types of shoots but theyre not always sure if their subject is willing to go the extra mile    this makes me wish we had a cosplay photography thread im not a photog or i would start one myself
  that aladdin the animated series cosplay hits
    that or she did the jump on dry land and photoshopped her body over water
this photographer has a lot of great atmospheric work
dumping
  im sure there was a fair amount of photoshop involved but i would love to see this photogs process
  sorry not sure why it does that
  fuck
    anon give up even rotated correctly this isnt anything special
i guess this question fits within this threads topic who are your favorite photogs   just looking for suggestion for people to follow
  seconding this question a lot of my images i just stumble upon but i would love to see photogs who do work like this often
  its a matter of perspective some small sticks towns like mine dont have aesthetic buildings/architecture europe definitely has more opportunities for castles/churches bc   theyre fucking everywhere
  dont get defensive small town anon the setting isnt why this lacks atmosphere its the bland lighting and depth of field that sucks all the magic out of it
gonna dump the few i have love this thread so far
  the mirrored effect across the underside of the surface is probably an intentional artistic choice and the full shoot may have had deeper dive photos too
  i love this one
  hit the image limit but it was fun diving through my folder
  make a new thread if youve got more to dump please these were really nice
  thanks its nice to know that people are actually seeing these im going to take the image limit as a sign from the universe to go to sleep right now but might check back tomorrow to see if someone else has started a new one
i dont have much content on this phone but i made another thread        thanks to everyone who posted in this one there was really gorgeous stuff
  nugget  fucking incredible
  0/10 not playing blitzball underwater
  trolling aside do you think it would even be possible to get a photo of that from a photog perspective what would you need to make that happen ive always wondered how people take underwater shots
  theres special waterproof equipment for underwater photography
  yeah but could you get it deep enough and still have enough light to capture a scene like from the games
  i would imagine you use angles to give the illusion you are deeper then any touchups in photoshop

any recommendations for fairy kei posters on instagram im getting tired of westerners wearing ugly sublimation printed indie brand skirts and a mediocre pastel sweater and calling it fairy kei
new acdc rag winter jackets and matching pants          
  you can pretty much forget ig by now its flooded by 1113yo tag abusers and sponsorship spambots
  
   westerners wearing ugly sublimation printed indie brand skirts and a mediocre pastel sweater and calling it fairy kei  im trying to find a video relevant to this on youtube but basically someone asks girls what mascot they think is the most kawaii one example was pikachu versus hello kitty and at the end of the video they revealed what came up in google for kawaii if they searched in english many of the girls commented that the search results in english were not really kawaii and more like tacky something they would like maybe in elementary school
  you mean 
  its so bizarre to me that the west cant seem to get kawaii right you see shitty kaweewee stuff when you walk into a mall and find stores that cater to nerds and nerd culture like hot topic lunchbox etc perhaps bigger companies that make the cheap products dont care to get it right and younger weebs who know little to nothing about japanese kawaii buy it because its all that is available and want to feel tied to kawaii culture i see this especially with the boom of tokidoki stuff its so fugly and yet it sells on the idea of being like a japanese kawaii brand kawaii in the west seems to be walking into claires finding a tshirt of a blushing cupcake with text that reads dont hate me because im beautiful and then being satisfied with that
  yes thank you so much i could have sworn i saw it on tv or something
  i think the issue originates from pokemon being one of the first things to being introduced as kawaii in the west a lot of the early pokemon had eyes like that and people just copypasted pikachus eyes on everything neopets and gaia online came along and a strange kind of kawaii formed
  tshirt of a blushing cupcake with text that reads dont hate me because im beautiful    i hate shit like that     i hate that most kawaii stuff in merica is just a chibi object with big eyes
again new lf but only one pastel piece
   only one pastel piece  i dont know why jfashion brands arent putting out more pastels right now its one of the bigger winter trends this year pastel outerwear/statement pieces so theyre missing out      to me the most prevalent problem with westerner take on kawaii and fairy kei/pop kei/yume is that its too much its like if you arent overflowing with googly keys and stars/hearts/bows/etc than youre not kawaii enough when reality is that you just overdid it    im going to dump some coordinates that i think do kawaii simply
  also some western examples that i think do a pretty good job of not doing too too much
  i dont know why jfashion brands arent putting out more pastels right now its one of the bigger winter trends this year pastel outerwear/statement pieces so theyre missing out    for western fashion fall in japan is usually where jp brands throw tartan on the shelves    im going to dump some coordinates that i think do kawaii simply  theres also the opposite too tho people that think wearing western wigprint teepastel bottom is enough which shows a lot in the google image search results for fairy kei pic related shows as first result for me
    ive been frustrated for years that western kawaii just seems so off the fact the girls from the article in  say i would have liked it in elementary school probably answers why its seen as something really only for kids so the quality isnt high and the designers for western kawaii dont care as much since everyone knows kids have little to no taste especially in america where action and coolness and maturity is king and overall even girls and young women might see whats popular with girls of the same age in japan and go thats too childish its just a cultural thing    i will say the chibi cupcake/avocado/screwdriver/etc thing really really really needs to die if i had to kill one kawaii trend in the west it would be chibi things with faces and silly quotes unicorns and mermaids and whatever can stay but by god stop putting braindead  faces on everything
   google image search results for fairy kei pic related shows as first result for me  yeah thats why i wanted to dump outfits without that sort of formula the sort of dreamy simple kawaii feeling from fairy kei is what i love about it so much
  does anyone know where to buy the items here that arent the printed tops specifically the bottom middle girl is that skirt available anywhere for sale
  as someone who loves tokidoki i dont find tokidoki kawaii its graffitistyle art i guess youre right though that most might see it as kawaii
    i dont think tokidoki is the worst offender at least not like say shopkins it reminds me more of something like lisa frank than it does hello kitty though
  i definitely agree with this i dont think its even trying that much to be kawaii it would use pastels more if it did
  this so much  i dont know if you have this brand overseas but in australia theres this stationary company called smiggle that has always been made for 2nd graders but when i was in primary school they made cool shit like colour coded everything and these pencil cases with bubble indentations everyone would draw on nowadays i walk past their store in the city and they sell horrible garish kawaiee desoo rainbow unicorn garbage and the worst part is kids eat it up if theyre gonna cash in on kawaii culture at least make it tasteful a rilakkuma copy is still leagues better that glittery unicorn diarrhoea
        to sum it up in a single pic
   that funko pop  why does that look so cheap
  because it is really cheap the nendoroid is about three times the price of the funko pop      why do you care about what kids eat up of course theyre going to eat up crap      why the fuck would the west do kawaii right the shit that sells right now makes plenty of money this just reads to me like ninhogo people have superior taste desu     fairy kei has never been super mainstream in japan and as far as i can tell its even less so now though ive never been to japan so dont quote me on it something niche in japan isnt going to be big in america either
  some things are cheap but dont look cheap so funko pop really has no excuse     if you want to compare them with something in the same price range though see pic related
  last reponse anon here i didnt intend to insinuate that the japanese are superior at all its more a frustration with /how/ kawaii is marketed here how kawaii as a whole is bastardized    there is an unwillingness for the western market to look at kawaii as something beyond being for children i understand that the culture in western countries take where im from for example the us and their standards as to what is childish differ from japans but i do have the right to be frustrated at how low and shitty the production standards are as someone who enjoys and consumes kawaii goods western markets took kawaii a concept and aesthetic meant for all ages in japan and commodified it in a very narrow vision of it being cheap and only for kids sure its easy to import kawaii goods from japan especially with access to shopping services its still annoying to see it as it is here in the west i only wish that if kawaii is to be embraced and marketed that it be thought of in a more outside the box way and with a variety of an audience in mind hope this better explains my point
  ive said this for years but theres a very easy very specific formula to make things look kawaii and western brands just dont understand it its all about eye and mouth placement if you look at kawaii mascots like rilakkuma molang and quite a few sanrio characters youll notice how little vertical space there is between the eyes and the mouth this works great on things like animals but it doesnt translate well to dolls thats one of the reasons other than shitty quality that i think funko pops look so weird western toy creators try to create dolls or toys with this ratio and it just looks odd also many westerners are super off put by anime so they toe the line between western and anime styles that just look like shit it seems most of these toy creator have never spoken with someone who wears jfash either shitty unmatched coords that break the rules of pretty much every fashion
   if kawaii is to be embraced and marketed that it be thought of in a more outside the box way  this x1000   kawaii has become so mainstream due to social media platforms like instagram its hard not to want something decent when brands are pandering so hard to the audience unicorn/mermaid everything for example taking into account booms of kawaiiinspired cartoons my little pony steven universe star versus and pastel clothing being everywhere also a byproduct of kpop boom its weird that western kawaii is still so off from what theyre aiming to replicate
  its weird that western kawaii is still so off from what theyre aiming to replicate  depends on the brand honestly and at least for toy brands its likely because the head staff is usually very old dudes    however when it comes to western jfash indie brands i would blame the fact that kawaii goods was the first to get really popular and all she does is low quality art
release next month
because you guys seem to love pastel knits  
   kawaii goods  what ever happened to them i used to like their accessories but nowadays all i see is cheaply printed clothing
  what ever happened to them  nothing happend just somebody that refuses to get a job and clings to her old fame because she is almost 40 if she isnt already never had a real job because autism hoarder children etc
  i agree i had some bunny ears and a couple threeway pins she used to make they were actually really quality maybe she just started thinking she could draw pasted it on some clothes and is trying to make it work
  during some baby the stars shine bright drama it was leaked that the staffers would laugh at westerners and say that westerners dont know how to do kawaii or make cute things right i absolutely agree and think its a uniquely japanese thing i think its just because theyve embraced it for so long and theres nothing gay or childish about cute things there there is literally a kawaii culture that the west seems to downplay but its very real
  it doesnt take much to get kawaii right tho but most companies dont bother doing research they just think kawaiicute and done
ank rouge got a collab with maki up for preorder
  its seen as something really only for kids  this pretty much eurofag here  i love this fashion but if id wear it on the streets here id hear constant laughing behind my back and even in my face and thats just tiring and not worth it  people even laugh at people in costumes on halloween weekend so go figure
  people even laugh at people in costumes on halloween weekend so go figure  sounds like they all need some mental help
listen flavor lucky packs will release in few weeks pic related seems to be this years exclusive tee design
the annual fairy kei picnic looks like larme at this point  
  and another one  
  i wouldnt even call this any specific kind of style let alone larme desu they kind of just look casual normie  on that note id be happy with a fairy kei and early larme blend if it ever happened
  bless you anon im adding this to my next taobao haul
on the topic of pastel knits anyone have any vintage looking knitting patterns for similar tacky but endearing sweaters they are my aesthetic
  not knit but cute either way  
  also pants  
new to this but could any of you describe to me what the fairy kei aesthetics are to you like what are the dos what are the donts yknow that kind of stuff
  based on 80s kids popculture my little pony popples care bears etc with layered pastel vintage outfits there is a lot you can do wrong but in most cases people just lack the vintage feeling in their outfit with slapping on random pastel animu stuff from redbubble and call it a day also wierd ott makeup
  dreamy 80s girly fluffy pastel the donts are anime shit too much normie clothes  too many bright colors
latest cute bags from creamy ice
  im more on the nile perch end of the spectrum less 80s influence and more general cute stuff but fairy kei is just a massively comfy style moodwise  do  varying textiles fur knit etc  enough layers to be warm in antarctica  multiple colours  a handmade look/vibe  natural hair  i personally like to include a comfy motif eg fruits cats teddies etc    dont  menhera  anime and kawiwi desu x3 characters   pants you can attempt but theyve become a fakeboi staple  piercings and tatts if possible  going overboard with the makeup
  you know what while i remember im gonna drop some good ig accounts im just going through my follows so pardon if some of you already know about some of them  sakura_kushu2  asami333  cucula810  fluffybunnyclub  uramo88  haruca_girlyhandmade  gunifuni  these last 4 are artists not directly related to fairy kei but still inspiring  pipnpop  chikuwamiel_art  unfilteredooze their embroidery is amazing  michirutron
  whereeee are those lace camisoles from
  spank but unfortunately theyre one of their ooak reworked vintage pieces and they sold long ago
  thank you at least the ribbon alterations look easy enough so that i can try diying it
  i think pants can be super cute but i agree you have to be careful i tend to wear pastel colored jeans with my outfits especially when it gets a little colder outside mahoudolly does pants really well imo
  i like this a lot
again some 390 x mlp collab
  look at sizing  can fit a variety of waists  but the hip size is always male tier    do asians really have no ass even the chubby ones
  having hips and a butt is really not a good thing in asia slender hips and legs are considered more beautiful and youthful and its a population that already tends to be more slender/less waisthip differential compared to the west so yes asians have no ass and actively try not to have one
  its good for me and my toothpick body so i cant complain
does anyone have any favorite fancy outfit pics with sweaters like these since its getting cooler out 
    i didnt believe this happened until i went to finland and saw all my friends getting stared at and harassed    but yikes and they say we americans are the rude ones
  sauce for the one with the little cows on it i love it
  tbh mocos coords are always on point
  i love moco so much thank you anon
  god they have too much cute stuff  
  
are the oversized tshirts associated with some styles usually just standard fit shirts that are a few sizes too big or are they cut a certain way sorry bout the basic question
  a few of my oversized tshirts are a bit wider on the bottom kind of like they flare out just a tiny bit which most standard tshirts dont do i think its to fit over tutus or poofy skirts
rec me some jackets please and thank you
      snagged the pink colorway of this a while back and i adore it
  would be useful to know what temperatures for  
  
  
  
  would be useful to know what temperatures for  doesnt matter my state is bipolar it starts off cold in the mornings then gets hot in the afternoons and sometimes its just hot or just cold i was looking for more than one jacket so light and heavy and anything in between is fine
rip candye syrups shop
what is the name for that style of hat in the op pic the one with the overalls/long stripe shirt under the white tee
  bucket hat
cherry seems to be on a fairy kei spree  new madetoorder prints  
can i get some fancy style fairy kei brand recommendations i like fancy a la mode and nile perch if this helps
  you probably know all already fancy is even more dead than general fk anyways
what is with the obession with baby themed motifs lately in fk ive been seeing it from brands i follow all over instagram is it because people like tavuchi who also created spank kei are all getting older and having kids so its on their minds my only gripe is that people would think i was into ageplay if i bought any of it it just repels me
  babyshower motifs have always been a thing in fk you probably just notice them now for whatever reason
  this ive got quite a few baby shower themed items but i only wear them to events nowadays since the rep of baby themed items  ageplayer nowadays with normies
miracle added new stock
still on preview but release is next month  
lf released the annual dr collab
  every brand sold at 
  and if you like irl stores  
   rep of baby themed items  ageplayer nowadays with normies  is ageplay a comment that commonly gets tossed around with normies i might just be lucky but ive never heard or seen any of my friends or strangers ever talk about ageplay in relation to my outfits but i see it all the time on cgl
  with people under 30 yes you can thank melanie martinez for that considering they sell her ddlg merch at hot topic
  i thought mm was cancelled ive seen plenty of people calling out her aesthetic as a blatant ripoff of jfash and/or predatory and disturbing especially after the accusation came out is she really that much of an influence that people still associate pastel jfash with her
  nobody cared anymore after it was proven that her exbff made everything up for attention
  oh hell yes those boots are so cute
yru and strangecvlt have 50 off their shoes today
  these would be so much cuter if they didnt look like an eight year old scrawled their initials on the side in blue sharpie ruins the entire shoe imo
